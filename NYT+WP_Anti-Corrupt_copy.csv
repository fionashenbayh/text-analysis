DATE,COUNTRY,TEXT25-Jul-94,EUROPE (97%); FRANCE (94%); SPAIN (94%); ITALY (91%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (79%); AFRICA (79%); EASTERN EUROPE (73%); GERMANY (73%);,"The anti-corruption fever that led to more than 4,000 Italian politicians and businessmen being implicated in the exchange of bribes for government contracts appears to be spreading across the continent, to France, Spain, Germany and some East European countries. More than two years after Milan's prosecuting judges launched a probe that ultimately brought down Italy's postwar ruling establishment, magistrates in other European countries are chasing suspected scandals with such zeal that many political and business leaders are sweating over possible consequences. ""We have touched just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Thierry Jean-Pierre, a French judge who has been pursuing corruption leads in high places for several years. ""We still have not gotten close to exposing the worst abuses of power, but there is now a powerful determination, by the public and judges alike, to get to the root of institutional corruption."" Jean-Pierre, whose celebrity helped him win election recently to the European Parliament, has published a ""Black Book"" describing what he calls common scams that have enriched French politicians and their party treasuries. Besides kickbacks on government contracts and arms sales abroad, he says one of the most popular forms of political financing has been the systematic skimming of development aid intended for France's former colonies in Africa. For years, Jean-Pierre and other French magistrates were hamstrung by their political masters in ruling parties on both the right and the left. But thanks to the heroic example of Italian prosecutors and to strong public support, French judges are displaying boldness in challenging corrupt practices that long went unpunished. Corruption is nothing new in Europe, where a culture of patronage, petty bribery and cash kickbacks has long been indulged as an emblem of Old World sophistication. But in recent months, a spate of high-profile arrests, growing sensitivity to white collar crime and new revelations about the endemic nature of corruption has shaken public confidence in government. In turn, the investigating judges have emerged in the public eye as the last defenders of honesty and altruistic virtue, while the politicians and businessmen they have placed under scrutiny are scrambling to salvage their reputations and justify what they contend was ""business as usual."" Several factors have driven the anti-corruption campaign in Europe. In Spain and France, the decentralization of political power over the past decade has enhanced the authority of local and regional authorities -- and expanded bribery possibilities. The rising cost of campaigning has left politicians and their parties strapped for cash and desperate for ways to raise it, even by illicit means. And the growth of European stock markets has forced many companies to lift the secrecy from their accounts. Jean-Luc Mathieu, a leading French economist, attributes the anti-corruption drive sweeping the continent to a belated backlash against the ""get rich quick"" ethics that overtook Europe, as well as the United States, during the economic boom of the 1980s. ""The weakening of business morals and the occasions for corruption became so rampant that it was only a matter of time before investigations and condemnation would follow,"" Mathieu said. ""And the desire for revenge is also stronger because the disparity between rich and poor has gotten bigger."" Pierre Milza, a professor at France's Institute of Political Studies, says the passing of the Cold War has forced Western societies to examine their moral foundations, including corrupt practices that for years were overlooked in the interests of sustaining political stability. ""Western democracies can now afford to look inward and examine their ethical bases because they are no longer so worried about questions of survival and security,"" he said. ""As a result, corruption is being revealed much more than before in many industrial societies, including Japan."" Many experts say the corruption issue in Europe could unleash political turmoil unless the public sees that justice is done. Even popular governments can plummet in public esteem with the first whiff of scandal. Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, for example, has lost his once unassailable stature because of corruption charges that have stung his government. ""None of our countries is immune to the disease of corruption, and the gangrene is spreading,"" said Peter Leuprecht, secretary general of the 32-nation Council of Europe. ""We believe in pluralist democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights, and all three are threatened by corruption."" Leuprecht said that while France, Italy and other Western countries are making headway in exposing corruption, there are signs that the scourge of bribery is eroding public faith in the nascent democracies of Eastern Europe to the point of evoking nostalgia for cast-off communist dictatorships. Voters have cited disgust with corruption as a major reason for casting ballots for the successors of discredited communist parties. Under communism, East European bureaucrats might have pocketed a small bribe to let a farmer jump the line to get a new tractor. But now they are in positions to decide deals worth millions of dollars, Leuprecht says. The temptation to extort kickbacks is so strong for officials toiling on tiny salaries that a recent Council of Europe study estimates that corruption is adding 10 percent to 15 percent to consumer costs in Central and Eastern Europe. It is in France, however, where judges predict the most dramatic developments in exposing corruption may occur in the months to come. Presidential elections are scheduled early next year, and political maneuvering is likely to produce explosive charges on both the right and the left. Once held in check by the political power of the central government, French judges have not flinched from challenging imposing targets. Within the last two months, the chairmen of two of France's leading enterprises, Schneider and Alcatel Alsthom, have been jailed for interrogation about misappropriated funds. They were subsequently released and denied the charges, but the cases are still under scrutiny. The country's biggest water utilities are under fire for overcharging customers and making illegal political contributions to win public contracts. Jean-Pierre said two large corporations -- presumably the water companies Lyonnaise des Eaux and General des Eaux -- ""are responsible for 80 percent of the political corruption in France."" The companies have denied any wrongdoing. Meanwhile, judges have declared open season on politicians across the ideological spectrum. On the left, former Socialist ministers have been accused of embezzlement, while tycoon-turned-politician Bernard Tapie has been charged with fraud and tax evasion. On the right, two members of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's cabinet are facing corruption charges, while the Gaullist mayor of Lyons is suspected of receiving stolen funds. Even more serious charges of corruption are encircling French President Francois Mitterrand as he nears the end of his 14-year reign. One of Mitterrand's closest friends, Roger Patrice-Pelat, was indicted on charges of insider trading shortly after the state-owned firm Pechiney took over American Can Co. in 1988. Patrice-Pelat died while the investigation was underway, but this month Alain Boublil, a former adviser to then-Economy Minister Pierre Beregovoy, received a two-year sentence for tipping off Patrice-Pelat. Another of Mitterrand's close friends, Francois de Grossouvre, who gave testimony in the Pechiney case, had complained about corruption surrounding the president shortly before committing suicide at his desk in the Elysee Palace in April. Grossouvre's lament about Mitterrand's friends and family profiting from his position did not expire with his passing. A book by investigative journalist Jean Montaldo recounting Grossouvre's charges of corrupt practices by the president's cronies, entitled ""Mitterrand and the 40 Thieves,"" has soared to the top of best-seller lists, with readers buying up 375,000 copies within a month of publication."8-Aug-97,"KENYA (95%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (79%);","The International Monetary Fund, stepping up efforts to combat corruption in the developing world, has adopted a new policy of denying financial assistance to countries where graft threatens to undermine their economic recovery programs. And showing that it means business, the IMF -- which in the past has based most of its lending decisions strictly on economic criteria -- is cutting off a $ 220 million loan to Kenya because of the refusal of Kenyan authorities to clean up pervasive bribery and self-enrichment. Kenya's currency has plunged as much as 20 percent this week as a result. The moves are among the most significant in a series of recent measures taken against corruption by aid agencies, Western governments and international organizations. They come in the wake of criticism aimed at the IMF and other aid donors over the blind eye that they allegedly turned toward rampant bribe-taking in Zaire during much of Mobutu Sese Seko's 32-year reign. Mobutu's corruption and repression spurred a rebellion that toppled him in May, and the nation was renamed Congo. The IMF's new policy, enshrined in guidelines approved Monday by its board, does not mean that IMF money will be withheld from any country where payoffs are common. Rather, it amounts to a warning that the IMF may pull the plug on a country when it believes corruption to be so corrosive as to endanger the attainment of goals specified in a recovery plan. ""Financial assistance from the IMF . . . could be suspended or delayed on account of poor governance,"" the guidelines state, ""if there is reason to believe it could have significant macroeconomic implications that threaten the successful implementation of the program, or if it puts in doubt the purpose of the use of IMF resources."" ""The guidelines are very important,"" said Frank Vogl, vice chairman of Transparency International, an anti-corruption advocacy group. ""It's long overdue that multilateral organizations involved in financing developing countries place on a par with macro policies the basic soundness of the government institutions with which they're dealing."" The cutoff of the loan to Kenya, he added, ""sends a signal, especially because the guidelines are being issued at around the same time."" Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi blasted the IMF's decision as ""purely political,"" according to press reports from Nairobi. The developments reflect a rising determination in Western capitals, especially Washington, to crack down on corruption. IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and World Bank President James D. Wolfensohn have vowed in major policy addresses to take action based on research showing that bribe-taking by public officials tends to impede development, because scarce government funds are funneled into unproductive investments to earn payoffs. The guidelines state that the IMF should not ""interfere in domestic or foreign politics"" of a borrowing country. But they call for its employees to point out the economic consequences of corrupt practices that they may perceive during the periodic consultations they hold with government officials from the IMF's 131 member countries. And in the cases of countries borrowing from the IMF that have been judged to be seriously plagued by corruption, its staff might insist, for example, on ""the removal of individuals from involvement in particular operations where corruption had occurred,"" according to the guidelines. The Kenya loan was suspended late last week because anti-corruption measures the government was taking ""fall short of meeting the clearly expressed concerns of IMF member countries in the area of governance,"" according to an IMF statement. The suspension came just before the board's approval of the guidelines. An IMF official said the move was ""probably the first time that we have said openly that governance issues were at stake"" in such a decision. The suspension followed the Kenyan government's dismissal of its top customs official, Samuel Chebii, who is widely regarded as a crusader for cleaning up corruption in the nation's notoriously graft-ridden ports."31-Oct-99,"KENYA (94%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (94%); UZBEKISTAN (93%); INDONESIA (93%); CAMEROON (93%); NIGERIA (93%); AZERBAIJAN (92%); GERMANY (92%);","LIKE music CD's, box office receipts and the world's richest people, corruption has its own top 10 list. For the last five years Transparency International, a nonprofit group based in Berlin that specializes in tracking global thievery, has released the annual Corruption Perceptions Index, ranking the world's most corrupt countries. Last week the group declared Cameroon, Nigeria, Indonesia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Honduras, Tanzania, Yugoslavia, Paraguay and Kenya as the world's most graft-ridden countries, populated by public officials who are much quicker to take bribes than their counterparts in countries like Denmark, New Zealand and Sweden. But while Transparency's work has been lauded by economists and other analysts for helping to make corruption a centerpiece of debates about economic development and public policy, critics say the group's hit list unfairly tars countries that may be no more corrupt than those ranked much lower on the list. Indeed, the critics say the media is so quick to latch on to top 10 lists that agencies like Transparency International have an obvious incentive to present their information that way to score public relations coups. All the attention generated by the Corruption Perceptions Index, and criticism that it tended to highlight poor countries without noting the role that industrialized countries play in fomenting corruption abroad, led Transparency to introduce yet another ranking last week -- the Bribe Payers Index. ""One of the worries people have had is that the ranking is very misleading,"" Rafael di Tella, an economics professor at Harvard Business School and one of Transparency's outside advisors, said of the Corruption Perceptions Index. ""Transparency International has become a slave to the success of the index and it doesn't want to address the problem."" The problem, as Mr. di Tella and others see it, is that the data used to analyze corruption -- surveys, for example, of business executives' perceptions -- are so fuzzy that huge margins of error exist when assigning a numerical yardstick to graft. Johann Graf Lambsdorff, a German statistician responsible for orchestrating Transparency's numbers into a coherent whole, says critics of the list unfairly imply that his methodology is faulty when, in fact, the only issue is how the results of Transparency's surveys are presented. Even so, Mr. Lambsdorff says he is comfortable with his group's list. ""A ranking is easier to convey information to a large public, like a football ranking,"" said Mr. Lambsdorff, a professor at Gottingen University. ""We can clearly say that Denmark is cleaner than Germany and Germany is cleaner than Botswana. But in between there may be some problems -- saying that Kenya is cleaner than Tanzania, for example."" But that is precisely the problem, say critics, pointing to Bolivia's Presidential election in 1997 as an example of the list's far-reaching influence. The former dictator Hugo Banzer won the Presidency that year on an anti-corruption platform bolstered by the release of Transparency's rankings shortly before the election -- rankings showing that corruption in Bolivia was worse than in many of its neighbors. Mr. Lambsdorff says Transparency cannot avoid having such an impact because elections are occurring in many countries when their rankings are released. ""We keep on stressing that these are perceptions, not hard facts,"" said Frank Vogl, Transparency International's vice-chairman and co-founder. ""You always have this problem of how to present the data."" Nonetheless, the list has stirred dissent within the group's own membership. ""Transparency's index was good when there were no other numbers available but we need to go further now,"" said Luis Moreno Ocampo, a prominent anti-corruption crusader in Argentina who is a member of Transparency's advisory council. ""The issue is not which country is worse than another, the issue is how to solve the problem. We need to track where the money is going and who is stealing it."" Mr. Moreno has been working with the World Bank to come up with new methods of measuring and presenting data on corruption. Daniel Kaufmann, a senior manager with the World Bank, says grouping countries in broad categories -- rather than ranking them -- is the fairest way to shine a spotlight on corruption. ""The idea that Transparency International had is brilliant and now we all want to be more rigorous and circumspect when we analyze corruption,"" he said.  http://www.nytimes.com"27-Aug-00,AFRICA (99%); UNITED STATES (97%); NIGERIA (94%); GHANA (92%); ERITREA (92%); ETHIOPIA (92%); RWANDA (92%); UGANDA (92%); CAMEROON (79%); EUROPE (79%);,"ON his first trip to Africa two years ago, President Clinton dreamed out loud that his journey would be remembered in a hundred years as ""the beginning of a new African renaissance."" The president singled out four African heads of state whose free-market savvy would help revive the world's poorest continent. Since then, all four leaders -- in Uganda, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Eritrea -- have crippled their nations' economies by going to war. ""We Americans are so desperate for good news on the continent that it is almost irresistible when we find a good man in Africa,"" said Edward P. Brynn, the former American ambassador to Ghana who greeted Mr. Clinton in Accra on the first leg of his 1998 trip. ""The only way we seem to be able to identify success in Africa is through personalization."" This weekend, on a return engagement in Africa, Mr. Clinton is again singing the praises of a good man in Africa. This time it's President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, a former general who was elected last year to lead Africa's most populous country. The Clinton administration has seized on Mr. Obasanjo, whose victory ended years of military dictatorship, as an anchor of democratic stability in restive West Africa. Again, though, there are risks. Mr. Obasanjo presides over a country that is fractured north from south by Islamic extremism. Nigeria is the second-most corrupt nation on earth (after neighboring Cameroon), according to Transparency International, a nonprofit anti-corruption group based in Germany. The former general's record on human rights has already been stained by his order for soldiers to destroy a town in the oil-producing Niger delta. His top aides have been selling their influence. Echoing the concern of many longtime Africa watchers, Mr. Brynn, a former No. 2 in the State Department's Africa bureau in the Clinton administration, says the United States must resist the temptation of ""putting all our eggs in the personality basket."" Mr. Brynn and many others argue that the only way for Americans to help Africa in a meaningful way is to join with European allies in the slow and painfully complex job of rebuilding institutions that have been falling apart for decades. Most important are the civil service, courts, the police and the military. After the collapse of colonialism in the 1960's and the spread of self-rule across most of Africa, early American efforts to aid newly independent states foundered when grants were badly monitored and often stolen by corrupt bureaucrats. In the past decade, the United States and other chastened donors have tended to steer clear of direct aid to governments. Instead, they funnel money through private and religious groups whose work in health care, basic education and small-business development can be monitored more closely. Neither of these approaches, though, has helped cure a continentwide pathology that has turned many African governments into predators. Poorly paid policemen, soldiers and civil servants often use their authority to serve themselves, rather than the public. ""We failed to keep a real hands-on posture with aid,"" said Mr. Brynn, who served as a diplomat on the continent for 17 years in six different countries. ""We allowed a small, clever class that inherited power from the colonial masters to take us to the cleaners. It will take a whole lot of time and money to turn Africa around."" Except in Nigeria, South Africa and a handful of other countries, civil wars and corruption have swamped the African renaissance that Mr. Clinton envisioned two years ago. Much of the continent has resumed a long slide into poverty, war and disease -- a dismal trajectory that has excluded the region from the rapid free-market growth in much of the developing world. That painful pattern suggests that America's next president will be confronted by military and humanitarian crises in Africa that cannot be solved with foreign trips or inspiring speeches -- and quite possibly cannot be solved at all. Out of the 27 major armed conflicts in the world last year, 11 were fought in Africa. Five of the world's 10 most corrupt countries are in Africa, according to Transparency International. A peace deal for Sierra Leone, which the United States helped broker in 1999, collapsed back into war this spring, with United Nations peacekeepers taken hostage. As in Rwanda, where Mr. Clinton apologized two years ago for America's failure to prevent genocide in 1994, the continuing mess in Sierra Leone reveals an absence of international commitment to peacekeeping in Africa. THE AIDS pandemic has accelerated and is threatening to kill up to 25 percent of the population in some African countries. War in Congo has sucked in a half-dozen other African states and shows no signs of ending. A political and economic rot that African scholars call ""failed-state syndrome"" seems to be spreading from countries like Somalia and Sudan to what used to be models of stability -- Kenya, Ivory Coast and Zimbabwe. ""It is a very frightening picture that we face in Africa,"" said J. Stephen Morrison, who left the State Department's policy planning staff last spring after four years of working on Africa policy. ""It makes people exceedingly uncomfortable."" Mr. Morrison, like many experts on Africa, agrees that the United States and European countries need to commit more money and more skilled people to rebuilding African governments. But like many others, he concedes that no one is sure about how to do it or how to persuade African leaders to allow what could be perceived as neocolonial meddling. ""None of us have answers,"" he said. As director of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, Mr. Morrison is preparing a nonpartisan review of Africa policy during the Clinton years to help inform the next administration. ""It is not clear that we have come to terms as a government and a nation about what is truly required to help Africa,"" he said. ""If we come in on the cheap side, it is going to backfire. I think it is fair to say that the Clinton administration has suffered from rhetorical excess in Africa and deficits in terms of will and material commitment."" But Mr. Morrison said the administration has been quick off the mark with significant economic and military assistance to Nigeria. Aid there has jumped from $7 million a year to more than $200 million since Mr. Obasanjo was elected in February 1999. On his trip this weekend, the president is not expected to offer much more money. The stakes are especially high in Nigeria. With 113 million people and huge oil and natural gas reserves, the country has the potential to drive an economic revival in all of West Africa. It is also one of few African states where the United States has a real strategic interest. Oil from Nigeria and Angola accounts for about 16 percent of America's supply, a figure projected to rise to more than 25 percent in the next decade. Washington is also counting on Nigeria's armed forces to restore peace in nearby Sierra Leone. American troops began arriving in Nigeria last week as part of a $20 million program to train and equip Nigerian and Ghanaian soldiers for peacekeeping. ""Are we hanging too much on Obasanjo?"" Mr. Morrison asked. ""That is clearly a danger we face. We have to invest in institution building -- the military, the legislature, getting a handle on corruption. But we cannot do any of this stuff on the cheap. It has got to be sustained beyond this president and beyond Obasanjo."" Spending by the United States government on development assistance in Africa has declined in the past decade. Aid to African nations peaked in the early 1990's at just over $800 million a year, dipped to $675 million in 1996 and grew this year to about $738 million. By comparison, Israel received about $900 million in economic support this year and Egypt about $760 million, according to the Congressional Research Service. The Republican majority in Congress has repeatedly cut the president's budget requests for Africa and has so far failed to approve an administration proposal to forgive about $475 million in African debt. Presidential trips notwithstanding, many experts on Africa (including several who have served in the Clinton administration) agree that Washington is not spending nearly enough money to sustain or even begin the kind of fundamental reform that is the only possible solution to the continent's complex problems. ""You are left with a very weak hand,"" said Gerald Bender, a professor of international relations at the University of Southern California and an expert on Angola. ""You do not have the means to initiate positive things or hold back problems like war."" Mr. Bender and many other African specialists predict that until the United States is willing to work with Europe to pay for a kind of Marshall Plan for Africa, American presidents will have little choice but to follow Mr. Clinton's cheerleading example. Their role, by default, will be to heap praise on the good man of the hour in Africa and hope that he doesn't turn into a bad man who perpetuates his power by stealing his country's future.  http://www.nytimes.com"22-Jan-01,MEXICO (96%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%); GERMANY (55%),"-- In his first seven weeks in office, President Vicente Fox has frustrated critics, and even some members of his cabinet, by moving slowly to investigate the rampant corruption and human rights violations of Mexico's authoritarian governments during the last seven decades. So far, Mexico's long-anticipated transition to a more democratic government has been marked by silence on wrongdoing committed during the long reign of the party Fox ousted, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. The new administration has not released any evidence documenting theft of public funds, bribery, collusion with drug dealers, political killings and espionage by PRI regimes. Fox and members of his cabinet, many of whom were spied on and harassed while in the opposition, have made clear in interviews that debate over how far to delve into the sins of the past is divisive. While some say a reckoning is essential to building democracy, Fox has emphasized the priorities of pushing through political and economic reform. ""We don't want to spend time on the past,"" Fox said in an interview. ""Our time, our talent, our budget will be focused on the future."" Critics say such comments suggest that Fox has decided against throwing open Mexico's dirtiest closets, as happened in South Africa, Germany and other countries that have undergone profound political transitions. They fear the government may pursue a few high-profile cases but avoid a systematic investigation into past abuses. Sergio Aguayo, a scholar and human rights activist, said it was too early in Fox's term to assess policies that are still not fully clear. But he said he worried that Mexico would not fulfill its ""historical debt"" to uncover the past. ""One gets the impression that they don't have as a priority the opening of the files to establish the historical truth,"" Aguayo said. ""The past has given us a heritage of bitterness. In any process of healing you need the truth."" So cautious is the administration's approach that some of Fox's cabinet members have been refused access to the files kept on them under the PRI by the government intelligence service, the Center for Investigation and National Security, or Cisen. Under PRI rule, Mexico was a swamp of government corruption and abuse, with a thriving culture of bribery, theft and entitlement. The public has never had full explanations of the institutionalized fleecing of the public by senior officials, alleged secret government deals with drug barons and kidnappers, the 1968 massacre of demonstrators in Mexico City, the assassination of a leading presidential candidate in 1994, the disappearances of hundreds of anti-government activists over decades, or an obsessive government culture of wiretapping and political espionage. Fox, who campaigned on the promise of building the rule of law, said that at the end of his first 100 days in office he will submit proposals to Congress to revise the intelligence services, establish anti-corruption guidelines and perhaps call for a commission to investigate parts of the past. Some observers say Fox's approach is pragmatic and will help avoid distraction from his major goal of building a new political system in the face of a hostile Congress. Fox's national security adviser, Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, is one of several officials urging the government to move quickly to investigate the past. ""In any political transition, you have to make difficult choices and trade-offs,"" Aguilar Zinser said in an interview. ""But you have to do something, and that something has to be a lot. And we have to do it fast. Time is a critical factor here, because inertias can be created and you give time to those who are destroying records. If you let things drag on, nothing gets done."" Although corruption and other forms of law-breaking have been endemic for years across government agencies in Mexico, much of the attention since Fox's election has focused on Cisen and whether Fox has the will to investigate its record and wrestle it back under honest government control. ""He's scared of what he might find, so it's easier not to go after it too hard. And I think that's a big mistake,"" a top official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Officially responsible for tracking rebel groups, drug traffickers and other threats to national security, Cisen instead became the ruling party's hatchet against its political enemies. Advisers to Fox call the organization, which has about 3,000 employees and a $ 120 million budget, a ""monster."" Its related network of clandestine intelligence agencies -- with alleged links to Telmex, the country's largest telephone company -- is so autonomous that Fox may not be able to fully rein it in. While part of the opposition, Fox was followed and wiretapped, and several members of his cabinet were hounded by Cisen. Even conversations by the president's octogenarian mother were taped by the government. Fox said in 1998, when he was governor of Guanajuato state, ""Everything I say and do, I assume that I am being spied on."" In 1984, Aguilar Zinser was kidnapped briefly and beaten by government thugs because of his criticism of the PRI's policies toward indigenous communities in Chiapas state. He said he believed that his private conversations were taped for years. Aguilar Zinser called the prompt reform of the agency ""a thermometer of how much we want to change."" Mariclaire Acosta, Fox's top human rights adviser, is one of several high-ranking officials who said they believed they were still being taped. Acosta said noise on the line and disruptions in service suggested that the tapping of her phones had increased since she joined Fox's cabinet. ""I think the files have to be opened and the truth has to come out. That has to be done and it has to be done as soon as possible,"" she said in an interview. ""Either you face the past and you come to terms with the past or you do not move forward. If you don't face it squarely, the ghosts come up to haunt you."" Interior Minister Santiago Creel, who holds the second-most powerful post in Mexico after the president, said in an interview that the government was no longer taping politicians. He said he had ""found things out"" about past corrupt practices since taking possession of the ministry, which has controlled law enforcement and intelligence agencies. But he said that making that information public immediately, or simply throwing open the doors to secret archives, was not in the country's best interest. ""Our aim is not big headlines in the paper,"" Creel said. ""It will happen, in time and with a consensus, after bridges are constructed. . . . Our main bet is on the future, not the past."" Creel acknowledged that there is a difference of opinion about how to handle the past among Fox's aides, a diverse group that ranges from leftist intellectuals to conservative business leaders. But he said that criticism that the government is not moving fast enough is unfair. ""We have to make people accountable but we can't do it in 24 hours or even three or four weeks,"" he said. He also said the administration was not interested in ""revenge or a witch hunt."" To clean up Cisen, the government will have to do more than simply turn off the tape recorders. The agency, as with many Mexican law enforcement groups, is widely believed to have been infiltrated by Mexico's powerful organized crime groups. There is widespread suspicion that corrupt officials have sold information gathered by Cisen to kidnappers and drug gangs. Recently, there have been reliable reports of former government officials buying their files from intelligence agents to keep them from surfacing. In addition to Cisen, military intelligence agencies, the police, state and municipal governments and a variety of shadowy spinoff agencies have been involved in taping telephone calls. Aguayo, who is writing a book about the history of intelligence operations in Mexico and was given limited access last year to files of Cisen and its predecessor agencies, was the first outsider to review the files since the 1920s. The scholar said he discovered clear evidence of government involvement in disappearances and killings over the past "27-May-01,KENYA (96%); ZIMBABWE (94%); AFRICA (94%); UNITED STATES (92%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%),"Secretary of State Colin L. Powell met today with Kenya's longtime president, Daniel arap Moi, and urged him to step aside and let a new president be elected next year. That repeated a message General Powell had sent to the president of Zimbabwe earlier on his African tour. General Powell called on Mr. Moi to push through an anti-corruption law in order to re-establish ties with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund; the organizations cut off loans to Kenya four years ago. But Mr. Moi left American officials guessing about his political intentions. Kenyan law calls for elections to be held by December 2002, and Mr. Moi, who is 76 years old and has been in office since 1978, is barred from re-election. Some of his supporters have urged him to change the system and run again, but General Powell suggested he could leave a positive legacy by stepping aside and allowing a new generation to guide the country. After meeting with General Powell today, Mr. Moi spoke cryptically outside the statehouse about General Powell's call for free elections and new leadership. ""I think it is too much always trying to undermine the intelligence of the African people,"" Mr. Moi said dismissively. ""Those who will determine the destiny of Kenya or other countries are the people themselves."" In a speech at a university in Johannesburg the day before, General Powell voiced his belief that some African leaders had clung to power too long. He cited President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, who has headed that country as either president or prime minister for more than two decades. Kenya has been ruled by the Kenya African National Union since its independence from Britain in 1963 and has become in effect a one-party state. Opposition parties are splintered among the country's many tribal groups, and Mr. Moi has used strong-arm tactics to keep rivals at bay. Tribal rivalries have long been an unsettling factor in Kenya's formation as an independent country. General Powell made a point today of meeting with opposition lawmakers such as Mwai Kibaki, a former vice president to Mr. Moi, who has since formed the rival Democratic Party and is regarded as a leading opposition candidate for president. General Powell was also joined in a discussion by Raila Odinga, son of another former vice president, Oginga Odinga. Raila Odinga had been jailed by Mr. Moi for allegedly organizing an opposition movement to topple the government. Some of Mr. Moi's allies have been keeping alive the idea of a another Moi term, leading to much speculation that the president, the son of a herdsman, will cling to the post. Despite his grip on power, Mr. Moi's official biography portrays him as a reluctant stateman who merely filled a leadership void and rebuffed plotters in 1992 who have tried to interrupt his elected leadership. ""Though moves to frustrate and destroy his political career were plotted, he calmly resisted and humbled himself, forgiving those who were after his neck as he assumed power,"" his biography says. A group of Kenyans also sought to press General Powell during his stay here for more compensation for victims of the 1998 bombing of the American Embassy here, which left 224 Kenyans dead and thousands injured. General Powell placed a wreath at a memorial for victims today but he declined to discuss the matter, saying there were lawsuits pending.

Since civilians are often the targets there, it stands to reason that Africa may also be fertile ground in this new era of international justice. So: what signal did the delivery of Slobodan Milosevic to the Hague in exchange for $1.3 billion in assistance to Serbia send to Africa and its often appalling leaders? John Githongo, head of Transparency International in Kenya, an anti-corruption group, believes that the message is mostly a good one for ordinary Africans: that some of their worst leaders may be held to a long-overdue accounting. But that does not stop him from wondering about a new era of confusion and abuse, alongside the hope for greater justice. After all, $1.3 billion is a lot of money -- roughly one-tenth the crippling amount that the continent pays each year to service its debt. What's more, the search for justice for past crimes may provide a way of hiding new ones, or at least major shortcomings in a new regime that may not be much better than the last. Handing over an old leader to The Hague, Mr. Githongo said, ""would have an enormous effect on legitimizing the new regime by saying, 'We haven't done very much but the reason we haven't done very much is that the people before us made such a cockup of everything.' It does distract people."" Most experts dismiss the possibility that the precedent with Mr. Milosevic and the cash promised to Serbia could create ""an export industry in dictators along with diamonds, gold and cobalt,"" as Richard H. Dicker, director of the international justice program at Human Rights Watch, jokingly put it. But the Milosevic extradition, like that of Augusto Pinochet of Chile, does raise "" unique challenges to leadership in Africa,"" Mr. Githongo said. ""And it's only now being discussed."" Africa never had a Nuremberg trial, the decisive point at which Europeans defined what was acceptable and what was not. There is a tribunal to try suspects for the genocide in Rwanda, but some experts argue that its effect has been small, in part because the crimes, while horrific, were so local, and because, until recently, it had achieved few convictions. In any event, Africa experts note that for decades during the cold war, all manner of crimes, both military and economic, were overlooked in the name of geostrategic positioning. Thus Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, Mohamed Siad Barre of Somalia or Samuel Doe of Liberia essentially got a pass to act as they pleased. All that changed with the end of the cold war, and perhaps more pointedly, as the borders of justice dropped to the point where suspects in the Rwandan genocide in 1994 were tried this year in a Belgian court. But many leaders in Africa were slow to recognize those changes and now, in theory, they face a completely new set of rules from the same people who wrote the older, more lenient ones. That could create complications for the imposers of trans-border justice. ""If Mobutu was being taken to court, his lawyers would argue, 'Well, why not the United States government and France and Belgium, who bankrolled him?"" asked Salih Booker, executive director of Africa Action, an advocacy group in Washington. ""That is the only refuge of African dictators that has some basis in fact."" There are some worries that, at least in the short run, the new rules may already be having the effect of prolonging conflict and keeping corrupt leaders in power. In Burundi, for example, ethnic Tutsi leaders have reportedly expressed fear of prosecution for their part in the civil war there, a clear disincentive to leaving office soon. It is analogous to the situation in Kenya, where there have not been questions about crimes against humanity, but where a grant of amnesty on corruption issues has reportedly been put forward as the key to persuading President Daniel arap Moi to end his long rule there. Mr. Githongo argues that for African societies, the international prosecution of former leaders is not yet compatible with more pressing goals. Those societies have a deep need for peace, he said, and focusing narrowly on prosecution now may stir up more immediate conflict. He noted the apparent success of achieving peace in Mozambique after granting some amnesty to end the civil war there a decade ago. ""There are other important issues like reconciliation,"" he said. ""Terrible things have been done. Let's go through a transitional process but let's keep a low profile. Let's not be vindictive."" His argument also raises the larger question of whether trying war criminals is, in fact, the most pressing need for Africa -- a variation of the argument often heard in Africa that AIDS deserves attention but only as one of many problems. Mr. Booker of Africa Action argues that "" justice is almost a necessity for democratic development,"" but he adds: ""At the same time, I would tend to be critical of the conventional human rights community that focus almost entirely on the legalistic approach to justice, to a court-based approach that does not address what may be the greater injustices: denial of access to clean water or to health care or corruption that are the consequences of dictatorial rule."" DESPITE the questions, African nations have largely signed on to the idea of a permanent tribunal for crimes against humanity (even as the United States has dragged its feet). And many argue that international justice provides a new set of laws that ordinary Africans can look to, even if their own leaders ignore them in their own lands. ""When Milosevic was overthrown, the next day in the Ivory Coast people were demonstrating and citing Serbian democracy as an example,"" said Harold Hongju Koh, a Yale law professor who served as President Clinton's chief adviser on human rights. ""So we know that images and educational lessons are now carried through those channels."" This sends the message, he said, that ""a page has been turned, that what was tolerated in the past will not be tolerated in the future. And that has the potential to raise both the communal standards and the continental standards."""20-Jun-02,AFRICA (98%); CARIBBEAN ISLANDS (93%); CANADA (79%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%),"President Bush will propose today to double spending on a U.S. initiative for education in Africa to $ 200 million over five years and will announce plans to travel to the continent next year, senior administration officials said yesterday. The announcement on African education will be the second, relatively modest foreign assistance plan unveiled within two days by an administration that has questioned whether such aid has been wasted on inefficient and corrupt governments. Yesterday, Bush pledged an additional $ 500 million over three years to help prevent HIV-infected mothers in parts of Africa and the Caribbean from transmitting the virus, which causes AIDS, to their infants. ""Medical science gives us the power to save these young lives. Conscience demands that we do so,"" the president declared in a Rose Garden ceremony. The flurry of initiatives come as Bush prepares to head next week to a summit of leaders from the Group of Eight leading industrial nations in Canada, where Africa will be a major focus. The $ 10 billion U.S. foreign aid budget is the lowest among rich countries as a percentage of economic output, and the new proposals could help the administration project a compassionate image at the summit. Most of the 20 million deaths from AIDS have occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV infection rates are the highest in the world. The United Nations estimates that 800,000 children were born last year infected with the virus, even though as little as a single dose of medication to mother and child at birth can prevent transmission up to half the time. Bush's initiative aims to prevent up to 146,000 infant infections over the next five years. It is projected to provide extended treatment with life-extending anti-retroviral drugs for infected infants and their parents in numbers that will increase as the program expands. But while saying the proposals were welcome, activists, aid advocates and some in Congress criticized them as too little, too late. The AIDS initiative focused on the least politically sensitive aspect of care and treatment for a disease that is most often transmitted through adult sexual activity. ""By choosing to focus primarily on 'innocent' newborns,"" said the Global Alliance of activist groups, ""Bush is leaving women, families and communities for dead."" There was also criticism of the size of the funding, and what some saw as an attempt to take credit for congressional initiatives they believed Bush had helped undermine. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), who along with Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) had proposed $ 700 million in new spending this year on global AIDS programs, yesterday called the Bush plan a ""shell game,"" saying it ""provides no funding beyond that already provided by the Senate until the year 2004."" Bush's $ 500 million consists of $ 200 million the House and Senate have already added to the president's proposed emergency terrorism appropriation for this year, which administration officials said would be spent over this year and next, and $ 300 million that Bush said he would put in his fiscal 2004 budget request next year. This year's budget for global AIDS projects is about $ 1 billion, without the new funding. Rock star Bono, a global development advocate who last month accompanied Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill on a 10-day tour of Africa, issued a statement saying: ""This crisis urgently demands an historic presidential AIDS initiative. This isn't it, but could be the beginning of it."" Others in Congress and among nongovernmental organizations said they were glad to have what Bush proposed. Rep. Jim Kolbe (R-Ariz.), who shepherded the House's version of the $ 200 million in emergency funds, said he was ""especially pleased"" by Bush's initiative. Mark Isaac, public policy director at the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, called it ""real leadership . . . in fighting global AIDS."" Isaac said that working with mothers who care more about helping their children than avoiding the stigma often associated with AIDS in the developing world often provided a way to expand prevention and treatment. Paul De Lay, director of the HIV/AIDS office at the U.S. Agency for International Development, said that infants infected even after treatment with nevirapine, the drug used to reduce transmission rates from mothers, would be put on a permanent regime of anti-retroviral drugs, along with those infected mothers and fathers whose stage of disease qualifies them for treatment. The program is initially targeted at eight African countries, to expand to 12 by 2004, plus Guyana and Haiti and a regional program for other Caribbean islands. The plan also includes improvements in health care infrastructure, an exchange program between U.S. and African and Caribbean hospitals and initiatives to provide African women alternatives to breast feeding, which can pass the disease. The education proposal is both an increase in size and a fleshing out of specifics for an initiative that Bush unveiled last year. Administration officials said the money will go to train 420,000 teachers, provide 250,000 scholarships for girls, and provide 4.5 million more textbooks for African schoolchildren. But the level of funding drew a negative reaction from aid advocates. The world's rich nations are being exhorted by the World Bank and other aid agencies to contribute billions of dollars a year to fund an initiative aimed at ensuring that all children in poor countries finish at least five years of schooling by 2015; currently, more than 100 million elementary-school-age children are not in class at all. The United States and other donor nations have backed the plan in principle but not all have been forthcoming with the money. ""I think it's disappointing that the president is thinking on such a small scale when the needs are so great,"" said John Ruthrauff, senior policy adviser at Oxfam America, citing estimates that $ 5 billion a year would be required to meet the U.N.-backed goal of achieving universal primary education by 2015. Administration officials countered by emphasizing the importance of Bush's plans to visit Africa. Noting that Bush earlier this year proposed a 50 percent increase in U.S. foreign aid spending targeted at countries that adopt anti-corruption and free market policies, they asserted that the amount of money is much less important than Bush's demonstrated commitment to African development. ""As the president said today, as the [AIDS] initiative demonstrates success, we will provide more resources to it,"" one senior official said. ""That is this administration's approach -- instead of 'more money, more money, more money,' we're saying, 'more results, more results, more results,' and money will follow results."""26-Jun-02,AFRICA (99%); UNITED STATES (95%); CANADA (94%); ZIMBABWE (93%); SOUTH AFRICA (92%); JAPAN (51%),"THE LEADERS of the leading countries gather in Canada today and tomorrow to talk, among other things, about helping Africa. But the three main channels of assistance that they will discuss are each cluttered with obstacles. The first channel is the ""African Renaissance"" plan put forward by South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki and other African leaders. This commits the continent to democracy, the rule of law and anti-corruption efforts; the hope is that good governance will be rewarded by inflows of fresh capital. It's a good plan in theory and is welcome in that it's written by Africans rather than outsiders. But it isn't credible. Mr. Mbeki has had a chance to put into practice his pro-democracy sentiments by pressuring his neighbor, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, into respecting political, human and economic rights. But Mr. Mbeki has failed to intervene effectively while Zimbabwe's leader has stolen an election, tortured hundreds of opponents and expropriated private farms. Until Mr. Mbeki and other African leaders get serious about isolating Mr. Mugabe, it will be difficult to take the African Renaissance plan seriously. The second channel is an initiative to expand primary-school enrollment in poor countries. Two years ago the rich governments represented at the Canada summit promised to back developing nations that came forward with sound education policies. The World Bank, acting in consultation with donor governments, has reviewed a large number of proposals and judged 18 of them sound. But although the Bush administration deserves credit for keeping this initiative alive over the past 18 months, it appears disinclined to back it with cash. Other donor countries may prove more generous. But if the United States remains on the sidelines, an effort to help Africa that has taken two years to develop may now lose momentum. The third potential channel for helping Africa is trade. Last November the Bush administration helped to launch a new round of trade talks and gave it a pro-Africa twist: This new ""Development Round"" would focus on things that matter to Africans, such as cutting barriers to farm exports. But the administration then broke its halo by signing on to the huge jump in subsidies for domestic farmers -- subsidies that will boost production in the United States, so squeezing out exports from poor countries. The Japanese and Europeans practice outragreous farm protection too. But reformers in Brussels and Tokyo are having a hard time arguing for more open farm trade now that the United States has marched off in the opposite direction. Unfortunately, therefore, the summit in Canada is unlikely to help Africa much, though we'd be delighted to be proven wrong. Meanwhile in Washington, there is something that could make a difference. Congress needs to revive presidential trade promotion authority, which has passed both chambers but which has yet to go to conference. The chief obstacle is the refusal of Rep. Bill Thomas (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to accept reasonable Democratic proposals to help workers who lose jobs as a result of trade. Unless Mr. Thomas relents, he may lack the votes to get the trade measure through the House after the conference negotiations. The midterm elections are approaching, and time is running out. Mr. Thomas, a smart champion of trade, should not let his views on unemployment insurance become yet another obstacle to Africa's advancement."29-Dec-02,KENYA (99%); RWANDA (79%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%),"When Mwai Kibaki was injured in a car accident this month, he didn't seek treatment at his local hospital. He went to the airport and boarded a flight to London. Kibaki's injuries were relatively straightforward -- a broken arm and a sprained ankle -- but Kenyan hospitals just don't provide the level of medical care he wanted. His decision to go abroad was hardly unusual. Kenyans and foreigners who can afford to do so frequently travel to developed countries for health care. But Kibaki, 71, attracted more attention than most. He was running for president of Kenya, and his evacuation to Britain in the thick of the campaign was a stinging reminder of the painful lack of basic services in this East African nation of 30 million people. ""It's sad really,"" said Meshach Onguti, the new director of Kenyatta National Hospital, where overcrowding forces two and three patients to share a bed, and technology in the emergency room dates from around the late 1970s. ""Kibaki's decision to leave his own country for medical care, well, it's just this huge metaphor for the state of every service in this country."" Kenyan voters went to the polls on Friday for a watershed election that will end the 24-year rule of the loved, hated and omnipresent President Daniel arap Moi, who is barred under the constitution from running again. Partial results indicate that Kibaki's trip to London didn't hurt his candidacy a bit; the opposition leader appears headed for a landslide victory. If Kibaki indeed wins, he will inherit a seemingly endless list of problems to solve: not just inadequate health care, but a scarcity of jobs, a public education system in shambles and a shattered infrastructure of rocky roads, sporadic electricity and balky telephones. Some Kenyans wonder where he should begin; others say the answer is simple: End corruption. Nothing is blamed more frequently for the country's woes than rampant corruption and patronage. Kenyan political analysts say corruption is woven through every element of a society that has come to accept the inevitability of giving or getting ""a little something"" to get through each day. Kenyans regularly speak of being unable to get a job, proper hospital care, a driver's license, phone lines and even a chance to pay bills unless they bribe someone. ""Corruption is the key, really,"" said John Githongo local head of Transparency International, a corruption watchdog group with a special office in Nairobi. ""I mean, this country collects billions in taxes each year. And if you look at what the government does with it, it's not very much. ""We have in Kenya impunity towards corruption. Rwandans know genocide; we know corruption. And it has hurt us and held us back."" Under Moi, critics say, a system of patronage developed that favored a small percentage of the population -- police to teachers to the distant cousins of government ministers -- and provided nothing for the vast majority of Kenyans. For example, some blame the terrorist attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in 1998 and the Paradise Hotel in Mombasa last month on the fact that weapons can easily be smuggled into the country with a bribe. When phones don't work, the electricity goes out and roads become wracked with deep potholes, it is often the funds that are meant to maintain these services that get pocketed. It often takes a bribe to get a job or run a business. ""I tried to get a job. At one point I attempted to sell eggs. It all collapsed,"" said James Maato, 26, who has been unemployed for five years and sat listlessly at a city park one day recently. ""There was too much corruption. I couldn't get anything done. I had to hand out a bit of money, and I didn't have enough."" While few Kenyans question the importance of rooting out corruption, some are unsure if either Kibaki or his principal opponent, ruling party candidate Uhuru Kenyatta, is capable of doing it. ""They are going to have to clean up a big mess,"" said Sammy Wambua, a political analyst for the East African Standard, a major newspaper here. ""There [are] a lot of [people] at every level who will be working against them. It may take a very, very long time and a lot of desire to really do it."" Nevertheless, whoever wins will be under intense international pressure to commit to tackling the issue. Such international agencies as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are withholding hundreds of millions of dollars earmarked for Kenya until corruption is reined in. When the IMF suspended a $ 220 million loan in 1997, it said it was doing so because of ""absurd and arguably unnecessary donor rituals."" Leaders of Kibaki's National Rainbow Coalition have announced plans to form a national forgiveness and reconciliation team that would offer anyone charged with stealing money from the government a chance to avoid prosecution by giving the money back. They also said they would begin forming committees to combat corruption and patronage in the police department and the court system. ""Jobs will be given on merit,"" said Raila Odinga, an opposition leader. ""Jobs will no longer be given on the basis of someone's tribe or where they come from."" Kibaki has also said that if he wins the election, he will publicly declare his wealth -- something that Moi has never done. Watchdog groups have said Kibaki's idea could set a new tone toward stopping corruption in everyday life. The election campaign offered little hope, however, as candidates continued the practice of handing out money for what Kenyans commonly call ""our daily bread."" In the rural village of Mbeere, in the impoverished eastern section of the country, Kenyatta's sister gave out ""tea"" -- the euphemism for a bribe on Christmas Day. Families lined up for the equivalent of $ 2.50, in a country where most people live on a dollar a day. In response, the Daily Nation newspaper ran an editorial that warned Kenyans: ""Don't vote with your stomachs."" At Kenyatta National Hospital, examples of how corruption hurts every level of the institution's functions can be seen at every turn. Onguti, the new director, said he had to fire much of the staff for inefficiency and corruption. At the same time, the IMF has withheld health care funding since 2000 until the moribund Kenya anti-corruption authority resumes work. Both presidential candidates have said they would restore that unit. The hospital's bathrooms are dirty, with urine-stained floors and feces smeared across toilets, and nurses said they were told to pay for cleaning supplies with their own money. There is no MRI machine, and cancer patients have to wait three months or more for treatment because there isn't enough equipment. Conditions at other medical centers throughout the country are worse. In a country where 700 people die every day of an HIV-related illness, an HIV/AIDS clinic in Mombasa has only headache medicine and rubbing alcohol. ""The problem is, shall we say, misappropriation of funds and a lack of international money,"" said Ewoi Benguwn, a doctor at the Fatima Medical Clinic as she handed an aspirin to an AIDS patient. ""I mean, honestly, most doctors who work here won't get medical treatment in this country."" Editorial assistant Candice Miranda contributed to this report."30-Dec-02,KENYA (99%); AFRICA (92%); SUDAN (79%); ZAMBIA (79%); SOMALIA (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (71%),"Kenyan opposition leader Mwai Kibaki won the job of president today in a historic and peaceful vote heralded as this nation's first step toward ending authoritarian rule. It was a day of celebrations, with Kenyans dancing in the streets of the capital, Nairobi, and riding on trucks and waving branches -- a symbol of a new start -- as results showed that the four-decade dominance of President Daniel arap Moi's party had ended. ""This marks history,"" said Kibaki, wearing a brightly colored shirt and sitting in the garden of his posh home in Nairobi. ""This for me is a great job, and Kenyans have given me a great challenge."" Kibaki, 71, will be sworn in Monday as Kenya's third president since independence from Britain in 1963. He defeated Uhuru Kenyatta, 41, son of Kenya's venerated nationalist and first president, Jomo Kenyatta, and Moi's chosen protege. Kenyatta conceded defeat hours before the election results were released, saying: ""I accept the choice of the people that Kibaki will be the third president of this country. From those ashes a strong foundation will begin again."" Kibaki, an economist who has run for president twice before, promised to fight corruption in a nation where a system of patronage and bribes has damaged and depleted state institutions. The country ranks as one of the most corrupt in the world, according to watchdog groups. ""First and foremost we should start by tackling corruption,"" Kibaki said, adding that he and his top officials would release documents detailing their wealth when they take office. The smooth election defied widespread fears that it would be rigged, as voting was in 1992 and 1997. Election observers from the European Union and the Carter Center in the United States said the election sends an important message to other African nations, where transitions are often fragile and frequently lead to civil wars. ""This has a great bearing on Africa where there are neighboring countries suffering lack of peace in Somalia, Sudan and Congo,"" said Kenneth Kaunda, the former president of Zambia, who ran an election monitoring team. Kaunda was voted out of office in 1991 and retired peacefully. ""Kenyans have given us a good lesson which we must emulate."" The Electoral Commission of Kenya declared Kibaki and his National Rainbow Coalition the winner with 63 percent of the vote over Kenyatta's 30 percent. With results for 192 seats reported in the 210-seat legislature, the Rainbow alliance captured 122; Kenyatta's party, Kenya African National Union (KANU), won 52. Smaller parties won the remaining places. But the new political leaders face deep challenges. Many of the people in Kibaki's coalition defected just two months ago from Moi's party. Kibaki himself was Moi's vice president from 1978 to 1988 and was also the country's longest-serving finance minister, holding the post from 1969 to 1982. Some wonder if Kibaki's party -- hastily assembled primarily to fight Moi -- can stick together and enforce real change. Moi has ruled Kenya since 1978 and the system, analysts said, needs to be completely restructured.  But Kibaki's anti-corruption plans could lead to tension. ""There are no angels in parliament,"" said John Githongo, head of the Nairobi branch of Transparency International, a corruption watchdog group. ""There is a lot of euphoria right now. But civil society and vigilance cannot stop."" During Moi's rule, taking bribes and paying off government workers to obtain even small services such as parking became a daily part of life in Kenya. And Moi became larger than life: His picture is on the country's currency and hangs from the wall of nearly every store. Streets, schools and airports are named after him. And he instituted a national holiday: Moi Day. Kibaki said he is sincere about ending the government's authoritarian style and that governing ""is not a matter of promoting the ego of a president."" ""I think a president should prove himself by things that he does and if he changes the life of ordinary Kenyans then after he dies people can memorialize him, but not on every street and airport and nightclub."" The U.S. ambassador, Johnnie Carson, called the election ""historic for Africa."" ""What is happening here is an example of what can be done in other countries,"" Carson said. ""And it's extraordinarily important."" President Bush said he is looking forward to working with Kibaki. White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Bush also welcomed the fact that the elections were peaceful. ""The people of Kenya have chosen a new leader and all parties have acted responsibly in working to institutionalize democracy in Kenya,"" McClellan said. The elections have also brought enormous hope to Kenyans -- many of whom survive on $ 1 a day and live without electricity and running water. Bernard Ngoroge, 32, took his children to city hall to witness the change of power. ""This is Kenyan history,"" said Ngoroge, watching the crowds cheering and dancing in the streets. ""I want them to see this and remember that this is a very joyful day for Kenyans."" Many Kenyans said they hoped they would no longer have to pay bribes now that Moi was gone. Crowds took to Moi Avenue outside of city hall and sang to police officers in Swahili, ""No More Kitu Kidogo,"" a phrase meaning ""a little something."" ""We have wandered in the desert for 40 years of KANU, and for 40 years Kenyans have suffered,"" said Milka Opondo, 38, a mother of two. ""Now we are free. Now we have a real democracy."""31-Dec-02,KENYA (98%); AFRICA (91%),"Few presidents have started their terms with higher public expectations than Mwai Kibaki, elected on Saturday and inaugurated yesterday as president of a jubilant and startled Kenya. Kenyans are coming to terms with the fact that their autocratic leader, Daniel arap Moi, has allowed a free election, saw his chosen successor defeated and permitted the challenger to take office. For this Mr. Moi deserves credit -- but for little else. He is one of Africa's Big Men, who put his face on the currency and demanded songs of praise from his people. In 24 years in power he has presided over exploding corruption, promoted tribal division, permitted economic decline and corroded democratic institutions. Mr. Moi has left behind many more problems than President Kibaki will be able to solve. But if he chooses his battles wisely -- and from early comments, it seems he has -- Mr. Kibaki, a respected economist considered uncorrupted, can do much to rebuild Kenya. Kenya will be a much happier place if Mr. Kibaki simply refrains from Mr. Moi's mischief, such as fomenting ethnic violence and persecuting the opposition. Presidents rarely seek to reduce their powers, but Mr. Kibaki should be the exception. A well-regarded commission will soon release ideas for reform, likely to include reducing presidential powers. Mr. Kibaki should follow the recommendations. Mr. Kibaki has rightly made eliminating fees for primary school and improving health care his top projects. Combating corruption, the reform perhaps most desired by Kenyans, is his other priority. Kenyans pay a bribe every two days, according to a recent survey. This has driven away foreign investment. Nearly $1 billion in international aid has been frozen because the country failed to pass anti-corruption legislation and because Mr. Moi obstructed the work of anti-corruption commissions. While fighting corruption is notoriously difficult, Mr. Kibaki can set a new tone. His announcement that his ministers will have to declare their wealth is a good, if largely symbolic, start. Because Mr. Moi's machinery is still very much in power, the new president is fudging the question of how to treat past crimes. Mr. Kibaki could investigate tribal clashes that killed hundreds of people, apparently with the complicity of high-level government officials. Prosecutions might be relatively safe because Mr. Moi ordered the first inquiry, though he kept the results secret for years. Mr. Kibaki might also be able to prosecute the players in Kenya's most notorious corruption scandal, who could possibly include Mr. Moi. The new president may be tempted to reward his predecessor for holding elections, but he should not be. Serious crimes were committed by members of the Moi government. Justice, at least for the worst of them, is part of restoring the rule of law to Kenya."4-Jul-03,KENYA (79%),"Once upon a time, World Bank financiers viewed their mission in narrow terms: Lend money to poor countries to try to make them richer. The governments that borrowed the money might let a bribe determine who was awarded a contract, and money intended for new highways or hospitals was sometimes siphoned off for other purposes, such as buying weapons. But overall, bank officials said, a little bit of corruption was tolerable -- often necessary -- to make economic development work. They don't say that anymore. Responding to evidence that corruption impedes the progress of failing economies, the World Bank in the late 1990s began cracking down on the corrupt practices of its borrowers. ""The one thing I'm proudest of is our work on corruption,"" bank President James D. Wolfensohn said recently. Before he took office in 1995, Wolfensohn said, the bank considered corruption ""an issue of politics,"" as opposed to one of economic development. Now, ""it is now central to what we do."" Under Wolfensohn, the bank began participating in international efforts to fight corruption. It developed internal controls to audit its projects. It compiled a blacklist of nearly 100 companies and individuals banned from receiving bank-funded contracts because of bribery, theft or for breaking other rules. Since 1996, the bank has started more than 600 anti-corruption programs in nearly 100 countries, according to a published statement. Some observers of the World Bank -- which reported that it lent $ 19.5 billion of dollars in the year ended June 30, 2002 -- say it should be doing more to discourage the governments and companies it works with from misusing its money, which comes mostly from the governments of rich countries. The bank has continued to fund projects in countries where corruption is said to be rampant, such as Bangladesh. Only one country, Kenya, has been prohibited from receiving bank loans because of its government's corrupt practices, and that was temporary. Despite the blacklist, the bank sometimes has been reluctant to ban companies that violate its rules. Because many of the world's most corrupt countries are also among the poorest, the bank's new stance can force difficult choices between continuing aid to a country that needs it and cutting it to discourage corruption. Poor countries are also notoriously poor record-keepers, making auditing more difficult. ""No one says this is easy. It's a trade-off,"" said Peter Eigen, founder and president of Transparency International, a corruption watchdog group. ""You can't just have a simplistic link between the level of corruption and the level of funding. Some of these countries would really struggle without the bank's loans."" Eigen, who left the World Bank in 1991 when his pleas for a stronger anti-corruption stance were ignored, said he believes that under Wolfensohn the bank has made fighting corruption a priority. ""It's very hard to change a large organization like the World Bank, and they're still working through this,"" Eigen said. ""They were pretty bad, and allowed [corruption] to become a major problem. There's been a total change in policy, but to change from policy to total implementation is a long way to go. While I'd be hard pressed to say they've licked it, they are an enthusiastic and effective partner."" The U.S. General Accounting Office evaluated the bank's anti-corruption efforts and gave a mixed review in a June report. While it found that the bank had taken ""important steps"" toward reducing internal corruption, the agency also recommended further action, including a more extensive audit of whether the bank's loans are used for their intended purposes. The bank ""has a long way to go,"" said William Easterly, an economics professor at New York University. ""If the client is important enough geostrategically or one they want to cultivate in the long run, they will continue lending to them, despite long histories of corruption. They continue forcing loans down that pipe."" Corruption can take many forms, but it is usually defined as the misuse of public office or money for private gain. In the 1980s and early 1990s, most academic literature on economic development argued that corruption could help ""grease the wheels"" of a fledgling economy. But after several studies showed that corruption impedes development, many foreign aid programs began advocating ""zero tolerance"" toward corruption. The World Bank responded to the shifting conventional wisdom. Soon after Wolfensohn railed against the ""cancer of corruption"" at the bank's 1996 annual meeting in Hong Kong, the bank formed an investigative body to audit its loans and set up a 24-hour hotline to allow staff and members of the public to report allegations of corruption. In November 1998 the bank convened a ""sanctions committee"" to punish companies and individuals guilty of corruption. In 2000 it formed a ""department of institutional integrity"" to investigate allegations of corruption within the bank or in connection with bank-funded contracts. It also started working with anti-corruption groups that once were highly critical of its activities. With Transparency International, the bank supports anti-corruption efforts such as an initiative to better account for money lent to countries involved in military conflicts. To combat corruption, the bank can ban, or ""debar,"" companies that use bribes and other unethical means to secure contracts, or it can directly punish governments by denying or decreasing loans to those where corruption is rampant. World Bank officials cited a recent audit of an urban development project in Sulawesi, Indonesia, as an example of a successful crackdown on companies. A 2002 review of the project -- for which the bank provided money to improve water services, housing, sanitation, flood control, roads and transportation on the remote Indonesian island -- found widespread corruption in procurement. In April of this year, the bank debarred 15 Indonesian companies for various lengths of time. The bank has permanently debarred 93 companies, but provides no information about them beyond their names and where they are based. The list includes four local firms. Asia Construction, which the blacklist says is located in Delaware and Maryland, is out of business. Two other companies, Digidata and Knowledge Engineering, both of Virginia, are owned by David Riper, of Fairfax, whose name also appears on the bank's blacklist. He was accused of paying a kickback to a bank official to help secure a contract on a project in Nairobi. Riper declined a request for comment. One Washington company, International Access Corp., is debarred until 2004. An attorney for the company said in a prepared statement that the firm ""was not treated fairly"" by the bank but did not address the reasons for the bank's decision. Despite the lengthy list of banned companies, several critics say that simply targeting firms that don't follow the rules is not enough. ""The view of most economists is that all the money is really going into one pot,"" Easterly said. ""The government might refrain from stealing funds on a World Bank project, but compensate by stealing more from another project."" Instead, Easterly advocates cutting off countries whose governments have demonstrable corruption problems. In June, the bank announced that Kenya, an East African country making a difficult transition to democracy after decades of one-party rule, was approved for a new loan of more than $ 100 million. In the past decade, Kenya has temporarily been cut off from funding by the World Bank and its affiliate lending organization, the International Monetary Fund, because of widespread political corruption. As recently as May, a government official there was accused of taking a $ 100,000 bribe from a contractor in the Kenya Urban Transport Initiative Program, a bank project that was suspended in August 2002 because of charges of rampant bribery and embezzlement. In approving the recent loan, the bank cited several steps Kenya's new government took to combat corruption. Meanwhile, the bank continues to increase its lending to Bangladesh, a poor and densely populated South Asian country plagued by debilitating floods, which consistently ranks near the top of world corruption surveys. It is due to receive $ 554 million from the World Bank this year, and roughly the same amount next year, said Enrique Pantoja, a World Bank country officer for Bangladesh. The country's loan package for the previous three years averaged around $ 250 million a year, he said. ""Not all poor countries are equally corrupt,"" Easterly said. ""Why can't they do better at lending to those that do better?"" Other development experts point out that the level of corruption in a country is difficult to define and to quantify. Transparency International's index, which ranked Bangladesh as the most corrupt country in the world for 2002, measures the international community's ""perception"" of corrupt practices, which some say can be misleading. ""Bangladesh is actually a tricky case,"" said Steven Radelet, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development. ""The Transparency number has a few asterisks. It's based on fewer sources than the others. This is not Zimbabwe, not Nigeria. It's not a disaster, or a kleptocracy. They've made progress in a number of other areas like health care and family planning. So they're getting a big check this year. It's a judgment call."" Transparency International's Eigen said: ""Sometimes when companies start to take corruption seriously, more cases are uncovered. It gives the impression that they are more corrupt when they are actually doing better. The bank seems to be handling these cases well."" Anti-corruption advocates said they will be watching closely what has, up until now, been the most widely publicized case of corruption in a bank-funded project: the Highlands Water Project, a dam and power plant built in the late 1990s in Lesotho, a tiny mountain kingdom in southern Africa. Government authorities there charged several companies with various forms of corruption, including paying bribes to win contracts. The World Bank debarred several of the smaller firms involved, but one large multinational corporation, Acres International of Canada -- which in 2002 was found guilty of paying a $ 266,000 bribe to the project's head -- has not been punished so far. ""We are continuing to get legal advice on that,"" Wolfensohn said. ""It is still under review."" Staff writer Paul Blustein contributed to this report."10-Jul-03,KENYA (95%); AFRICA (94%),"The Neema Children's Center has disappeared into thin air, authorities here say, and so have other groups that claim to be fighting AIDS in this African capital. Neema, which means blessing in Swahili, last year presented the government a slick grant request outlining its work in helping AIDS orphans. There are an estimated 11 million children across Africa -- including a million in Kenya -- who have lost their parents to the disease. Many of them have been abandoned. Neema won about $14,000 from Kenya's National Aids Control Council, the body that coordinates the government's anti-AIDS campaign. The money came from a World Bank grant intended to finance grass-roots work on AIDS. But auditors for the council recently cut off funds to Neema after failing to find a single orphan who had benefited from its work. ""We could not identify any orphan who received anything,"" said Kassim Mambo, a spokesman for the control council. ""We couldn't find anyone who worked for Neema either."" As the death toll from AIDS mounts, more and more money is arriving from overseas to combat the disease. President Bush is touting his administration's three-year pledge of $15 billion in AIDS spending in a tour of Africa this week, and AIDS activists say that still more is needed to combat the epidemic. The money that is arriving, however, is more than sufficient to attract the attention of unscrupulous operators. Across Africa, fake AIDS charities, which often lack offices or phones, have sprung up. Experts say the impostors illustrate that while money is desperately needed to fight AIDS, so are programs to combat corruption and stimulate African economies. Fraudulent entrepreneurs must be offered more productive ways of making a living in AIDS-affected countries, they say, than deceiving the sick. ""Ever since AIDS arrived on the scene, we've had all manner of people, some with no professional expertise, trying to elbow in on the pandemic,"" said Frances Angila, the head of Kenya's oversight group for nongovernmental organizations. ""The potential for fly-by-night organizations is very high. Sometimes it is a man and wife. Sometimes it's a few cronies who had a beer in a pub and decided that having an AIDS organization would be a good thing."" Kenya's AIDS oversight body recently stopped financing four such groups, including Neema, although none of the organizers have been apprehended. Another 10 are under investigation. In addition, the government recently suspended several hundred more nongovernmental organizations that did not properly document their spending. Several dozen of the suspended groups focused on AIDS. Experts say the bad apples represent only a small percentage of the 680 AIDS-related nongovernmental organizations in Kenya and of the hundreds of other community-based organizations working to combat the disease. ""I feel hurt when I see money going to people who don't have any actual work at all,"" said David Sira, who founded Kenya Aids and Drugs Alliance in 2001. His group employs five people and works across the country. Mr. Sira said he has AIDS and understands how hard everyday life can be for those who suffer from it. ""I decided to educate people to reduce the stigma,"" he said. ""I personally was close to committing suicide because of how I was treated."" Not only are mom-and-pop operations accused of misspending. Kenya's National AIDS Control Council, which finances the country's AIDS fight, has itself been accused of mishandling funds marked for the disease. The anticorruption unit of the Kenya police is currently investigating the group to determine whether it misspent $250,000 during the observance of World AIDS Day in 2001. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which is doling out huge amounts across the developing world, still granted Kenya's government $37 million recently for its AIDS fight. Some of the money will go to the control council. But Jerry van Mourick, the regional representative of the global fund, said he has pressed Kenyan officials to track the money closely. ""We don't just write blank checks,"" Mr. van Mourick said in a telephone interview from Tanzania, where he was negotiating a $5.3 million AIDS grant. ""A very important principle of the global fund is we need some assurance that the grant monies are properly spent."" The change in political leadership in Kenya is giving him and other donors some hope of increased oversight. Mwai Kibaki became president in December, replacing Daniel arap Moi, who was president for 24 years and is said to have left office while the country was riddled with corruption. Mr. Kibaki has begun an anti-corruption crackdown which has, among other things, led to the investigation of AIDS spending. Mr. Mambo, the spokesman for Kenya's AIDS control council, disputes allegations that most of the money the council receives goes to staff salaries. In the last year, about 800 organizations have received funds, he said, on the basis of endorsements by community leaders. Only a handful, he said, were fraudulent. ""If some of the organizations are nonexistent or are not doing the work they were funded to do, NACC would be glad to receive those reports, and immediate action would be taken,"" Mr. Mambo said in a statement he prepared in defense of the National AIDS Control Council. Kenya's health minister, Charity K. Ngulu, who has led the fight against AIDS fraud, accused the control council of squandering millions of dollars through shoddy accounting and questionable contracting procedures. There appears to be a political dimension to her attacks because she is said to be seeking to have control of the council, now part of the president's office, transferred to the health ministry. But Ms. Ngulu insists that her campaign is about disease prevention, not increasing her fiefdom. No more contracts ought to be awarded, she said, to what she calls briefcase nongovernmental organizations, which operate out of some shady character's attache case."15-Dec-03,KENYA (94%); ZAMBIA (93%); NICARAGUA (93%); AFRICA (92%),"Former presidents of small, corrupt nations do not, lamentably, have many bad weeks. But last week was one of them. Nicaragua's former president, Arnoldo Aleman, was given a 20-year jail term for corruption. And in Zambia, the corruption trial of Frederick Chiluba began -- a rare attemptin Africa to prosecute a former head of state for a crime that is all too endemic. These trials are a giant step forward. But they are not, in themselves, an anti-corruption program, and can even get in the way of fighting graft because they can eat up all the money budgeted for it. While trying one's predecessor is a dramatic way to show that things have changed, it can also be a convenient way to dispose of a rival. Moreover, it affects very few people. The police officer shaking down drivers or the bureaucrat demanding a cut of a government contract may not be deterred by seeing a former president on trial. The solution is not to abandon prosecutions, but to work to prevent corruption. This requires resolve, but if the political will is there, effective reforms are simple. Many countries have cleaned up government contracting by establishing Internet bidding, with the winning offers made public. A driver's license bureau that clearly posts the required documents and the steps in the process gives officials less opportunity to extort. If public servants must declare their wealth annually, and can be fired if caught lying, they are deterred from buying a Mercedes or a beach house. Kenya's new president, Mwai Kibaki, has used Kenyans' fury about corruption to build support for purges of corrupt judges and laws that increase transparency and require public servants to declare their wealth. Although Daniel arap Moi, who ruled Kenya from 1978 until last year, is widely accused of corruption, he is not on trial. President Kibaki says he may ask the judiciary to try Mr. Moi, but not until the courts are cleaner. His attempt to change the system is more difficult than tossing his predecessor in the dock. But it is also more successful -- Kenyans used to daily shakedowns are already seeing a change for the better."21-Jan-04,NIGERIA (95%); FRANCE (94%); UNITED STATES (79%); NIGER (79%),"A French judge is investigating allegations that a subsidiary of Halliburton Co. and a French firm were involved in millions of dollars in illegal payments during the late 1990s in connection with a contract for a Nigerian natural gas facility, according to judicial sources and French media reports. The  probe is looking at Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR), the Halliburton subsidiary, along with the French engineering company Technip, KBR's partner in the project on Nigeria's Bonny Island in the eastern Niger River delta, according to media reports citing French judicial sources. Halliburton spokeswoman Wendy Hall declined comment Friday, except to say that Halliburton had not been contacted by French authorities. In a Dec. 23 statement, Technip said that a probe was opened in October regarding contracts for a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility in Nigeria. The statement said ""it is not accurate to say that this investigation is targeting Technip and/or KBR."" The investigation has been opened against ""unnamed persons,"" it said. ""It is also incorrect to make references to 'secret payments,' "" the statement said. ""All supplier payments made by the . . . joint venture in relation to the Nigerian LNG project have been the subject of standard supplier contracts and have been consistently registered"" in the joint venture's books, it said. An e-mail sent Tuesday by the Technips press office said; ""There is no additional statement from Technip since our press release dated Dec. 23, 2003, and we don't wish to make any further comment."" The Paris prosecutor launched a preliminary probe of the Nigerian payments in October 2002, according to sources familiar with the case. In June 2003, the prosecutor found enough merit in the case to assign it to an investigating anti-corruption judge, Renaud van Ruymbeke, who opened a formal investigation in October, the sources said. Halliburton was headed by Vice President Cheney from 1995 until he was chosen as President Bush's running mate in 2000, and the payments would have been made during his tenure at the company. French prosecutors are basing their investigation at least in part on a 1997 international convention, approved by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, that allows for the cross-border prosecution of public corruption cases regardless of where the corruption occurred or where the targeted firm is headquartered. The United States was a strong backer of that anti-corruption convention, and it became part of French law in 2000. Officials in Van Ruymbeke's office said they had no public comment to make on any ongoing investigation. According to the French newspaper Le Figaro, investigators are looking into whether the joint venture made a series of payments totaling $180 million into a number of offshore bank accounts, using another company based in Gibraltar as a go-between. The newspaper accounts said that at the heart of the investigation is the question of whether those payments amounted to illegal commissions, or bribes, to Nigerian public officials. Special correspondent Pan Yuk in Paris contributed to this report."2-Apr-04,EQUATORIAL GUINEA (94%); UNITED STATES (94%); SAUDI ARABIA (93%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%),"Federal banking and law enforcement authorities may fine Riggs Bank N.A., as well as officers and directors of the Washington institution, for allegedly failing to live up to a July agreement to improve its anti-money-laundering procedures, according to securities filings. An investigation, which focused on Riggs's longtime relationships with the diplomatic community in Washington, led the bank to cut ties to one of its largest customers -- the Saudi Arabian Embassy and that country's ambassador, Prince Bandar bin Sultan -- and the tiny African country of Equatorial Guinea and its dictator. In recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Riggs said the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network told bank officials on March 2 that regulators were considering fining the bank for failing to comply with the agreement Riggs signed last summer to adhere to the Bank Secrecy Act. That law requires banks to report any deposit or withdrawal of more than $10,000, or any other suspicious activity, to regulators. Riggs said the OCC and law enforcement authorities are ""reviewing the involvement of employees, officers, and directors."" Mark Hendrix, spokesman for Riggs, said the bank has taken the matter seriously and worked closely with regulators to improve its compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act. When asked whether the bank or its directors might face civil penalties, Hendrix said: ""Riggs Bank, its board of directors and its employees would never knowingly violate . . . regulatory laws."" ""Riggs has never acted willfully in violation of the BSA or other laws,"" Hendrix said in a statement. ""We have taken and continue to take proactive and decisive steps to reduce risk."" Last month, Riggs decided to terminate its relationship with the Saudi Arabian Embassy, the ambassador and his family, a knowledgeable source who spoke on condition of anonymity said. The bank is in the process of closing those accounts, which are worth tens of millions of dollars, because of a series of suspicious deposits and withdrawals since January. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the Saudi relationship, one of Riggs's oldest and biggest accounts, had ended. In late February, according to a Riggs securities filing, the bank informed a large customer it was ""terminating its depositary relationship."" A source who has been briefed on the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity said the relationship was with officials of Equatorial Guinea, a destitute but oil-rich sub-Saharan African country, including its president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema. Human rights and anti-corruption groups have charged Obiang with profiting from his country's vast oil wealth while Equatorial Guinea's citizens remain among the poorest in the world. Equatorial Guinea officials could not be reached for comment. In a written statement, Exxon Mobil Corp. said the oil company's affiliate in Equatorial Guinea has made ""payments in U.S. dollars to an account of the General Treasury of Equatorial Guinea at the Riggs Bank in Washington, D.C. for required tax and legal obligations in that country. These payments are made as required under our contracts with the government of Equatorial Guinea."" When Riggs terminated the account, Equatorial Guinea had about $360 million, or 8 percent of its total deposits, at the bank. Though the amount was unusually large, Riggs said it had sufficient cash to cover the withdrawal. Hendrix said he could not comment on any depositor relationship. Scrutiny of Riggs's international business began with an FBI investigation initiated in 2002 of charitable contributions made by Saudi Princess Haifa al-Faisal with checks drawn on her Riggs account that may have indirectly benefited two of the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers. Upon reviewing the banking activity of the princess -- the wife of the current Saudi ambassador to the United States -- the FBI discovered the Saudi's account had about $36 million in withdrawals that were not reported to bank regulators -- $19 million in 2001 and $17 million in 2002, sources who have been briefed on the matter said. Hendrix, while declining to comment on the Saudi matter, said Riggs has had no indication it is a target of an FBI investigation. OCC officials and the FBI declined to comment. Saudi Embassy officials did not return phone calls. The OCC has designated Riggs a ""troubled institution,"" a regulatory designation that requires prior regulatory approval for a variety of actions, prohibits large severance payments to bank officers, and subjects the bank to more intense examinations, according to a source who has been briefed on the situation and spoke on condition of anonymity. Hendrix said that the bank's regulatory problems are related primarily to its compliance with the Bank Security Act and that Riggs remains well-capitalized. ""Riggs is financially strong,"" he said. The regulatory scrutiny is casting Riggs's prestigious international banking relationships in a riskier light. Riggs has long held most of the embassy business in Washington, a business that also puts it in a position to be the personal U.S. banker of diplomats and other foreign officials. Until recently, that business has been a lucrative one for Riggs. According to Riggs's annual report to the SEC, its international business lost $3 million in 2003, compared with a $1.2 million profit in 2002. The size of its international business has been shrinking as well, from $849 million in assets in 2001 to $675 million in assets in 2003. Riggs officials said the bank spent $3.9 million in 2003 on consultants to help it comply with the Bank Secrecy Act. Hendrix said the bank has retained consultants to improve compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and hired a new director of compliance and security to spearhead the bank's efforts. Riggs has also hired a team of former senior Secret Service agents who specialized in money laundering. Riggs, with $6.4 billion in assets, is controlled by Joseph L. Allbritton and run by his 34-year-old son, Robert L. Allbritton. Robert Allbritton, since becoming chief executive three years ago, has initiated a number of changes to try to boost profits, including improved technology and layoffs. He has tried to attract a high-net-worth clientele with investment advisory and other high-end services, while streamlining and improving its local retail banking operation. High expenses and sluggish loan growth led Riggs's parent company to earn just under $1 million in 2003, down from $13 million in 2002. Through more than 20 years of control by the Allbrittons, the bank has remained independent while most local banks its size have been sold to larger institutions. One analyst said the recent regulatory flare-up may be the impetus for the company's board of directors to seek a buyer. Riggs stock closed down 12 cents yesterday, at $17.10, but has been on the rise since early February and is near its 52-week high. Henry J. Coffey Jr., bank analyst at Ferris, Baker Watts Inc., said the increase is based on ""pure speculation"" that the controversy may force Riggs to sell. ""They've put the infrastructure in place to deal with the issues at hand,"" Coffey said. ""The question is, in the face of this is, do you sell the bank? That's about the only questions we ask with Riggs."" Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group Inc. senior analyst Gary B. Townsend said a buyer may be reluctant to take on Riggs until the full extent of the regulatory problems are known. ""One problem stemming from this is that the embassy business . . . is their most profitable business,"" Townsend said. ""If they should lose deposits and such as a consequence of this, it will have further profitability problems."""9-Oct-04,KENYA (97%); AFRICA (94%); UNITED STATES (79%),"Wangari Maathai, a Kenyan activist who founded an Africa-wide movement that empowered women, confronted corrupt officials and planted millions of trees in ravaged forestland, will receive the Nobel Peace Prize for 2004, the Nobel Committee announced Friday in Oslo. Maathai, the first African woman to win the prize, is known as ""Kenya's Green Militant."" She has championed the environment for more than 30 years on a continent where many people live close to nature but find it under increasing pressure from development, pollution and war. ""We have added a new dimension to the concept of peace,"" said Ole Danbolt Mjoes, head of the Nobel Committee, which makes its decisions in secrecy. ""We have emphasized the environment, democracy building and human rights, and especially women's rights."" An American-educated biologist, Maathai founded the Green Belt Movement in 1977, when she planted nine tree seeds in the yard of her house. In ensuing years, she and her movement succeeded in persuading women across Africa to do the same to fight the deforestation that is afflicting much of the continent. Trees help farmers by soaking up rain and preserving nutrient-rich topsoil; they also are a crucial habitat for wildlife. Her group worked closely with village women, whose traditional duties include collecting firewood. By the millions, they were won over to the idea that planting trees and protecting the environment in other ways would help farming and long-term development of their communities and ensure a supply of wood. Over almost three decades, the movement has brought about the planting of 30 million trees and given jobs to nearly 10,000 women who plant and sell seedlings to make a living. It was one of Africa's first female activist groups and has become a force in community affairs on a wide variety of issues. ""I feel so very excited, and I am very happy and very appreciative of all those who walked the road with me,"" Maathai, 64, said in a telephone interview. ""Many wars we witness around the world are over natural resources. Without a properly managed environment, all of our lives are threatened."" Daniel arap Moi, who ruled Kenya as president for two decades, once called Maathai a ""mad woman,"" and ""a threat to the order and security of the country"" for her tireless agitation to preserve forests. Moi's party lost a presidential election in 2002; Maathai was elected to parliament that year and is now assistant environment minister. Maathai said in the interview that she survived critics by having ""the thick skin of an elephant."" The tall and velvet-voiced Maathai joins past laureates who include former president Jimmy Carter, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, Mother Teresa, Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama and Martin Luther King Jr. She will receive the award in Oslo on Dec. 10. But on Friday, she celebrated by removing her jewelry, kneeling in the dirt and planting seeds of a Kenyan tree known as the Nandi Flame on the grounds of the Outspan Hotel in Nyeri, her home area in the foothills of Mount Kenya. President Mwai Kibaki hosted her at the Nairobi State House on Friday evening for a celebration. ""Prof. Maathai has waged a sustained campaign to protect our environment,"" Kibaki said in a statement. ""As Kenyans we must re-dedicate ourselves to the fight to conserve the environment as a gesture of appreciation of the prestigious award to one of our own."" Her efforts were not always cherished. In 1989, she led a one-woman charge in court against Moi's autocratic government, after he proposed building the tallest skyscraper in Africa and a six-story statue of himself in the only public green space in Kenya's gritty capital. ""She was threatened physically and was called a busybody in the press, yet she didn't flinch,"" said Mwalimu Mati, deputy directory of Transparency International, an anti-corruption group with offices in Nairobi. ""It was like watching a lone, unknown voice stand up against the whole. She really deserves this, because she's converted a lot of us to understand why the environment is so important. Now she has the real moral authority to challenge people who are selfishly allocating themselves land."" She was famous at the time for saying publicly, ""We can provide parks for rhino and elephants; why can't we provide open spaces for the people? Why are we creating environmental havoc in urban areas?"" A lawsuit she filed against the $200 million, Moi-backed project was dismissed. But by then, her protests had scared away investors. In 1992, she and other women stripped naked in downtown Nairobi to protest police abuses. She said that in taking off their clothes, the women had ""resorted to something they knew traditionally would act on the men. . . . They stripped to show their nakedness to their sons. It is a curse to see your mother naked."" On Jan. 8, 1999, she was whipped on the head and arrested by security forces allegedly hired by Moi to disperse Green Belt Movement members who were protesting the clearing of Karura Forest near Nairobi for a luxury housing development. She caught the nation's attention by insisting on signing her police report in blood from her head injury. The houses were never built. She is also a rare African feminist, whose husband left her in a nasty public divorce. He won the settlement dispute on the basis that she was, by her own account, ""too educated, too strong, too successful, too stubborn and too hard to control."" She has been a passionate fighter for women's rights, leading by example on a continent where women often live as second-class citizens, do most of the labor, but have the legal rights of children. Their rights to own property, for instance, are often limited. Maathai grew up in a Kenyan village, the daughter of farmers. She excelled at the local school and applied repeatedly for scholarships to continue her education, eventually winning one to attend college in the United States. In 1964, she received a degree in biological sciences from Mount St. Scholastica College in Atchison, Kan. She received a master's degree two years later from the University of Pittsburgh and, in 1971, a PhD from the University of Nairobi. That made her the first woman in eastern and central Africa to earn a doctorate. She also became the first female professor at the University of Nairobi. At times, she has generated jealousy among her peers. ""I have had the fortune of breaking a lot of records,"" Maathai said in a 1992 interview with The Washington Post. ""First woman this. First woman that. And I think that created a lot of jealousy without me realizing. Sometimes we don't quite realize that not everybody's clapping when we're succeeding."" David Makali, director of Nairobi's Media Institute, said he hoped Maathai's newfound global fame would draw attention to a current land-grab controversy in Kenya. Top government officials, including Moi and another former president, Jomo Kenyatta, are accused of seizing public lands for their personal use and arranging the clearing of trees for fast profits. The award ""is fabulous news . . . for Kenya and Africa,"" Makali said. ""This will increase the visibility of the country and our campaign to be better watchdogs over our country's land."" Last week, Maathai threatened to give up her seat in parliament to protest a plan to use forestland for small-scale farming. ""I would rather give up my seat than see our forests destroyed,"" she said Friday. She added that, prize or no prize, she would continue her fight, for the sake of young Africans. ""The generation that destroys the environment is usually not the generation that suffers,"" she said. ""If they go into the forest, they will be digging their own graves and that of their children and grandchildren."""13-Feb-05,KENYA (99%); UNITED STATES (79%); AFRICA (79%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%),"Kenya's new government awarded a $34 million contract to a foreign firm for a new passport and visa system to prevent attacks such as the 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. But in what became known as the ""Anglo-Leasing scandal,"" top members of the president's office were accused last year of pocketing the money. In August, the director of the National AIDS Control Council, Margaret Gachara, was found guilty of defrauding the government of $340,000. She spent time in jail, but the president pardoned her in December, along with 7,000 ""petty offenders"" who had stolen from various government offices. The cases are just two of those that were under investigation by John Githongo, the country's anti-corruption czar who was appointed by President Mwai Kibaki when he was elected in 2002. Kibaki, the leader of an opposition coalition, promised to end the system of corruption and patronage that had eaten away at government institutions during the 24-year reign of Daniel arap Moi. But on Monday, Githongo quit his post, faxing his resignation from the Kenyan Embassy in London. Githongo had grown frustrated with what he saw as an inability to do his job as his focus shifted from investigating past corruption cases to examining allegations against members of Kibaki's administration, according to a coalition of civic leaders that issued statements on his behalf. Githongo made powerful enemies, the coalition said, and his life had reportedly been threatened. Githongo has not spoken publicly about his decision to quit. Until Kibaki tapped him to lead Kenya's anti-graft agencies shortly after he was elected, Githongo had been the energetic head of the Kenyan branch of Transparency International, a global anti-corruption watchdog group. Many Kenyans viewed his appointment as a serious government commitment to ending the culture of corruption. Posters of a cartoon rendering of Githongo, glasses pushed close to his round face and a pointed finger warning against offering and accepting bribes, were put up across Nairobi, the capital. He earned respect for saying that bad leadership had ""turned every Kenyan into a thief"" and urging citizens to hold the government accountable and change the culture themselves. His resignation symbolizes a loss of confidence in an administration that many looked to for change, and reflects the frustration of Kenyans already skeptical of the government's commitment. ""The government has been insulting the intelligence of Kenyans,"" said Gladwell Otieno, who succeeded Githongo as head of Transparency International in Kenya, which has been asking the government to guarantee Githongo's safety if he returns to the country. ""Any attempts to deal with endemic corruption requires reengineering the entire way the country is run. And obviously this is not happening any longer,"" he said. Kenya has the largest economy in East Africa. With cool, sunny, California-like weather, lush green hillsides of mango and banana trees and plentiful wildlife, the country is a favorite safari destination for Americans and Europeans. But most citizens can barely afford their tea and daily bread. International donors estimate that up to $1 billion has disappeared since 2002, nearly a fifth of the nation's budget for 2004. The result can be seen in everyday life. The roads are crumbling, and if they are repaired, jobless men begging for change do the work, filling potholes with dirt. Squalid hospitals are drastically under funded, with cancer patients forced to wait months for chemotherapy. Bribes are required to get services such as running water in homes, and large-scale corruption sometimes causes school and road projects to be abandoned. ""Corruption in Kenya isn't a matter of Kitu Kidogo, or of a few ministers skimming off commission,"" said the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, William M. Bellamy, referring to a common Swahili phrase that means ""give me something small."" ""It is big enough to cause macroeconomic distortions. Every Kenyan laboring to feed his family, educate his children, care for a family member suffering from AIDS or simply avoid getting hacked to death in the mounting wave of violence sweeping this country is a victim of today's corruption, and they know it,"" Bellamy said.On Tuesday, a day after Githongo resigned, the United States suspended $2.5 million in funding for anti-corruption work in Kenya. Bellamy, during a meeting in Nairobi with British businessmen, said the amount lost to corruption could fund antiretroviral treatments for every HIV-positive Kenyan for 10 years. On Wednesday, the European Union and Japan warned that corruption must be tackled, saying they would withdraw aid if improvements were not made.The British High Commissioner to Kenya, Edward Clay, has said the government has lost millions of dollars since it came to power. In July, he accused the government of ""arrogance, greed and perhaps a desperate sense of panic to lead them to eat like gluttons.""Kenya's foreign minister, Chirau Ali Mwakwere, called Clay an ""incorrigible liar"" and suggested that he had drunk ""one too many"" before he delivered a speech last week.Justice Minister Kiraitu Murungi said the U.S. decision to freeze assets was like ""like raping a woman who is already too willing,"" meaning the government already wanted to end corruption.But that reaction backfired with protests from women's rights activists. Women stormed his office this past week, saying he was trivializing rape. He later apologized.The international criticism of Kenyan corruption has pleased ordinary citizens. Radio and television broadcasts in recent days have been filled with angry comments. ""The government has no respect for the Kenyans they serve,"" yelled Javen Nyatuka, 38, a taxi driver. ""Our government should bite the bullet while the sun still shines and resign."""5-Mar-05,KENYA (79%),"After decades of denial, development experts and policymakers have finally acknowledged that corruption is a major impediment to development, perpetuating poverty for millions. With reforms barely underway, we are ill-served by Moises Naim's argument [op-ed, Feb. 20] that the ""corruption obsession"" is crowding out debate on other crucial problems, such as ""a country's bankrupt educational system, malfunctioning hospitals or stagnating economy."" While corruption may not be the sole cause of these problems, it is too often a central component, particularly in the poorest countries. And, as noted by anti-corruption expert and Yale University professor Susan Rose-Ackerman, ""curbing corruption is not an alternative to tackling any of the other global ills. It is a precondition for doing so."" Frequent media coverage of corruption is not what keeps society from supporting other indispensable reform efforts or what breeds political instability. It is corruption itself and the inadequacy of reforms to combat it. We have made a good start but much remains to be done. No one believes that ""simply telling these countries to shake off the shackles of corruption"" will work. Transparency International has always recognized that while ""naming and shaming"" may help launch countries into action, it is only one step. Over the past 10 years, TI national chapters in more than 90 countries have mobilized all levels of society to urge governments and the donor community to adopt comprehensive and systemic reform, including an end to impunity. They have promoted greater transparency and enforcement of anti-corruption laws to reduce embezzlement, extortion and bribery. But, as recent events in Kenya demonstrate, opponents of reform are formidable, and courageous proponents need all the support they can get. We should not resurrect the discredited canard that countries prosper despite corruption. Even in such countries, there is ample evidence that the status quo is unacceptable. Given the stakes, we should fault the corrupt, rather than the war on corruption, for the slow progress to date. We must all redouble, not reduce, our efforts. -- Nancy Zucker Boswell -- Peter Eigen Nancy Zucker Boswell is managing director of Transparency International-USA. Peter Eigen is chairman of Transparency International."30-Jul-05,AFRICA (99%); KENYA (92%),"A July 3 front-page article in The Post quoted a Kenyan farmer named Peter Kanans: ""Even if they cancel the debt, even if they give our governments aid money, ordinary Africans will not benefit. That money will only make the corrupt people richer and Africans international beggars for decades to come."" At the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), we have been saying something similar about crime and corruption in Africa, and now that the Group of Eight countries have pledged additional billions of dollars in aid to that continent, it may be time to weigh in on where this money may make the greatest difference for ordinary citizens. We know, as Kanans does, that crime and corruption are enormous obstacles to aid and development. A UNODC report, ""Crime and Development in Africa,"" is filled with examples: Official crime figures, for instance, are unavailable for half of the African nations. In some cases, a lack of courts, prosecutors and workable judicial systems renders the exercise fruitless: ""The police do not have the transport to collect suspects; the courts run out of paper and then can't hear cases until more arrives; parties have to pay marshals to serve summonses; court records are written on already used documents and folders; and some of the court buildings leak so badly that during the rainy season court records get damaged."" In other cases, Africans simply do not report crimes when they know that the authorities will not follow up. These men and women, who are targets for robbery, assault, kidnapping, rape and homicide, understand that without laws or the ability to enforce them, security and development are pipe dreams. This basic fact  --  that the rule of law is fundamental to the effective delivery of aid  --  is one that many member states overlook. Debt relief, billions to attack disease and enable education, legal protections for women and girls, and additional resources from every G-8 nation all sound like the kind of heavy ammunition needed to set Africa right. And these proposals can and will go a long way  --  when it is possible to implement them in a lawful, secure environment. But right now, in post-conflict regions across Africa, organized crime rules economies fueled by guns-for-drugs trading schemes, drug trafficking, the looting of natural resources and enterprises ranging from forced prostitution to child militias to trafficking in human organs. These regions are black holes in the criminal universe, areas rendered so dense by illicit activity that they capture and absorb any attempt at amelioration. Corruption in Africa is a way of life. The poor, in particular, are resigned to unending indignities to body and soul: choices between a weekend in jail on trumped-up charges or surrendering the grocery money to a corrupt police official; bribes to local officials or having no running water; and sex or a ticket for ""breaking curfew"" after working overtime on a job that pays less than $1 per day. On a larger scale, corruption continues to separate the haves from the have-nots in ways that the rest of the world cannot imagine  --  the highest income earners make 31 times what their poorest neighbors bring in. Nigeria's anti-corruption commission recently reported that former rulers  stole or misused more than $386 billion. Unless we lay the proper groundwork in Africa by helping states to institutionalize the rule of law, crime and corruption will undercut the best of intentions. In recent years, foreign investment in Africa has fallen while capital flight has increased. Still, as bad as the situation appears, there are reasons for optimism. Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of UNODC, says it best: ""Africa's hope lies in the hunger of its own people for justice. They see an alternative vision on television, in films and on the Internet. They know things are not just different, but also better in other parts of the world, and they want their fair share of prosperity and justice. This is the energy driving increasing numbers of politicians to campaign on anti-corruption platforms. This is the impetus behind the push for democratically elected governments. This is the force that continues to counter the instinct for conflict and civil violence in places where change has never happened any other way."" Africa's needs are overwhelming  --  money, food, education, medical supplies, infrastructure  --  but there is no assurance that any of this will get to the people who need it most unless we also make sure that withholding, appropriating or misusing these resources is punishable by law. The writer is deputy spokesperson of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime."23-Oct-05,AFRICA (96%); NIGERIA (94%); UNITED KINGDOM (92%); SWITZERLAND (79%),"As Nigeria's point man in the fight to recoup the billions a dictator allegedly stole from the country and hid in Western banks, Christopher Kolade employs diplomacy and moral argument to get the world behind his cause. He says his most important weapon is patience. Kolade believes his patience is about to pay off. Independent experts also see a growing political willingness to address the issue, but caution that momentum may be slow in the West and that Africans still have to persuade the world to act. The effort, however distant the reward, is necessary for reasons both symbolic and practical, said Kolade, Nigeria's ambassador to Britain. ""First, we think it is important to establish the principle that it is wrong to steal public funds,"" he said in an interview. ""Second, we're not talking of small money, we're talking of big money, and Nigeria needs all the money it can get for development purposes."" His government says military dictator Sani Abacha looted oil-rich Nigeria of more than $2.2 billion from when he seized power in 1993 until his death in 1998. The hunt for the money began in earnest after a restored democracy elected Olusegun Obasanjo president in 1999. Kolade believes that much of the money is still in banks in Switzerland, Britain and elsewhere. He says common sense dictates that a bank holding stolen money should hand it over, but ""things aren't done this way."" And Abacha's heirs have gone to court to block recovery efforts. Nigeria is as interested as Western governments in seeing legal processes are followed, Kolade said. The Commission for Africa, appointed by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, cites a study estimating that stolen African assets deposited overseas amount to half the continent's foreign debt. It wants recovered money to go into African development, and Kolade agrees. Among the commission's suggestions: Help Africans develop their legal infrastructure so Western courts will take their claims seriously. The commission's involvement shows that the issue is getting increasing weight, said Tara O'Connor, head of the African office of Kroll Associates, an international firm that has traced stolen assets for several countries. O'Connor dates the change to Sept. 11, 2001, when the rush to cut terrorists' cash flow focused attention on how other criminals  --  whether drug lords or corrupt dictators  --  were using the international banking system. ""Your worst nightmare as a bank is to be splashed on the front page of the Financial Times as 'Abacha's money launderer,' "" O'Connor said. She sees a shift away from dictatorship across Africa that should produce governments more responsive to citizens' complaints of corruption. But she said change is only in the early stages. ""It's not one election that's going to do it,"" she said. ""It's not the first election won on an anti-corruption platform  --  it's the fifth."" ""Nobody wants to return the assets to governments that are as corrupt as their predecessors,"" O'Connor said. Legal processes can slow the return of money to its rightful owners. Britain says it is powerless to freeze money Nigeria was able to show Abacha deposited in British accounts, allowing Abacha's heirs to move it to other countries. A government spokeswoman said Britain hopes to close that loophole with new legislation this year. In February, the Swiss Supreme Court ordered $458 million of Abacha's deposits returned to Nigeria. But the Swiss have been slow to pay  --  in part because they want to be sure the money goes toward development, as Nigeria promised, Swiss officials say. Such arguments try Kolade's patience. ""Abacha steals money in Nigeria, and we all agree that stealing is bad. And he brings it away and hides it in Europe with the knowledge of European leaders,"" Kolade said. ""The West should be handing it over. No, they keep dragging their feet."" The ambassador has taken on high-profile corruption-busting jobs for President Obasanjo. Several senior officials have been ousted in cleanup drives, though critics note that there have been no significant convictions during Obasanjo's six years in office. Western governments that are worried repatriated loot will only feed corruption could reduce the risk by creating trusts to pump the money directly into development, said Richard Dowden, head of Britain's Royal African Society. The West may not be able to do much to fix what's wrong with Africa, he said, but at least it shouldn't help the dictators hide their loot. ""We should stop doing damage,"" Dowden said. ""That, at least, we can deliver."""28-Oct-05,MALAWI (98%); AFRICA (92%),"  A power struggle between President Bingu wa Mutharika and his predecessor and onetime patron, Bakili Muluzi, took a bitter turn when the police raided the home of Mr. Muluzi in Blantyre and other houses of his and his son in Lilongwe and Kapoloma as part of a political corruption inquiry. Mr. Muluzi was questioned by the government's Anti-Corruption Bureau on Monday about allegations that he had diverted $12 million in political donors' funds to his own use. His supporters in Parliament are trying to impeach Mr. Mutharika, who broke with Mr. Muluzi and formed his own political party shortly after being elected last year. Mr. Mutharika has made the fight against corruption a priority of his administration.   Michael Wines (NYT)"23-Nov-05,KENYA (97%); AFRICA (79%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%),"Kenyan voters, venting their frustration with a government that many said had failed to deliver on pledges to create jobs and curb corruption, have overwhelmingly rejected a proposed new constitution that would have given broad powers to President Mwai Kibaki. With almost all ballots counted from Monday's vote, Samuel Kivuitu, chairman of the electoral commission, announced Tuesday that the proposed constitution had lost by 57 percent to 43 percent. The voting was peaceful despite a turbulent campaign and was widely seen as a test of the East African nation's democratic stability. Kibaki, who had campaigned heavily for the revamped constitution, conceded defeat in a live television address to the nation. ""My government will respect the will of the people,"" said Kibaki, 74, looking somber and tired. ""I would like to congratulate all of you for participating peacefully in this historic occasion."" Analysts expressed relief that voting day had been calm after weeks of ethnically charged campaigning. But they also said the defeat of the draft constitution could signal the crumbling of Kibaki's beleaguered government, which was popularly elected in 2002 but has recently lost support from key members of his own party. ""This is a real healthy moment for Kenya and Africa because it shows that democracy can flow here,"" said David Makali, an analyst with Kenya's Media Institute. ""But what remains now is a real challenge and dilemma to the Kibaki administration. Can he make this work? He will have to show true leadership."" The referendum measure, which sought to overhaul the constitution for the first time since Kenya's independence from Britain in 1963, divided voters along ethnic lines and bitterly split Kibaki's ruling coalition. A leading opponent was Raila Odinga, a charismatic cabinet minister whom Kibaki had once promised the prime ministership. On Tuesday, Odinga praised the referendum outcome as ""historic days for our country."" The rejected constitutional changes would have given the president greater power to choose government officials and would have made the prime minister closer to a figurehead. Many voters favored an earlier draft of the charter that would have divided authority more evenly between the two posts, an important safeguard in a region where leaders often cling to power for decades. The rivalry between Kibaki and Odinga has been exacerbated by tribal differences. Kibaki is from the dominant Kikuyu tribe and Odinga, currently minister of roads, is from another large tribe, the Luo. The referendum campaign was marred by tribal and personal slurs, with Kibaki accusing Odinga and other opponents of planning a coup and Odinga saying the constitution could win only through fraud. In the weeks before the vote, nine people were killed in clashes with security forces during opposition rallies. There was widespread concern that polling would be rigged in favor of Kibaki, triggering further violence. But the voting was largely peaceful, although people appeared to generally cast their ballots along tribal lines. On Tuesday, many Kenyans celebrated the results of the referendum, in which illiterate voters were able to participate by choosing between the symbols of a banana for the ""yes"" vote and an orange for the ""no"" vote. ""Maybe this is just the beginning for Kenya. Maybe things can really improve for us,"" said Beatrice Awori, 25, a mother of two who sells fruit at a street stall. ""We sold many oranges today."" Analysts said Kibaki, whose election nearly three years ago was seen as a fresh start for Kenya after the autocratic rule of longtime President Daniel arap Moi, has proven a disappointing, lethargic leader and has allowed the country to drift back into the corrupt practices of the past. They said that he would now have to give key cabinet positions to opposition figures, further weakening his presidency, and that he probably would not be able to win reelection in voting scheduled for 2007. Kibaki, once an energetic politician, suffered strokes and was in a near-fatal car crash in 2002. ""The shareholders of Kenya have spoken. We want leaders, not rulers,"" said Najib Balala, the culture minister and one of the senior officials who opposed the charter. He said Kibaki should ""show good leadership and give opposition leaders more say in his government and give Odinga the prime minister slot."" Earlier this year, Kenya's leading anti-corruption official, John Githongo, resigned after uncovering several multimillion-dollar scams, including graft in official funding for HIV/AIDS programs and for improved passport security. Githongo, a popular figure, said  his life had been threatened by associates of Kibaki's."27-Dec-05,CHAD (95%); CENTRAL AFRICA (92%); SUDAN (79%); AFRICA (79%),"Six months after assuming the presidency of the World Bank, Paul D. Wolfowitz is facing his first big test in his new job. An avowed hard-liner on corruption, he must decide whether the bank should wash its hands of one of its most controversial projects, in a country with a notoriously corrupt regime. At issue is a 650-mile pipeline that the World Bank helped finance for Chad, a landlocked central African nation of about 10 million, to transport oil from the country's interior to a coastal port. Despite objections by critics that oil money in such countries is almost invariably squandered or stolen, the bank backed the pipeline in the hope of showing that Africa could use its mineral riches to benefit the poor. It secured an agreement with Chadian leaders that most of the government's oil proceeds would go into a closely supervised escrow fund in London, to be disbursed and invested on the nation's behalf in areas such as education, health and rural development. Now that the oil has been flowing for two years, the wisdom of the bank's gamble is coming under renewed questioning because the government is threatening to unilaterally change the terms of the deal. Out of cash for its regular budget amid mounting security problems involving army deserters and refugees on the border with Sudan, the government announced in October that it intends to amend the law governing the petrodollars so it can use a larger chunk of the money for any purpose it likes, including its security forces. Under the proposed new law, the government would double, to 30 percent, the amount of oil money that it can spend without oversight. The government would also halt the diversion of 10 percent of the oil money into a ""future generations"" fund that is to be spent only after Chad's oil wells run dry. A low point for the bank came several weeks ago after repeated phone calls from Wolfowitz to Chad's president, Idriss Deby, went unreturned, according to bank officials, who said the episode aroused considerable consternation in their ranks. Deby has taken a defiant public stance in response to the bank's protests against the proposed legal changes, declaring last month, ""I will not allow anyone, even if they are a partner, to violate our national sovereignty."" Deepening the bank's woes, its resident representative in Chad, Noel Tshiani, was placed on leave after  allegations of sexual  harassment, according to Chadian press reports that bank officials confirmed only on condition of anonymity because the matter is under investigation. Tshiani declined to respond to e-mails seeking comment. In the past few days, however, the situation has improved slightly  as the government postponed parliamentary action on the legal changes and sent a letter dated Dec. 16 asking the bank to dispatch a high-level mission ""as soon as possible"" to N'Djamena, the capital  --  possibly an olive branch, though bank officials are not sure. All this poses a tough dilemma for Wolfowitz, the former U.S. deputy defense secretary who took the bank's helm last June pledging to put a high priority on intensifying the bank's anti-corruption efforts. The bank has the legal right to take punitive measures in response to any action by the Chadian government to change the agreement, which so far has generated more than $300 million in revenue for public purposes in Chad. The measures could include barring new aid to the country and insisting on immediate repayment of the loans it made for the pipeline. But the bank is instinctively loath to cut off financial ties with a country; it argues that the country's poor are likely to suffer most from the withholding of aid  --  a painful prospect in Chad, one of the world's most impoverished nations, where 80 percent of the population relies on subsistence farming and livestock raising. In Chad's case, a cutoff of bank money raises serious geopolitical concerns as well, because it might increase the risk of a financial collapse for the government that could lead to Chad joining other neighboring countries as a failed state and a haven for terrorists. The cash-strapped government has already fallen into arrears on salary payments to civil servants. Doing the same to the military raises the danger of a bloody coup against Deby, who has ruled Chad since seizing power in 1990. On the other hand, if Wolfowitz is too flexible with Chad, he risks exposing the World Bank and himself to criticism that the fight against corruption is little more than hot air. Chad tied with Bangladesh for the worst corruption rating among nations in the most recent annual survey by Transparency International. The government's cash squeeze suggests that misappropriation of public resources is continuing apace. Normal budget accounting is nonexistent, and bank officials cannot understand how the government can be broke, especially since it has directly received some of the oil money, about $38 million, for its general budget. Allowing the government to take money from the London escrow fund might only invite further waste and would set a terrible precedent for future projects in the oil and mining sector, bank officials fear, by signaling that such ""ring-fencing"" arrangements don't work. So far, Wolfowitz has limited himself to a statement expressing ""serious concern"" about the proposed changes in the law, which ""threaten to undermine the objectives of socio-economic development, poverty reduction, accountability and transparency,"" according to the statement. Bank officials declined to go beyond the statement, or speak on the record at all, citing the delicacy of negotiations with the Chadians. The bank's statement, issued Dec. 8, is viewed as too timid by many antipoverty activists, both inside and outside of Chad. The bank's difficulties, they contend, shows that their doubts about the project were well founded. ""I've tried not to say 'I told you so,' "" said Ian Gary, a policy adviser  for Oxfam America who is a longtime critic of the pipeline. ""We had always feared that the leverage of the World Bank and other donors would decrease substantially once these oil revenues started to flow, and that's what's happening."" ""But there's no good solution right now,"" Gary said, adding that although he thinks the bank should respond very sternly if Chad violates the terms of its agreement, ""I wouldn't want to be in their position."" Chad's finance minister, Abbas Mahamat Tolli, contended in a phone interview that the government has good reason for insisting on changing the agreement. Although world oil prices have roughly doubled since the pipeline deal was signed, the revenue going to the government has been ""disappointing,"" he said, and the government questions the international oil companies' explanation that much of the petroleum being pumped is laden with impurities. ""Relative to our needs for poverty reduction, and the lack of security, the amount of money we are getting is rather small,"" he said. ""We understand that in principle it's good to save for the future. But the people of Chad don't understand why they should be told they must save for future generations when they have needs right now."" Spending money to improve security in the often-lawless countryside, he added, is perfectly consistent with poverty reduction, because ""we can't conceive of economic development in an environment which is not secure."" Bank officials say they are willing to sit down with the Chadians and examine the reasons for the government's cash woes and its increased needs. The bank might accept amendments to the agreement, a staffer said, ""but they have to be arrived at logically, in a structured review process, not just coming out of thin air."" The letter of invitation for the bank to send a mission, which is also addressed to the International Monetary Fund, could provide an opening for a mutually satisfactory compromise. But bank officials are crossing their fingers, because the letter also suggests that the Chadians will stick to their guns. ""[T]he Government of Chad is surprised by the position your two institutions have taken, in which you claim you were not informed by our intention to make changes to the Petroleum Revenue Management Law,"" states the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post. ""We're trying to work through this thing,"" another bank official said. ""We're hoping for further dialogue."""7-Jan-06,CHAD (94%); AFRICA (92%); SUDAN (79%),"World Bank President Paul D. Wolfowitz announced yesterday that he is suspending all of the bank's aid to Chad, taking a hard line in the first major test of his pledge to fight corruption. The move followed a serious setback in a controversial oil pipeline project for Chad that the bank had trumpeted to show how it could help African nations use their natural resource wealth honestly and effectively. In numerous previous instances, such wealth has been squandered or stolen. The bank agreed in 1999 to help finance the 650-mile pipeline, which enables landlocked Chad to export its oil, on the condition that most of the revenue go into a special fund in London to be used for projects such as schools and health clinics benefiting Chad's poor. But the Chadian government recently insisted on taking more of the money for its own purposes, including strengthening its security forces, despite the bank's objections. Wolfowitz said he acted after speaking by phone with Chad's president, Idriss Deby, for 45 minutes Tuesday and two hours Thursday. ""There did not seem to be any movement in their decision to amend the law that was the basis of the 1999 agreement, and until we can come to a better understanding, we have to suspend disbursements on World Bank loans to Chad,"" Wolfowitz said. Wolfowitz emphasized that ""this is not the end of dialogue or the end of negotiations,"" and that ""our actions can be reversed anytime we reach an agreement with Chad."" He voiced sympathy for Deby's complaints that the country has serious security problems from the inflow of refugees from neighboring Sudan, which is riven by civil strife. But especially since the government has yet to satisfactorily explain how it has spent the money thus far, Wolfowitz said, he was obliged to counter Chad's ""breach"" of the pipeline deal. The situation in Chad has presented Wolfowitz with an acute dilemma six months after taking the bank's helm and pledging to put a high priority on the bank's anti-corruption initiatives. Chad tied with Bangladesh for the worst corruption rating among nations in a 2005 survey by Transparency International, an organization that monitors corruption worldwide. Allowing the Deby government more access to unmonitored oil revenue, bank officials fear, would simply lead to more waste. But the bank usually refrains from cutting off loans to countries except in extreme circumstances because the poor in those countries would presumably bear the brunt of the pain. Moreover, Chad presents serious geopolitical concerns; a collapse of the government could cause the country to join some of its neighbors as a failed state and haven for terrorists, a matter about which Wolfowitz, a former deputy secretary of defense, is keenly aware. Under the actions announced yesterday, the bank will freeze about $124 million that was due to be disbursed on projects in Chad over several years, and it will also halt new loans and grants. The bank also had the right to demand accelerated repayment of $41 million that Chad still owes on the pipeline loan, but Wolfowitz did not invoke that penalty. The bank is one of Chad's major sources of support, but the government has received about $300 million annually in recent years in various forms of aid from donors including the U.S. and French governments, the European Union, the African Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Wolfowitz declined to speculate on how other donors may react. ""We're not offering them any recommendations one way or another,"" he said, although he is asking them to prod the Chadian government to take the situation seriously and engage in negotiations. Given the situation on the Sudanese border, he added, ""it may in fact be an argument for, in the right circumstances, some donors considering additional assistance."" Wolfowitz's decision was praised by Ian Gary, a policy adviser for Oxfam America who is a longtime critic of the pipeline. ""The World Bank did what it needed to do,"" he said. He asserted, however, that the debacle shows that the bank should refrain from funding similar projects in the future. ""This has been rightly seen as a major test case of whether World Bank involvement in a project like this could achieve the poverty reduction that we all want to see,"" Gary said. In Chad's capital of N'Djamena, Oil Minister Nasser Mohammed Hassan said the government plans to  issue a statement today , the Associated Press reported."2-Feb-06,KENYA (94%); AFRICA (90%),"  Kenya's finance minister, David Mwiraria, left, announced his resignation after allegations of corruption. President Mwai Kibaki's former anti-corruption ombudsman, John Githongo, and the independent newspaper The Daily Nation have said that Mr. Mwiraria was among senior officials, including Vice President Moody Awori and Energy Minister Kiraitu Murungi, who were behind several schemes involving nonexistent companies receiving government payments for security contracts. Earlier yesterday, an Anti-Corruption Commission official said that Mr. Awori had been questioned in one multimillion-dollar fraud. On Tuesday, the World Bank said it was withholding $260 million in loans to Kenya because of corruption concerns."20-Feb-06,KENYA (99%),"With Kenyan cabinet ministers resigning and the police seizing the passports of officials linked to corruption, John Githongo, the onetime government insider who set it all in motion, contends that the country may have turned an important corner in the fight against graft. ''We're beginning to see for the first time political accountability for corruption,'' Mr. Githongo said in a telephone interview from Britain, where he sought refuge last year after his anticorruption work began to threaten powerful people and he began to fear for his life. ''This is new. It's unprecedented in Kenya.'' Mr. Githongo had been President Mwai Kibaki's anticorruption czar, responsible for rooting out improper deals in an administration that vowed to clean up government when it took office in December 2002. After discovering corrupt dealings in his midst, Mr. Githongo reported it to the president and stirred up so much anxiety that money mysteriously began being wired back into Kenya's Central Bank. Still, the presidential aides Mr. Githongo linked to the suspect deals remained in the government. Not-so-veiled threats reached Mr. Githongo. Eventually, he fled to Oxford, where he now works as a research fellow at St. Antony's College. From there, he has been releasing details of the deals he uncovered, roiling the government he used to serve. For years, corruption was an open secret in Kenya, from police officers who demanded something from people they encountered on the street to politicians who treated government contracts as get-rich-quick schemes. Immediately after President Kibaki took office, there were signs of change. Kenyans chased down corrupt police officers and plucked bribes from their hands. Politicians said that government coffers would no longer be used for personal gain. But then Mr. Githongo began to find that graft was resurfacing, and the ensuing scandal has changed the political landscape here. Never before has there been so much public uproar about corruption, or so significant a public response. In recent weeks, Finance Minister David Mwiraria and Energy Minister Kiraitu Murungi have resigned. Education Minister George Saitoti has also resigned, and was ordered to turn in his passport, as were Gideon and Philip Moi, the sons of former President Daniel arap Moi, among others. Then on Friday, as thousands took part in an antigraft demonstration, former Transport Minister Chris Murungaru, who was recently dropped from the cabinet, was charged with failing to declare his wealth to the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission, Agence France-Presse reported. Still, no high-level official has been convicted of corruption. ''The issue is whether our institutions are up to investigating and prosecuting those guilty of corrupt acts,'' Mr. Githongo said. ''Kenya is in new territory there.'' He said he was not gloating. ''This has to be a very trying time for my former colleagues and their families,'' he said. ''I don't want to sound as if I'm enjoying this.'' Mr. Githongo, who was criticized by some ministers he identified for fleeing, said his stay overseas would be temporary. ''I'm looking forward to coming home,'' he said. Last week, members of a parliamentary committee visited to quiz him on the so-called Anglo-Leasing scandal, in which a shadow company was given major contracts for security-related projects for which little or no work was done. Mr. Githongo said he was encouraged that Kenya, however paralyzing the current political scandal had become, was at least moving in what he called the right direction. ''It's moving forward -- painfully but, yes, it's moving forward,'' he said.

Beads of sweat rolled down her forehead as she explained that she was trying to earn enough money to move her family out of the country's north, where a drought has dried up rivers, turned green fields to dust and left as many as 3.5 million Kenyans on the brink of starvation. Ciira, an unemployed college graduate, said she never thought her family would so desperately need her help. She had put her trust in President Mwai Kibaki, who was elected in 2002 on vows to stamp out corruption, generate jobs and help farmers in the often-neglected north. But those promises have evaporated. The Kenyan government can barely afford to feed its hungry citizens, much less make good on campaign pledges, largely because past and present administrations have looted the country's treasury in one corruption scandal after another. ""We're a thirsty land of empty promises. Other countries have droughts and you never see their people dying,"" Ciira said in this town 50 miles northwest of Nairobi. As she spoke, people gathered around her, some waving copies of one of Kenya's daily newspapers, the Nation, with a three-page spread detailing the largest scandals. ""Look at us selling fruits at intersections when our leaders are feathering their nests and filling their stomachs,"" she said. ""Surely, I am filled with tears."" Last week, dramatic details of two of the largest scandals have implicated high-level officials, some of whom allegedly pocketed a total of $1.3 billion in public funds, money that critics say should have gone to irrigation and road projects to help protect farmers from the devastating effects of recurring droughts. As the country's worst drought in 20 years wears on, many Kenyans are blaming government corruption, not Mother Nature, for their dire situation. The crisis highlights how government fraud and mismanagement can worsen, and in some cases create, food shortages. On Friday, thousands of Kenyans protested in the streets of Nairobi, the capital, demanding the resignation of officials linked to the scandals. ""Our money, our money! Sack our leaders,"" they shouted from the city's central Uhuru Park. ""Nobody blames the government for the drought, but it is guilty of the famine situation,"" Billows Kerrow, an opposition member of parliament, said in an interview in the magazine Drum, which ran a cover article last week titled ""Famine: An Unnatural Disaster?"" In the most recent controversy, known as the Anglo Leasing scandal, more than $300 million was awarded in contracts for new tamper-proof passports, modern forensic labs and other projects to improve security. But the money disappeared, and top members of the president's office were accused of pocketing the funds. The country's former anti-corruption czar, John Githongo, secretly recorded a conversation in which he said a high-level minister tried to block the investigation into the missing millions. In the recording, which Githongo recently gave to the BBC, a man tries to slow down the investigation and tells Githongo that the repayment of a loan his father received from a government official ""could go slow, if you go slow on the investigation."" Githongo fled to Britain and quit his job last year after receiving death threats. The disclosures occurred as the U.N. World Food Program began urgently appealing for $225 million in food aid. ""This is actually good for the country to go through,"" said Killian Lugwe, 40, a hotel manager. ""We're all counting those millions stolen and looking at those suffering in the north. We have to speak out and endure what must be hard growing pains to clean up Kenya. Maybe then the next round of leaders will think twice before stealing."" After the tapes were publicized, the Kibaki government released a long-awaited report on a 1990s corruption case involving officials from the previous and current governments. In that scandal, dubbed the Goldenberg affair, taxpayer dollars were used to fund shell companies for exporting nonexistent Kenyan diamonds and gold. The country lost hundreds of millions of dollars paid to Goldenberg International, a fake Kenyan company. In recent weeks, three Kenyan officials have resigned, saying they are innocent but want to clear their names At the same time, two sons of former president Daniel arap Moi, an autocratic and corrupt leader who ruled the country for more than two decades before he stepped down, and 20 officials were also implicated in the widening Goldenberg probe and were forced to surrender their passports and firearms. In much of Africa, corruption is a top concern of ordinary citizens, many of whom live in extreme poverty while their political leaders drive luxury cars, enjoy personal helicopters and live in sprawling villas. The problem is acute in Kenya, where subsistence farming is a way of life for the majority of the population and where just one season without rain can mean widespread hunger. ""These parts of Kenya look like war zones. I've never seen so many dead animals. And there's no need for it. Every minister needs to be spending state money on development projects for their own citizens,"" said Tony Hall, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Program, who recently visited the drought-hit areas. ""They've certainly got the money here. Kenyans have every right to be upset and to demand these things so that millions don't go hungry while there is massive corruption."" Aid groups say that at least 40 people have died in Kenya  because of famine-related illnesses. In the country's north and east, a third of children under 5 are malnourished, triple the usual number in those regions. The region's herds of livestock  --  the life-support system for most families  --  have fallen by 70 percent in some places, leaving the carcasses of more than a quarter-million cows, goats and even the usually hearty camels rotting in the sun. In an interview in Nairobi, Col. Shem Amadi, director of National Operations Center for the office of the president, said the country is suffering a cumulative problem dating back to the Moi era. ""Every day, Kenyans wake up and compare 24 years of rule to a system here for three years,"" said Amadi, who has helped coordinate military flights to deliver food aid. ""What's happening in Kenya today has been accumulating for decades. There's been a collapse in infrastructure, weather changes, AIDS; you can't pinpoint it all on corruption. But we do know it's there and we must do better to protect our less fortunate."" Although Kenya has the largest number of people in need in East Africa, a lack of water and nearly 15 years of armed conflict in Somalia have left 1.7 million in need of food aid there. In Ethiopia, 1.75 million are in need of food along with 60,000 in Djibouti, according to the World Food Program. Peter Smerdon, spokesman for the World Food Program in Nairobi, said if calls for donations went unanswered, Kenya could turn into another Niger, where aid arrived only after a significant number of deaths. ""We need to be demanding irrigation projects and feeding those in need right away,"" said Brendan Cox, emergency coordinator for Oxfam International, who has been working in the affected regions. ""If the response isn't adequate, this could be the worst food shortage in Kenya's modern history. The sad thing is we should have never been in this situation."""24-Feb-06,CONGO (92%),"THE WORLD Bank's board faces a decision on debt relief today that has broad ramifications for development. The Congo Republic, a small oil state, hopes to win approval of a reduction in its debt , and by some measures it may deserve that. Under the rules governing debt relief, a country whose debt is worth 21/2 times its government revenue qualifies for forgiveness, and a team from the International Monetary Fund has determined that Congo meets this standard. But Congo's corrupt government keeps part of its oil revenue from showing up on its books, raising questions as to whether it deserves forgiveness. The World Bank's president, Paul D. Wolfowitz, rightly argues that debt relief should be delayed. The governments that sit on the bank's board, including African representatives and the Europeans who often support them, should accept Mr. Wolfowitz's position. Congo's efforts to hide oil revenue have been amply documented. The British watchdog group Global Witness has described a network of shell companies established to keep money away from creditors. KPMG, the auditor of Congo's state oil company, has refused to sign off on its accounts three years running. In a memo explaining the finding that Congo met the test for debt relief, the International Monetary Fund concedes that ""oil revenues continue to be diverted for other uses and do not reach the treasury."" Congo's supporters on the World Bank's board argue that the country has met the objective test for debt relief and should not be kept waiting. It's hard to take this seriously. Mr. Wolfowitz's proposed remedy is moderate. He suggests that Congo should adopt measures to reduce oil corruption, a position with which even Congo's defenders concur. But rather than having this trigger an immediate and irrevocable $2 billion worth of debt relief, Mr. Wolfowitz wants Congo to implement the anti-corruption measures for three years before getting full debt reduction. In the meantime, relief would flow into a carefully monitored poverty-reduction fund. This would allow Congo to reap some development benefits while maintaining incentives to fight corruption, at least for three years. Given that Congo is benefiting in the meantime from high oil prices, this hardly seems draconian. The larger issue behind this fight is the seriousness with which donors are willing to take on corruption. Big strides have been made over the past decade in acknowledging that corruption is a problem, but, too often, corrupt countries have been indulged by donors. If Congo's allies on the World Bank's board get their way today, the see-no-evil faction will have won. Better to proceed slowly on Congo  --  and send a needed wake-up call to other corrupt countries."13-Mar-06,"AFRICA (94%); UNITED STATES (92%); IRAQ (92%); UNITED KINGDOM (91%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (79%); CONGO (79%)","Last year was celebrated as the ""Year of Africa."" Tony Blair proposed a doubling of aid to the continent; the world's rich nations promised debt elimination; and the Bush administration talked up its remarkably good record in boosting foreign assistance. But 2006 is shaping up as the year of ""What to do with Africa?"" as donors grapple with the challenge of making aid work. And unless the development institutions demonstrate that they can spend the money effectively, 2007 may be the year in which Africa is once again abandoned. Just look at the Republic of the Congo, a small oil state that lies to the west of the other, bigger Congo, which used to be Zaire. The Congo we're talking about has mountains of debt and canyons of poverty, so it's a candidate for the debt cancellation that was trumpeted last year. But it's also rotten with corruption, rendering most aid efforts pointless. When the matter of Congo's debt relief came before the boards of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund recently, there was a chance to confront this dilemma. Instead, the institutions tried to have it both ways. Last week they acknowledged Congo's corruption but cut the country's debt payments anyway. If the bank and the IMF aren't careful, Congo could emerge as their version of the oil-for-food scandal that discredited the United Nations last year. Congo's oil rogues are in cahoots with some of the same operators who cropped up in the Volcker report on Iraq's oil rip-offs. Both cases make the French establishment look odious. Both involve multilateral institutions whose staffs might want to blow the whistle on corruption but who are discouraged from doing so by political masters in Western capitals. The workings of the Congolese kleptocracy have emerged thanks to three forces: Earlier efforts by the IMF and World Bank to demand transparency; court cases brought by frustrated creditors; and the investigative efforts of Global Witness, a British development group. The star of the story is Denis Gokana, the head of the state oil company, who has arranged for more than $400 million worth of Congo's oil to be sold to shell companies owned by none other than himself, according to British court records. Just as in the Iraq oil scam, these sales were discounted, enabling the shell companies to sell the oil  at a nice profit to firms such as Glencore  --  which, according to the Volcker report, was a leading provider of kickbacks to Saddam Hussein  under the oil-for-food program. Sales at suspiciously low prices were just one method for draining profits from Congo's national oil company and, therefore, from the Congolese people. Gokana's shell companies also lent money to the state oil firm at interest rates higher than 80 percent per year, according to Global Witness. Meanwhile, one of the Gokana firms acquired a tenth of a promising Congolese oil bloc known as Marine XI, at a price that has never been published. The lead investor in Marine XI is a company controlled by an oilman named Patrick Maugein, who also  appears in the Volcker report. Maugein's company is reported to have bid considerably less for the concession than a Canadian rival but won it anyway with what the company describes as the ""best"" offer. Last year Gokana appeared in a British court to answer some of these charges. The judge ruled that his testimony was riddled with lies. The creditor that brought that court case, Kensington International, has also brought a racketeering case in New York, alleging that BNP Paribas, a major French bank, has colluded with Congolese officials to hide oil revenue. BNP was the leading financier of Iraq's oil-for-food deals, and it was accused  in the Volcker report of turning a blind eye to the use of front companies to hide the real identities of  Hussein's oil partners. BNP disputes Kensington's allegations and has described the case as an ""abuse."" Whatever the French bank's role, Congo's corruption appears not to offend the French government, which has led the charge to grant Congo debt relief even though the evidence of its unworthiness has been reported in the French press. In a detailed article in December, the French daily La Tribune explained how millions had been siphoned out of the national oil company and how yet more millions failed to make it from the national oil company to the national treasury. But, as La Tribune noted, President Jacques Chirac and Congo's ruling strongman are old friends. This is a scandal, and it's hard to see why the rich world's taxpayers should tolerate even a hint of debt relief for Congo. Last year the country earned more than $2 billion from oil, or $600 per person; if it spent that money competently, it would not have two-thirds of its people living below the $1-a-day line. But rather than send that message, the World Bank and the IMF have cut Congo's debt payments and held out the hope of outright debt cancellation, provided that the country meets various anti-corruption conditions. In the past, Congo has mocked such conditions. It would probably mock them in the future the day after full debt cancellation went through. Why does this seem likely? Because you don't have to guess what Congo's president thinks of the fight for transparent government. In an interview in February, he dismissed the critics of corruption as ""people who search for lice in the heads of this country's authorities."" smallaby@washpost.com"26-Mar-06,AFRICA (95%); NIGERIA (94%); TOGO (93%); SUDAN (93%); LIBERIA (93%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%); COTE D'IVOIRE (79%); NIGER (79%),"When President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria visits Washington this week, he will probably be lauded for his crucial role as a regional African leader. During his seven years in power, Mr. Obasanjo helped end Liberia's civil war by taking in the strongman Charles Taylor and refused to accept a coup in Togo. He was instrumental in making sure that the African Union did not destroy its international credibility by installing Sudan's president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, as its head despite the continuing carnage in Darfur. President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, the continent's other big player, could learn a lot from Mr. Obasanjo about how to use his country's economic and military strength to promote peace and stability around the region. Unfortunately, while Mr. Obasanjo deserves credit for good deeds outside of Nigeria, his own country is deteriorating fast and he is partly to blame. For one thing, by trying to change Nigeria's Constitution to allow himself to run for a third four-year term as president, Mr. Obasanjo is further enflaming political tensions among Nigeria's polarized ethnic groups, particularly the Muslims in the north and Christians in the south. Nigeria lost more than 100 people in tit-for-tat sectarian rioting over Danish caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. In the north, Muslims attacked and killed Christians. In the south, Christian mobs wielding machetes and knives set upon their Muslim neighbors in retaliation. And in the Niger River delta, militants seeking more local control over oil money have attacked pipelines and even captured oil workers. Fueling some of this is the perception, right or wrong, that Mr. Obasanjo's much vaunted anti-corruption campaign concentrates only on critics of his government. Certainly, bad things continue to happen to foes of the Obasanjo government. Three months ago, the wife of a prominent northern politician was found stabbed to death in her home. Nothing was taken from the house, leading many to conclude that her killing was a warning to her husband, Abubakar Rimi, a crucial member of a coalition of powerful northerners opposed to any extension of Mr. Obasanjo's rule. And last week, police arrested Mr. Rimi and other opposition leaders for trying to hold a peaceful rally. The last thing Africa needs is its most populous country -- Nigeria has between 120 million and 150 million people -- in a civil war. An out-of-control Nigeria would undermine its already fragile neighbors, like Liberia, Togo, Ivory Coast and the Congo. In his two terms, Mr. Obasanjo has helped bring stability to a volatile region. But two terms is enough, and it is incumbent on President Bush to tell Mr. Obasanjo that changing his country's Constitution so that he can remain in office is foolhardy. Another four years is not worth a Nigerian civil war."27-Apr-06,CHAD (95%); SUDAN (92%); AFRICA (79%),"Four months after suspending all aid to Chad and freezing the country's oil revenue in a high-profile move against corruption, the World Bank reached a compromise that would restore Chad's access to some of its oil funds while requiring the country's leaders to spend much of the money on anti-poverty projects under close supervision. The interim agreement was disclosed in a statement issued by the World Bank last night. The move defuses, at least temporarily, a confrontation between Paul D. Wolfowitz, the World Bank's president, and Idriss Deby, Chad's president, that has emerged as one of the first major tests of Wolfowitz's avowed determination to take a hard line against corrupt governments. At issue is a 650-mile pipeline that the World Bank agreed to help finance in 1999, enabling landlocked Chad to export its oil. The bank trumpeted the project as a showcase for how it could help poor African nations use their natural-resource wealth honestly and effectively by establishing an elaborate system to keep the money from being stolen or squandered. Most of the revenue went into a special fund in London, where it was earmarked for projects such as schools and health clinics. But late last year, the Chadian government unilaterally amended the law governing the use of the petrodollars, saying it needed the funds to beef up its security forces amid a growing refugee problem on its border with Sudan. That presented Wolfowitz with a painful dilemma, because failing to crack down would undermine his anti-corruption campaign, while taking too tough a stance risked a collapse of the Deby regime that could turn Chad into a failed state and a haven for terrorists. On Jan. 6, Wolfowitz announced that he was suspending about $124 million that was due to be disbursed on projects in Chad over several years, and more important to the Chadians, he effectively blocked the government's access to the funds in London. In recent weeks, the security situation in Chad has deteriorated further, with Sudanese forces reportedly invading eastern portions of the country and rebels in the capital staging an attempted coup. Meanwhile, Chad was missing out on more than $100 million in royalties and dividends that it would have gotten under the original arrangement, a source of enormous frustration to Deby, who threatened at one point to stop the flow of oil through the pipeline. The agreement finalized yesterday would give something to both sides. For each of the next three months, Chad would get access to a portion of its frozen oil revenue, while the government would have to take steps to ensure that it was honoring the spirit of the original agreement to channel much of the money into anti-poverty projects. Chad wanted to double, to 30 percent, the portion of the oil revenue that it could use for whatever purposes the government wished, and the bank will go along on that issue. But Deby is retreating on some positions as well. Before getting any money, the government must revise its budget law to show how it will devote the remainder of the funds to projects benefiting the nation's poor. Chad's government is also  agreeing to improve its public finances, including stricter audits of oil revenues. ""Our aim has always been to help the Government improve the basic services Chad's people desperately require,"" Wolfowitz said in the statement. ""Suspending aid was a difficult decision but one the Bank had to take . . .  to ensure that resources went to benefit the poor people of Chad."" Although a final agreement is yet to be reached, ""We believe the steps outlined in this accord provide a way forward to ensure that the people of Chad see the benefits of the aid and oil revenue their country receives,"" he added. The deal leaves some issues unresolved, notably whether Chad would restore a ""future generations fund"" that was established under the original agreement with the World Bank, the aim being to make sure that the country has money left over after its oil runs out."2-May-06,AFRICA (95%); SOUTH AFRICA (94%); SIERRA LEONE (93%); RWANDA (92%); LIBERIA (92%); ZAMBIA (79%); MALAWI (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); NETHERLANDS (79%); NIGERIA (79%); KENYA (79%),"The arrest  in March of former Liberian president Charles Taylor was the latest in a series of tentative steps toward holding political leaders in Africa accountable for alleged crimes including corruption, rape and genocide. After decades in which senior government officials were largely beyond the reach of national and international law, prosecutors recently have pursued Taylor for war crimes committed in Sierra Leone, a U.N.-backed tribunal has tried former leaders in the 1994 Rwandan genocide, and international investigators have been invited into four other African countries. National courts have also become increasingly aggressive.  In Zambia, former president Frederick Chiluba  is battling corruption allegations, as are several top officials in Nigeria, Kenya and Malawi. In South Africa, former deputy president Jacob Zuma, accused of raping a family friend half his age, is awaiting a court judgment. ""There is a very important shift in the way people conceive of power and want to do things on the continent,"" said Claude Kabemba, who monitors governance issues across Africa for the Human Sciences Research Council in Pretoria, South Africa. ""Impunity in many instances is not allowed as it was a decade ago."" The recent series  of legal proceedings across the continent has the feel of victors' justice to some observers. Taylor's arrest was facilitated by President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, a former political rival. The case against Chiluba has been pushed by his successor. And Zuma, a populist once widely expected to be South Africa's next president, has blamed his legal troubles on a conspiracy to block his ascent to power. Despite the political flavor of many of the cases, however, analysts, legal experts and human rights activists say the court actions mark a new era in which African disputes increasingly are being resolved by  judges rather than soldiers. It may be a necessary first step, these advocates say, toward a more advanced variety of the rule of law in which all citizens  --  regardless of political power  --  are treated equally by impartial courts. ""What's wrong with victors' justice if this is a better form of justice than was there before?"" said Desmond deSilva, chief prosecutor of the U.N.-backed tribunal trying Taylor. De Silva recently announced his resignation from the post but said he hoped to return to the job to lead Taylor's prosecution. Taylor now waits in a jail cell in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, for trial on 11 counts of war crimes, including crimes against humanity for backing a rebel group that relied heavily on child soldiers and was known for mass rapes and severing the limbs of civilians. He has pleaded not guilty. The rise in international tribunals began in the 1990s after the genocides in Rwanda and Bosnia. The movement gained strength with the creation of the International Criminal Court in The Hague in 2002. The Bush administration opposed the international tribunal, instead supporting special courts such as the one that is trying Taylor. It argued that a permanent international court with broad authority could infringe on U.S. sovereignty and put its citizens in improper legal jeopardy. Despite U.S. opposition, support for the International Criminal Court is strong throughout most of the world, and it is widely seen as a way to bring the world's worst human rights violators to justice. The idea has grown popular enough in Africa that national leaders, who traditionally have jealously guarded their sovereignty, have turned to the international court for help. The presidents of Ivory Coast, Congo and Uganda asked the International Criminal Court to investigate the actions of armed groups that control parts of their countries, and in Uganda and Congo arrest warrants  have been issued for militia leaders. In the Central African Republic, President Francois Bozize has asked the court to investigate the actions of his predecessor, Ange-Felix Patasse. ""Politically, it makes sense to be an exponent of justice,"" said Richard Dicker, head of the international justice program for Human Rights Watch, speaking from the organization's New York headquarters. As international courts have gained strength, national courts in many nations have grown in clout and independence. With the decline of leaders who rule for life, newer generations of African leaders increasingly have been pressured  -- by the international community and  their own citizens  --  to rely on means other than violence to resolve their disputes. ""There seems to be a movement to say we will not tolerate a situation in which impunity is a norm,"" said Nobuntu Mbelle, coordinator of the Coalition for an Effective African Court on Human and People's Rights, with offices in both South Africa and Nigeria. ""It's not business as usual."" Corruption investigations in Kenya have led to the resignations of three cabinet ministers, and two sons of former president Daniel arap Moi have been accused of wrongdoing. In South Africa, which in the 12 years since the end of apartheid has become a diplomatic powerhouse and a democratic role model to many other countries, Zuma faces the prospect of years in jail for his rape charge.  He also faces corruption allegations. Many South Africans saw political motives in the prosecutions of Zuma. The same is true in Nigeria, where the anti-corruption campaign led by President Olusegun Obasanjo is seen by many within his country as an attack on enemies as he clears the way for a possible run for a third four-year term. One effect of the prominent court cases has been to modestly curb corruption in Nigeria, according to political analysts there, because officials are attempting to insulate themselves against damaging investigations. Another effect is a growing, if grudging, respect for the rule of law, said Chidi Odinkalu, founder of Coalition Against Impunity, a Nigerian-based umbrella group of more than 350 human rights organizations worldwide. ""The motivations are less altruistic than promotion of the rule of law for the heck of it,"" said Odinkalu, speaking from Lagos, Nigeria. He added, ""The politics of the rule of law is having positive consequences for the cause of justice."" There are crucial exceptions, including the longevity of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who has ruled his southern African nation through increasingly authoritarian means since 1980. Other African leaders have been reluctant to challenge his authority, despite devastating economic decline and extensive evidence of human rights abuses and election rigging. Even some advocates for imposing international standards of justice in Africa worry that the fear of prosecution has encouraged Mugabe, 82, to resort to any means to stay in power. Enduring that problem, said John Stremlau, a former professor of international relations in Johannesburg now working at the Carter Center in Atlanta, is better than forgoing justice for the victims of the most brutal of African regimes. ""Putting rogues at risk is a good thing,"" said Stremlau, speaking from Atlanta. ""It's fraught with idiosyncrasies and inconsistencies, but the trend line is right."""17-Jun-06,GAMBIA (94%); UNITED STATES (92%); AFRICA (92%),"  The Millennium Challenge Corporation, an American aid agency that provides large grants to well-governed poor countries, suspended Gambia's eligibility, citing a sharp deterioration in press freedom, political rights and anti-corruption efforts. As elections near, the government has barred opposition parties from holding public gatherings and has arrested opposition leaders, according to Freedom House, a research group the aid agency relies on for country evaluations.   CELIA W. DUGGER (NYT)"15-Jul-06,CHAD (94%); AFRICA (93%); SUDAN (79%),"The World Bank and Chad have resolved a dispute over the use of Chad's oil revenue, defusing a clash that has tested the anti-corruption credentials of the bank's president, Paul D. Wolfowitz. The agreement, announced by the bank yesterday, was made possible in part because the soaring price of oil presents Chad, one of Africa's most impoverished nations, with an unanticipated windfall. The pact concerns a 650-mile pipeline that the bank helped finance in 1999 so landlocked Chad could export its oil. Skeptics warned that riches from such projects almost always line the pockets of corrupt elites, but the bank vowed to make Chad a showcase for how it could help African nations use their natural-resource wealth to help the poor. Under yesterday's accord, Chad has promised that 70 percent of its budgetary resources in 2007 will go for poverty-reduction purposes  --  a wide range of programs including health, education, infrastructure, de-mining and rural development. ""This is a huge step forward,"" Wolfowitz said, because the government of President Idriss Deby is pledging that all its oil-related revenue will go to those programs, not just the royalties specified in previous agreements. But Ian Gary, a policy adviser for the anti-poverty group Oxfam America and longtime critic of the project, said that with the government now likely to reap far more petrodollars than previously assumed, he is more concerned than ever about the danger of waste and pilferage. ""There's a huge windfall that wasn't expected, wasn't planned for, and certainly is going to test the budget system in a country where that system is already broken,"" Gary said. Battles with the Deby regime over its use of oil money presented Wolfowitz with one of his biggest challenges since he took the bank presidency in June 2005. Having vowed to crack down on corruption, he was obliged to take a tough line but concerned about causing the collapse of Chad's government, which would risk turning the country into a failed state and a haven for terrorists. Until late last year, most of the royalties paid by oil companies to the government went into a special fund in London, where they were earmarked for such projects as schools and health clinics. But Deby unilaterally ended that arrangement, saying he needed more money for his security forces as rebellions flared and refugees poured across the border from Sudan. Wolfowitz responded on Jan. 6 by effectively blocking the government's access to the London fund. An interim accord in April, intended to last three months, freed some of that money. The new agreement could be the foundation of a more permanent arrangement and is an attempt to deal with additional taxes that the government is getting from the oil companies because of high petroleum prices. While about $400 million in royalties went into the London account from the start of production in 2003 through 2005, indirect taxes on higher-price oil  --  which weren't subject to any controls  --  will give the government an estimated $1.5 billion next year."28-Jul-06,"MALAWI (97%); AFRICA (90%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (79%)","  Former President Bakili Muluzi, left, was arrested on charges that he had diverted to his personal bank account $12 million in aid donated by foreign governments.

Mr. Mutharika then suspended the head of the government's Anti-Corruption Bureau. Ishmael Wadi, the director of public prosecutions, said the bureau had no one sufficiently senior to take over the case. Mr. Muluzi remains popular and, as leader of the opposition party, powerful. Analysts say members of his party in Parliament could delay passage of the budget, a step in Mr. Mutharika's drive to secure a promised $2.9 billion package in debt relief from Western donors."12-Aug-06,KENYA (98%),"A day after the World Bank's top official in Kenya said he had been shaken down for a bribe during a traffic stop, the Kenyan authorities said nothing improper happened and accused the official on Friday of acting ''above the law.'' According to a Kenyan police report, Colin Bruce, the World Bank's country director for Kenya, who has crusaded against corruption, was approaching downtown Nairobi on Thursday afternoon when police officers stopped his driver for speeding. The officers said that according to their radar gun, Mr. Bruce's car was going 72 miles an hour, more than twice the legal limit. The police officers began to write a ticket, but when they asked the driver to post the equivalent of $54 for bail, Mr. Bruce accused them of trying to solicit a bribe and refused to cooperate, the police report said. He then called the head of Kenya's anti-corruption squad on his cellphone. Several other motorists who had also been stopped for speeding joined the protest and started yelling at the police, quickly drawing a scene of reporters and onlookers. Kenya is notorious for corruption, especially among police officers, and the government recently established the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission to respond to complaints. Mr. Bruce has spoken out many times about the level of graft here. Earlier this year, the World Bank delayed more than $250 million in loans to Kenya, saying the government was not doing enough to end corruption. A team of anti-corruption officers soon arrived at the roadside where Mr. Bruce was arguing with the police and arrested five policemen and drove them away in a van. Police officials said they were humiliated by what happened. ''It is totally unacceptable to interrupt a police operation like this,'' Gideon M. Kibunjah, a spokesman for the Kenyan Police, said Friday. Mr. Kibunjah said the policemen had not been asking for a bribe but for a standard amount of cash bail to ensure that the ticketed motorists would show up in court. ''It was perfectly legal,'' he said. ''We give receipts and everything.'' He said Mr. Bruce had insulted the policemen and should not act ''above the law.'' The police department also issued a stiffly worded statement that said, ''the reason for his displeasure was that the police had the audacity to stop his car.'' The statement went on to commend the policemen for ''their professionalism in the face of blatant provocation.'' Mr. Bruce did not return phone calls for comment."8-Sep-06,NIGERIA (95%); UNITED STATES (79%); NIGER (79%); AFRICA (79%),"President Olusegun Obasanjo sent the Senate a report by a state anti-corruption agency accusing his deputy of diverting millions of dollars in public funds to private business concerns, officials said Thursday. Vice President Atiku Abubakar rejected the report as a ""cocktail of lies"" and threatened to present lawmakers with 127 impeachable offenses against Obasanjo, including milking the state oil company of funds for political activities. The open warfare between the two politicians raised the chances of chaos in the run-up to elections, scheduled for April, in a country already facing an armed insurrection in the oil-producing Niger Delta, religious strife, political assassinations and widespread violent crime. ""It could trigger a political meltdown, government gridlock, a delay in the ruling party's primaries,"" said Sebastian Spio-Garbrah, an analyst with Eurasia Group, a consulting firm. The two men have waged a low-intensity power struggle for years. It escalated into a public feud during a failed campaign to rewrite the constitution to allow Obasanjo to run for a third term. Abubakar opposed the effort, and the Senate rejected the amendment in May. The elections next year should mark the first democratic handover of power in Africa's most populous country since independence from Britain in 1960. The anti-corruption agency's report details what it said was the authorization by Abubakar of millions of dollars in payments from the Petroleum Technology Development Fund to private business concerns. Abubakar's spokesman, Garba Shehu, said Abubakar plans to ask the Senate to investigate what he called 127 impeachable offenses by Obasanjo, including the use of ""phony accounts"" for the president's political activities funded by the state oil company. The vice president, like the president and state governors, is constitutionally immune from prosecution. But he could be disqualified from running for the presidency if he is indicted for corruption. Abubakar divides much of his time between Nigeria and Potomac, Md. An ongoing FBI investigation is looking into whether Rep. William J. Jefferson (D-La.) bribed Abubakar to help land a lucrative telecommunications contract in Nigeria. Abubakar  and Jefferson  have denied any wrongdoing."21-Oct-07,AFRICA (98%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (94%); CHINA (79%); ASIA (79%); EASTERN ASIA (79%); INDIA (79%); ZIMBABWE (79%),"The economies of sub-Saharan Africa, home to some of the most extreme and pervasive poverty in the world, will grow at a healthy pace next year, International Monetary Fund economists said yesterday. The news came at the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank this weekend, where leaders of the latter group are trying to raise money to fight poverty on the continent -- and grappling with the difficulty of trying to help some of the world's poorest people, many of whom live in countries with considerably corrupt governance. The fund's projections have African nations growing more slowly than emerging East Asia, but on the right track; its economists expect 6 percent growth in total output forecast this year and nearly 7 percent growth in 2008. Inflation has been contained across most of Africa, excluding Zimbabwe (where there has been hyperinflation recently), according to the fund's annual regional economic outlook, released yesterday. ""African economic policies are far better than in the past,"" Abdoulaye Bio-Tchan, African development director of the IMF, said of the improvement. ""Deficits are going down, inflation is going down, and as I suggested, the growth rate is picking up based on those strong policies."" Robert B. Zoellick, president of the World Bank, is trying to raise nearly $40 billion over the coming months for a fund that will pay for development projects for the world's 81 poorest nations, most of them in Africa. But raising the money is likely to be challenging. Many nations are facing tight budgets and wish to control their aid activities themselves rather than turn money over to the World Bank as an intermediary. Developing countries such as China and India are home to hundreds of millions of very poor individuals, but those countries can handily raise money for development projects through private capital. The countries that don't have access to private capital markets and thus most need help from an organization like the World Bank tend to have unstable or corrupt governments. But donors are wary of funding projects in which big chunks of the money may get siphoned off. Zoellick's predecessor, Paul D. Wolfowitz, made fighting corruption his top priority, and an outside commission chaired by former Federal Reserve chairman Paul A. Volcker recommended an overhaul of the World Bank's fraud-fighting unit in a report last month. Zoellick said last week that  the bank's role must go beyond financing roads, dams and other infrastructure. ""Many people think that our role is just the traditional World Bank of the '60s, of project finance,"" he said. ""Our real role is helping to create the markets, the intermediation, the institutions, so these things go on long beyond us."" There is little that the World Bank can do for regimes that are corrupt at the very top, said Raymond Fisman, a Columbia University economist who studies corruption. ""If the top guy in the country isn't buying into it, there's not much hope,"" he said. ""But if there is genuine interest in reform, the World Bank can play a very good role in figuring out how best to implement anti-corruption reform."" Nigeria offers an example of the challenge. A major oil exporter, the nation has been enriched in recent years by high energy prices. The IMF said yesterday that it expects the Nigerian economy to grow 8 percent next year. But it also has a legacy of being one of the most corrupt nations in the world, under a succession of military leaders. (It now is controlled by civilians). Even if the IMF growth projection is correct, its gross domestic product per person would be only $1,136, and about 35 percent of its population lived in extreme poverty in 2004. Transparency International, a nonprofit organization, ranks Nigeria the 32nd most corrupt nation out of 180, with officials routinely requiring bribes in exchange for routine public services. Speaking to reporters yesterday, Nigerian Finance Minister Shamsuddeen Usman said that the nation has made steady progress eradicating corruption. For example, he said, he and other leaders are now publicly disclosing their assets, a check against bribes and the siphoning of oil wealth. ""I think the issue of corruption is becoming less and less,"" Usman said. Then, slightly misstating the nation's corruption ranking from Transparency International, he said, ""Our last rating was that we were the 38th most corrupt nation. That is still 37 steps better than when we were ranked the most corrupt."""4-Jan-08,NIGERIA (96%),"JOHANNESBURG, Jan. 3 -- The government of Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua has pressured its most prominent anti-corruption official to step down, weeks after the arrest of a powerful former governor from the ruling party on corruption charges. The official, Nuhu Ribadu, said in an interview Thursday that he had not decided whether to resign. But a top official on his Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was unlikely Ribadu would be able to keep his position. ""There's no way he can stay at the commission,"" the official said. Ribadu's departure has long been rumored after years in which he has targeted some of the most allegedly corrupt officials in one of the world's most corrupt nations. Among his targets have been several former governors prominent in Yar'Adua's ruling party, including James Ibori of Delta state, who was arrested last month on corruption and money-laundering charges. The head of Nigeria's police force, Mike Okiro, announced last week that Ribadu had been ordered to attend a year-long training course at the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies, a research group in the city of Jos. Yar'Adua spokesman Olusegun Adeniyi, in an interview published Thursday in the Guardian newspaper in Nigeria, said the president supported Ribadu's reassignment. ""I believe in Ribadu and the work he is doing,"" Adeniyi said. But he criticized what he said was a ""propaganda blitz"" from Ribadu's office in the aftermath of Okiro's announcement. ""It's the timing that's most distressing. One of the biggest fishes in the corruption net had just been nabbed,"" said Wole Soyinka, a Nobel laureate in literature and outspoken critic of government misdeeds. Soyinka called Ribadu ""a bulldog"" who had inspired confidence and trust among Nigerians. ""A lot of damage has been done by his removal,"" he said. Corruption has dogged Nigeria since the massive surge of oil production in the 1970s, when billions of dollars in profits began enriching a relatively small but powerful elite. The country consistently ranks among the world's worst in measures of poverty, development and health. April's national elections, in which outgoing President Olusegun Obasanjo used his ruling party's machinery to help elect Yar'Adua as his handpicked successor, were marked by violence, ballot-stuffing and other irregularities. Nigerian and international observers said the results failed to represent the will of voters. Ibori, the former governor, was among the leading financial supporters of Yar'Adua's campaign, according to reports. Some observers have said they were convinced after Yar'Adua's first months in office that he was determined to bring a more ethical style of politics to Nigeria. The fate of Ribadu in recent months has been viewed as a test of Yar'Adua's resolve to break with the country's corrupt past. ""For all its problems, the EFCC has really been the only government institution that has been trying to hold wealthy, powerful ruling-party politicians to account for all of the many crimes that they have been accused of,"" said Chris Albin-Lackey, a Human Rights Watch investigator."5-Jan-08,NIGERIA (96%),"JOHANNESBURG, Jan. 4 -- Nigerian anti-corruption official Nuhu Ribadu agreed late Thursday to demands that he relinquish his post to take a training course, but he left open the possibility of returning later in the year. The move means that Ribadu will soon give up control of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, an agency that he has turned into a potent but controversial weapon against official corruption in a nation where politicians for years have acted with impunity. It also appears to end the standoff, at least for now, between Ribadu and the ruling party of President Umaru Yar'Adua, which had brought intense pressure against him to step aside in the weeks since he arrested former Delta state governor James Ibori on charges of corruption and money laundering. Mike Okiro, head of Nigeria's police force, ordered Ribadu last week to leave his job as head of the crimes commission to take a course at a government research organization. ""I intend to go to the course,"" Ribadu said in a brief telephone interview Friday. The move provoked protest from civil society and rights groups that contended it was an attempt by Yar'Adua's party to sideline Ribadu. The issue, which also prompted concern among U.S. and other international officials, took on added prominence at a time when Yar'Adua is attempting to consolidate power after April elections that observers called severely flawed. Ribadu initially resisted pressure to leave his post, but a senior member of his office, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said comments from a Yar'Adua spokesman published Thursday morning made clear that the president wanted him to take the training course. Ribadu issued a statement Thursday night saying he ""wishes to seize this opportunity to assure Mr. President, the leadership of the Nigeria Police and indeed, all patriotic Nigerians, of his absolute loyalty and dedication to the service of our fatherland. . . . As a loyal public servant, Nuhu Ribadu has no problem with the decision of Mr. President on the recommendation of the Inspector General of Police, to send him on a self-improvement course of study."" The course is scheduled to run through November. Ribadu declined to comment on whether he expected to return to the job after the course, but the official from his office said such a move is now possible."22-Jan-08,KENYA (98%); AFRICA (94%); RWANDA (92%); UKRAINE (92%); SUDAN (79%); SIERRA LEONE (79%); SOMALIA (79%); UGANDA (79%); LIBERIA (79%),"Blurry  video of a policeman beating a demonstrator; a photograph of angry slum-dwellers storming a food depot; headlines featuring the word ""violence."" That, more or less, sums up the news from Kenya, or at least the news that has filtered into the general consciousness over the past few weeks. Unless you were paying very close attention, you were probably tempted, as I was at first, to dismiss these events as yet more evidence of Africa's ungovernability. Uganda, Rwanda, Liberia, Somalia, Sudan, Sierra Leone; tribal enmity plus poverty equals violence; another country evolving into a ""failed state."" Doesn't it prove, once again, that Africa is an exception to all of the rules about global development, democratization, ""progress""? Actually, it doesn't. In fact, the closer one looks at Kenya, the less exceptional Africa seems. What was most striking to me about the violence in Kenya in recent weeks was not how much the country resembles Rwanda but, rather, how much it resembles, say, Ukraine in 2004 or South Korea in the 1980s. Perhaps the real story here is not, as one headline had it, about ""The Demons That Still Haunt Africa"" but about how Africa is no different from anywhere else. I am exaggerating here, somewhat, to make a point. Of course Kenya is special, as all countries are special, and of course there are some notably bloody Kenyan ethnic conflicts. The Kikuyu tribe, which constitutes about a fifth of Kenya's population, has dominated the country's politics and economics since independence -- and is profoundly resented for it. Among other things, the disturbances of recent weeks have included a wave of attacks on the Kikuyu sections of a Nairobi slum, and cross-tribal violence, with the Luo, in the Rift Valley. But step back a few paces,  and look at the broader picture. The immediate cause of the current unrest was not ancient ethnic hatred. The immediate cause was political. As happened in Ukraine, an election was held and one of the candidates appears to have stolen it. This was no piece of subtle fakery, nor did it involve anything so legalistic as a supreme court. On the contrary, with television cameras rolling, Kenyan paramilitary police stormed the conference center where votes were being counted -- and where the challenger, Raila Odinga, was said to be ahead of the incumbent, President Mwai Kibaki -- and expelled journalists and foreign observers. Soon afterward, an election official emerged to declare Kibaki the winner. Violence, apparently prepared well in advance, broke out immediately. There will be many explanations for the viciousness of what followed, but one of them, surely, is that this particular election fraud took place at a crucial moment in Kenyan history. As any student of revolution knows, popular uprisings generally take place not in the poorest countries but in those that have recently grown richer. In 2007, Kenya's economy grew 6.4 percent, a figure that will rapidly translate into fewer infant deaths, better nutrition and steadier jobs -- as well as increased ambitions, both personal and political. The more hope you have for the future, the more frustrating it is to be badly governed. And Kenya, famously, is extraordinarily badly governed. On the international ""perceived corruption"" rankings put together by the anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International, Kenya came in 150th, alongside Liberia and Sierra Leone, countries that are recovering from long-term civil wars. Year on year, Kenyans told the organization that they pay more and more bribes, too. Judges are for sale, lawmaking is arbitrary, government jobs are doled out according to ethnicity, not merit. No wonder there is widespread frustration. Thus there is nothing mysterious about the anger or the unrest, nothing that requires more Live Aid concerts or global outpourings of emotion, nothing especially ""African"" about Kenya's problems at all. Kenya needs a cleaner, more democratic, more rule-abiding government; it needs to eliminate the licenses and regulations that create opportunities for bribery; it needs to apply the law equally to all citizens. The West can help Kenya change these things by encouraging these values through the nature of the aid it gives and the strings attached to that aid. Ultimately, though, Kenya's political elite will have to decide what kind of country they want their children to live in. Yes, there are cultural factors, and, yes, Kenya is unique, but in the end politics, not culture, lies at the heart of the country's current problems. applebaumletters@washpost.com"19-May-08,AFRICA (96%); SOMALIA (92%); ZIMBABWE (79%),"Improvements in Africa Africa continues a long-term move toward political stability despite chaos in certain areas, a report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has concluded. Most African countries ""enjoy rising stability"" and several fragile states are stabilizing, it said. But civil strife persists in places such as Congo, Chad and Somalia. Trends include: More than  54 million Africans voted in 19 elections in 2007. Anti-corruption treaties were signed or ratified by  10 countries. Falling living standards caused unrest in nations such as  Zimbabwe and  South Africa."10-Jul-08,AFRICA (97%); UNITED STATES (94%); JAPAN (93%); ZIMBABWE (92%); SCOTLAND (90%); CHINA (79%); BRAZIL (79%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%); INDIA (79%); FRANCE (74%),"-- The United States and other members of the Group of Eight industrialized countries this week reiterated their commitment to doubling aid to Africa by 2010, seeking to assuage growing concern that they will miss the ambitious targets they set three years ago in Gleneagles, Scotland. They promised to create a global partnership of governments and nonprofits to address the food crisis that threatens to wipe out recent gains on the continent. They instituted new ""accountability"" procedures to ensure that wealthy countries fulfill their promises of aid to Africa. And they issued a sharply worded statement questioning the legitimacy of the government of President Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe. Much of the public focus of the summit was on global warming. On Tuesday,  G-8 leaders pledged efforts for a 50 percent reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions. On the same day, China, India, Brazil and other developing countries offered a competing plan, saying in a statement that not all countries could adopt such a target and that  developed countries must bear the burden as the biggest polluters. But how to address Africa's disease, poverty and political strife also ranked as an important theme at the gathering, which ended Wednesday. To emphasize these issues, the G-8 leaders had invited seven African heads of state and government to deliberate with them at the gathering, held at a Japanese resort. Africa has been a particular interest for President Bush, and his aides pronounced themselves pleased by progress at the summit, particularly new initiatives to train health workers, address tropical disease and provide 100,000 mosquito nets to help prevent malaria. With U.S. prodding, the G-8 also released reports detailing progress -- or lack of it -- that African countries have made in meeting health and anti-corruption goals. ""The lesson of this summit is that the emphasis is on implementation and on delivery,"" said British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. ""The emphasis is on turning words into action and making them far more concrete than ever they have been in the past."" Before leaving Japan for Washington, Bush also hailed ""progress on alleviating sickness in Africa."" He told reporters that ""we had a comprehensive agenda on helping those who are being affected by disease live healthy lives."" But many nonprofit and advocacy groups that sent people to observe the summit were more critical. Many expressed alarm over recent studies showing that the G-8 will probably miss its overall development goals unless it dramatically steps up efforts. The United States is not viewed as in danger of missing its target, but many activists think it is not doing enough relative to its wealth and size. There were also signs that the U.S. demand of accountability on aid assistance is rubbing some allies the wrong way. Fabrice Ferrier, who works for a nongovernmental group in France, said there is a belief the United States sometimes wants to measure only those areas in which it measures up well. Others saw the final G-8 language on accountability as relatively modest. Kel Currah of World Vision International, a Christian relief and development organization, applauded the U.S. initiative but said the bigger problem is that issues such as AIDS and food demand more money than the Group of Eight is willing to consider. ""Accountability is good,"" Currah said. But accountability for low aid numbers ""is not going to achieve the desired impact we are all looking for. We need more money."" One senior U.S. official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, acknowledged resistance from some countries over accountability but said this year is only a start. ""You might say it doesn't sound like a lot, but we think we worked to really embed the idea of G-8 accountability,"" he said. He noted that the G-8 for the first time spelled out a five-year time frame for spending $60 billion to combat AIDS and other diseases in Africa; last year, it promised the money but was vague about how long it would take to spend it. A more fundamental concern among activists and experts on Africa is whether the passion has disappeared from the G-8 effort on the continent. Several said the collective effort on addressing the food crisis was tepid, compared to the problem: While G-8 leaders said this week they have committed $10 billion to addressing the issue, the cost is likely to be much greater, according to Sam Worthington, president of InterAction, a coalition of U.S. nonprofits focused on world poverty. ""The good news is that the World Bank is beginning to try to lead a process, but to some extent we are treating the food crisis as an expansion of business-as-usual, as opposed to really leading a new effort,"" Worthington said in a telephone interview from Washington. One problem is expectations. Almost anything the G-8 does these days will pale compared with what was done at Gleneagles, where the industrialized countries committed themselves to dramatically increase assistance to Africa, said J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""In retrospect, the targets they agreed to at Gleneagles appear to have been a stretch,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""Several of the member governments simply are not going to meet their targets. The commitments were unrealistic with good intentions."" But, he said, concluding that there has been a serious failure misses ""the bigger story -- which is the core of African governments are doing pretty well."""23-Jul-09,NIGERIA (93%),"It's  a hip-hop music lover's constant dilemma: Brilliantly catchy, infectious music that just so happens to glorify crime, or -- in the case of Nigerian hip-hop -- cyberscamming. Olu Maintain (real name: Olumide Edwards Adegbolu), who's headlining Friday's African Summer Jam festival in Silver Spring, soared to fame on the back of his smash hit ""Yahoozee"" off his debut solo album ""Maintain Reloaded."" ""Yahoozee"" has remained an anthem at Nigerian parties around the world since. Although Maintain maintains that Yahoozee is just a dance -- nothing else -- most Nigerians understand it as a reference to the country's multibillion-dollar cyberscam industry. Many of the scam e-mails are sent from Yahoo accounts. You've seen the e-mails detailing money-laundering schemes. The heir whose $21 million inheritance is ""trapped"" in a Nigerian account, but if you let him temporarily deposit it into your account, a handsome cut is assured. Or the $2,000 check you received for the $900 bike you posted on Craigslist. Sorry for the mistake, if you could just send a money order for the $1,100 difference. Thanks. ""Yahoozee"" debuted in 2006 and gained steam over time, receiving numerous honors including Song of the Year at the 2008 Hip Hop World Awards. But ""Yahoozee"" detractors say the song's popularity is a national embarrassment. That kind of music, they say, feeds into Nigeria's reputation as a corrupt country where fraud is rampant. ""Yahoozee"" and similar songs ""will further worsen the current campaign against Internet scam by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and other anti-corruption agencies,"" argued Bayo Olupohunda, an activist and educator in Lagos, Nigeria, in a 2007 article posted on the Nigerian Times blog. ""The song is fast becoming a national anthem of sort among youths who now believe that some day, in the not too distant future, they will 'strike gold' or 'hammer' the elusive dollars from Monday to Friday (working days!) of intense 'hustling' doing night browsing and sending scam mails in a cybercafe,"" Olupohunda wrote. Maintain rejects the characterization of the song. ""It's just sad because I feel it's a very myopic way, a very noncreative view to analyze such a beautiful piece of art like the song 'Yahoozee,' "" Maintain says. ""If you listen to the lyrics it goes: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday  you work, you hustle. Saturday, Sunday you owe it to yourself to unwind. Champagne, Hennessy, Mot, you know, the good things in life. This from head to toe has nothing to do with being corrupt in any way. Hell no!"" Maintain, who was born to a Yoruba family in the small town of Ondo, Nigeria, and studied accounting before going into music, points to one of the low-budget music videos produced for the single. In it, the artist signs a record deal and celebrates by purchasing luxury cars and bottles of champagne. It's all about the Benjamins, baby. (Yes, those are actual lyrics in the song.) According to Maintain, the Yahoozee dance was already big before he recorded the song. He says his song in no way condones fraud, it's just a catchy song backed by a catchy dance. Certainly former secretary of state Colin Powell didn't make the connection between ""Yahoozee"" and Nigerian Internet fraud when he joined Olu Maintain onstage at the Africa Rising concert at Royal Albert Hall in London last October. Powell bobbed his stiff arms and tapped his polished shoes, occasionally chiming in on the mike during Maintain's performance of the song. Maintain says ""Yahoozee"" owes its popularity to the dance's attitude. ""I had the foresight [to realize that if I create a] song to this dance and do a video and I remodify it, I'm going to be seen as the creator and originator of the dance, and the ambassador of the dance. And that is what I did. ""It was one of the few good decisions I made in my life,"" he says. ""Trust me."" African Summer Jam DMV '09 featuring Olu Maintain and the Kentro Crew.

It has turned out in a way few expected. The draconian amputation sentences warned of by human rights activists and the religious oppression feared by Christians have mostly not come to pass. But neither has the utopia envisioned by backers of sharia law, who believed politicians' promises that it would end decades of corruption and pillaging by civilian and military rulers. The people are still poor and miserable, residents complain, and politicians are still rich. How the battles over sharia play out could have effects beyond Nigeria, a nation pivotal to West Africa's stability and viewed by the United States as key to stopping the spread of religious extremism in Africa. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is expected to discuss the issue with Nigerian leaders on a visit to the country this week. ""People want sharia. But not this kind of sharia,"" said Ahmad Al-Khanawy, 41, a reed-thin filmmaker, adding that the most visible signs of Islamic law are new censorship rules banning dancing and singing in movies made in Kannywood, as this city's film industry is known. Sharia-promoting politicians, he said, ""want to cover their failure by making noise about fighting immorality. That is it."" Nigeria's moderate form of sharia may not have delivered a Muslim revolution, but it has fueled a growing disillusionment that analysts say has weakened public faith in democracy -- and could, if unchecked, spark religious militancy. That prospect was highlighted last month when a radical Islamist sect called Boko Haram attacked security forces in northern Nigeria, triggering violence that killed more than 700 people. The group draws its members from the ranks of frustrated youths. ""Political space is so limited . . . that the disenchanted are finding little avenues for achieving change through dialogue and peaceful expression,"" said Nnamdi Obasi, West Africa analyst for the International Crisis Group. Reforms Missing Mark So far, analysts say, extremist groups such as Boko Haram remain small and do not have links to international terrorist organizations. In Kano, northern Nigeria's largest city, many say the bigger short-term danger is that people have begun to view this form of sharia -- and the democracy that brought it -- as just another broken political promise. Kano remains a sunbaked metropolis where electricity is fitful, child beggars swarm on street corners and goats graze in trash heaps. Many of the region's leaders have been accused of corruption, which plagues Nigeria. Against that backdrop, residents say, sharia reforms such as movie censorship and a ban on women riding motorbike taxis seem like window-dressing. ""Sharia is about justice. Where you have sharia, you have development,"" said Salisu Saidu, 32, standing amid the leather bags he sells in Kano's labyrinthine market. ""Nothing has changed. If one relied on tap water, one would die of thirst. We don't even talk of electricity."" Islam has dominated in this region on the edge of the Sahara for centuries, in a tenuous coexistence with the Christianity that is prevalent in more prosperous southern Nigeria. When Kano and 11 other northern states that had long applied Islamic law to civil cases adopted sharia for criminal matters, clashes broke out between Christians and Muslims. Early on, several sentences of death by stoning for female adulterers -- never carried out -- and the amputation of two men's hands for theft drew international condemnation. But this version of sharia turned out to be fairly temperate, reflecting local sensibilities and religious law's existence within a secular federal system. The harshest sentences imposed under the new system, which applies only to Muslims, garnered little public support. The efforts to ban women from motorbike taxis sparked protests, so veiled women still zip about Kano with their arms around male drivers. The federal government reined in the sharia police, known as the Hisbah, after they were accused of terrorizing people. Still, the Hisbah remain active. This year, they thwarted a planned protest by divorced Muslim women. Alongside politicians, they regularly smash bottles of liquor seized from trucks smuggling them into Kano's Christian neighborhood, where bars operate openly despite a state ban on alcohol sales. The Hisbah's actions have rankled Christian leaders. ""To us, sharia is a religious injunction laced around the strings of love, tolerance and respect for human dignity,"" said Tobias Michael Idika, 48, a Christian community leader, who on a recent day sat in a Kano hotel lobby and read from a letter he had written to local officials to protest the actions. He looked up and shook his head: ""Now we are being used as sacrificial lambs."" No Turning Back All this has added up to a mishmash that looks little like the progress sharia supporters had envisaged. In their version, the tenets of Islam would guide leaders to care for the downtrodden, use resources wisely and punish criminals both powerful and lowly. But few officials in sharia-governed states have been convicted of corruption, although critics point to their grand houses as evidence that wealth is not being spread. ""If anybody comes to me and asks for my support on the promise of implementing sharia, I wouldn't even vote for him,"" said Abba Adam Koki, an imam who served on a government sharia board for two years but said he quit after deciding that officials were committed only to preserving their power. ""I prefer someone to come and tell me what programs he has for the people."" Government officials say they are doing their best and insist there can be no turning back from Islamic law, though they concede that a full sharia state in multi-faith Nigeria is impossible. Sule Ya'u Sule, Kano state's spokesman, said the governor has established several agencies to oversee the spread of Islamic principles, including an anti-corruption unit and a branch that collects alms to pay the hospital bills of thousands of poor people each year. The government created 40,000 jobs in the four years prior to 2007 and has curbed prostitution and drinking, he said. The challenges, Sule said, are that the secular federal police who still patrol Kano are unwilling to cooperate with the Hisbah and that the government does not gives states enough money. Officials require decent clothing, cars and houses, he said, but that does not mean they are corrupt. ""The federal government only gives you a little amount every month. And it is that amount that it expects you to use to develop the state,"" Sule said. ""This money is not enough to finish this work and distribute it to the needy."" On a recent day outside the Islamic court in the northern city of Kaduna, two businessmen lamented that even the heart of Nigeria's Islamic law revolution -- its courts -- had turned out as sluggish as any. In the turquoise-walled courtroom, prosecutors scolded the judge for postponing several long-standing cases on the docket, including an inheritance dispute and the case of a woman seeking to divorce her husband on grounds that their seven-year-old marriage had not been consummated. Muhammed Bello, 45, and Yushau Inuwa, 28, were there to see whether a friend accused of theft a year ago -- and badly beaten by the Hisbah, they said -- would finally face trial. The courts were inefficient, they said, and the government had not delivered on what they referred to as their constitutional rights to better roads, schools and health care. ""It's a double tragedy,"" Inuwa said, though he insisted that the answer to his frustration was not violence. ""We need better leaders."""25-Oct-09,KENYA (97%); GHANA (94%); AFRICA (94%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%),"Accompanying the fanfare of President Obama's visit to Ghana in July was a chorus of well-founded praise for that country's functioning democracy. The U.S. president pointed to his host country as a shining example, while warning other nations on the continent that ""Africa doesn't need strongmen, it needs strong institutions.""  Political pundits and the media reinforced Obama's message, holding up Ghana as Africa's success story. Not so long ago, Ghana shared the limelight with Kenya, the country of Obama's paternal past. But the vote-tampering and widespread ethnic violence that marred the 2007 Kenyan elections left observers shaking their heads, wondering how the idyll of East Africa could have gone so wrong, so quickly. A well-functioning, multiparty government buoyed by an impressive 6 percent annual growth rate had made for a potent combination in the post-colonial dream world. The blurring of fantasy and reality, however, was laid bare in the smoldering rubble of election violence that left some 1,500 Kenyans dead and at least 300,000 internally displaced. Journalist Michela Wrong provides a very important and illuminating account of Kenya's present-day political and economic morass. On one level, ""It's Our Turn to Eat"" reads like a John le Carr novel as it traces the cloak-and-dagger maneuverings of Kenya's political bosses, and the heroic but futile attempts of John Githongo -- the government's internal, anti-corruption watchdog, and the protagonist of Wrong's account -- to stymie them. On a deeper and much richer level, the book is an analysis of how and why Kenya descended into political violence more than a year and a half ago. For Wrong, the insidious bedfellows of corruption and tribalism inhabit nearly every sphere of Kenyan existence. At the upper echelons of government, members of parliament connived to defraud the country of some $750 million through the notorious Anglo-Leasing scheme; at the lower levels of society, the ordinary Kenyan doles out on average 16 bribes a month to government agents simply to get by. These factors, as Wrong points out, have been present in Kenya since the inauguration of the country's first independent government in 1963, despite the rather rosy and misplaced image that characterized the nation, at least in the Western media, for decades. First, under the leadership of Jomo Kenyatta, the Kikuyu, Kenya's ethnic majority,  benefited disproportionately from the state's spoils. Kenyatta surrounded himself with a coterie of loyal ethnic supporters who systematically excluded non-Kikuyu from participating in their quest for power and ill-gotten wealth. Subsequently, when Daniel T. arap Moi took power in 1978, the new president continued with the tribally based corruption. Only this time, Moi, who came from the ethnic-minority Kalenjin of western Kenya, redirected the flow of wealth and power to his tribal base of supporters. For the Kalenjin and other closely related tribes, it was their turn to eat. It was Githongo -- a Western-educated, physically imposing and exceedingly shrewd man -- who was to herald the literal and symbolic end to this vicious cycle of corruption and ethnic favoritism. When Mwai Kibaki, a Kikuyu, took presidential power in 2002, he declared his election a mandate for reform and appointed the young Githongo, also a Kikuyu, to root out the old bogies that had undermined Kenya's progress. It wasn't long, though, before Githongo's starry eyes cleared, only to find his revered mentor, Kibaki, knee-deep in the corruption game, with a supporting cast of legislators aiding and abetting theft from the state's coffers. With much drama, Githongo eventually fled Kenya, taking with him piles of documents and secretly taped conversations. He landed on the London doorstep of Wrong, an old acquaintance. Given this personal connection, Wrong is notably self-aware of her position as both author and partial subject of her own book. Indeed, her  personal involvement scarcely compromises her excellent analysis of Kenya's twin evils; rather, she deftly points to the fact that corruption and tribalism are not endemic just to Africa, but inhabit the contemporary, worldwide landscape, and that complicity reaches to all corners of the globe as well. If the old-boy system is not an African artifact, and if undemocratic processes have no boundaries -- many a Kenyan will snicker at the mention of a hanging chad -- how then does Wrong make sense of the localized events in Kenya? By ""probing the roots of a dysfunctional African nation"" and its British colonial legacy, as well as Kenya's more recent entanglements with the likes of the World Bank and Britain's Department for International Development, Wrong takes a decidedly Paul Wolfowitz-like stand. That is, political systems are at the heart of the problem and must be reformed if there is any hope for the alleviation of poverty -- and not just in Kenya. It's difficult to argue against Wrong on this point, though the roots and solutions to Kenya's problems are far more embedded in the country's past than she suggests. Colonial Kenya -- with its white tribe of settlers and administrators, economic monopolies and perpetuation of African tribalism, and a governor who ruled with highly centralized powers and a posse of loyal underlings to support him -- bears an uncanny resemblance to the country today. Moreover, while Wrong praises Britain's former  highest-ranking ambassador to Kenya, High Commissioner Edward Clay, and his anti-corruption stance, she fails to mention that, while Clay was making his strongest denunciations of corruption, the full impact of Britain's colonial violence and coverups was finally being disclosed in Kenya. Britain's colonial legacy has undermined its moral authority and continues to influence processes in Kenya, no matter how complicit Africans have been in perpetuating corruption and tribalism. The historical phenomenon of colonialism and its long-term impact vary across the continent, making the trajectory of a former settler colony such as Kenya distinct from that of Ghana, and many other African nations, for that matter. If strongmen are to be eliminated and institutions reformed -- as both Obama and Wrong urge -- then the historical differences among various African countries, and the ways in which these differences inform and shape present-day governing structures and cultures, must be thoroughly understood.

It means ""something small"" in Swahili, and it refers to the bribes Kenyans pay minor bureaucrats, such as police officers and utility company employees, to make life easier. For decades, Kenyans had only their relatives and friends to complain to. Until now. A new Web site - I Paid a Bribe - is allowing Kenyans to share their experiences with bribery. Activists say the site could become a potent weapon in the fight against graft in one of the world's most corrupt nations. ""It brings a human face to corruption,"" said Samuel Kimeu, executive director of Transparency International-Kenya, an anti-corruption watchdog group. ""When people tell their stories the way they do on the Web site, it has the potential to catalyze action."" Drawing some inspiration from the Arab Spring uprisings, activism appears to be on the rise here and in many other corners of sub-Saharan Africa. Last year, protests erupted in Uganda and Malawi over bad governance and other issues. More recently, Nigerians have demonstrated against corruption and rising fuel prices, and activists in Senegal have rallied against President Abdoulaye Wade's bid for a third term. ""I'm calling what's happening in Kenya the 'Bribe Spring,' "" said Antony Ragui, the Web site's 36-year-old founder. ""People are fed up with corruption and the government. The real goal ofI Paid a Bribe is to harness the collective energy of Kenyans. I am trying to create a network of Kenyans who are anti-corruption -minded."" Ragui, a financial services consultant with an MBA from the University of California at Berkeley, said he returned to Kenya in 2007 to find a society that revolved around corruption. Out of 182 nations, only 28 are more corrupt than Kenya, according to Transparency International. ""I was tired of people whining about corruption. I wanted to do something about it,"" Ragui said. One day, Ragui read a magazine article about an Indian Web site - Ipaidabribe.com - that was fighting corruption. He contacted the site, which agreed to provide the software to start a similar effort in Kenya, its first spinoff. Launched last month, Ragui's site is divided into three sections. One part collects stories about bribes paid, listing the amount as well as where and when the incident occurred. Another section collects details about people who refused to pay bribes. And the third provides a forum for instances of honesty, when a bribe was not required. More than 400 bribes have been reported; the total amount paid is nearly 9 million Kenyan shillings - or about $110,000. One contributor wrote about ""our depressing first bribe,"" when she and her husband were stopped for an illegal U-turn late at night. The police officer asked her husband to step out of their car and ""took everything in his wallet."" ""Later, my colleague said, 'Never stop for a policeman on foot - they can't catch you!' "" the woman wrote. Others described paying police officers to investigate robberies and bribing bureaucrats to speed up licenses and passports. In many cases, police were accused of intimidating victims into paying bribes, going so far as to make up infractions. Contributors proudly provide advice on how to avoid paying bribes, which usually involves a lot of patience and bargaining. One person wrote about refusing to pay off an electricity company worker for reconnecting the power. ""I just told him I could stay in the dark for the whole weekend before he even saw a coin,"" the commenter wrote. ""I also threatened to call his boss. He reconnected me, which he should have done instead of aggravating me."" To prevent abuse and possible legal problems, the site's software blocks the names of bribe payers and recipients. The most vital information, Ragui said, is where, when and to which government body bribes are paid. T.R. Raghunandan, a spokesman for the Indian site, said activists in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, the Philippines and Nigeria have asked how to start sites. ""Working with Antony was very instructing for us,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""It gives us confidence to work with other countries. Our goal is to create a worldwide source of fighting corruption."" Ragui said he has met withthe World Bank and other organizations, seeking funds to expand and publicize the Web site. He wants to add a function that would allow victims to send text-message complaints to the site, enabling Kenyans to report corruption in real time. With the cost of living rising in Kenya, he hopes more people will reject paying bribes and fight the system. ""If I can change one department in the government,I can die a happy man,"" he said. raghavans@washpost.com More world news coverage: - U.S. weighs tactics shift in Afghanistan - Egypt to prosecute Americans in probe - Russia and China veto U.N. resolution on Syria - Read more headlines from around the world Big Firms Accused of Bribery in African Dam Project It's a tale involving millions of dollars allegedly funneled into Swiss bank accounts by giant international companies competing to build one of the biggest infrastructure projects under construction in the world. The companies stand accused of paying bribes to win lucrative dam-building and engineering contracts on the Highlands Water Project in the southern African kingdom of Lesotho. While bribery in Third World construction projects hardly rates as stunning news, the allegations involve big-name European multinationals, notably ABB Ltd., a Swiss-Swedish firm with about $ 31 billion in revenue last year. Moreover, the project is partly backed by the World Bank, which has recently embarked on an anti-corruption drive. And the case may prove embarrassing to the bank because its new anti-bribery guidelines won't necessarily apply. The allegations, spelled out in a charge sheet that Lesotho authorities filed July 28 against Masupha Sole, the former head of the project, contain highly specific data on payments totaling about $ 2 million that 12 companies, mostly European, allegedly provided for deposit in Sole's bank accounts in South Africa and Switzerland. A Swiss court has also found evidence indicating that the bribes were paid, according to the Swiss newspaper Sonntags Zeitung. The list of companies ""reads like a Who's Who of the dam-building industry,"" said Patrick McCully, campaigns director of the International Rivers Network, a California-based environmental activist group that opposes dams. According to the charges, ABB paid Sole about $ 40,000. Spie Batignolles of France allegedly provided about $ 120,000, Impregilo of Italy allegedly paid $ 250,000, ED Zueblin of Germany allegedly chipped in about $ 447,000, and Acres International of Canada allegedly paid about $ 188,000. Several of the companies, contacted by The Washington Post, denied paying bribes to win contracts in Lesotho. ""No payment for whatever sum at whatever time has been made by Impregilo"" to Sole, said Romano Allione, an official of the Italian company. John Fox, a spokesman for ABB, said: ""We have been working with the Lesotho authorities, supporting their investigation. About allegations, I can't comment at this point."" But some corruption experts said that if the accusations pan out, the firms should be ""debarred"" by the World Bank--that is, prohibited from bidding on projects funded by the bank, a major source of financing for dams in developing countries. A little more than two years ago, the bank cracked down on bribery after a speech by its president, James D. Wolfensohn, denouncing the ""cancer of corruption"" and its corrosive impact on poor countries. The bank, which has 181 member countries, adopted guidelines pledging to ""declare a firm ineligible, either indefinitely or for a stated period of time, to be awarded a bank-financed contract"" if the firm is found to have ""engaged in corrupt or fraudulent practices in competing for, or in executing, a bank-financed contract."" So far, the bank has debarred nine relatively small companies, but it's far from certain that the companies accused of bribery in the Lesotho case will suffer punishment by the bank even if the charges are proven. That's because, although the bank was heavily involved in formulating the project, it lent only about $ 100 million of the estimated $ 2.4 billion cost, for objectives such as engineering design and access roads--and the companies listed in the indictment may be able to avoid debarment by claiming that they won contracts for other parts of the project. Indeed, the World Bank's official statement on the Lesotho scandal suggests as much. ""We eagerly await the outcome of the court case, at which point the World Bank will decide on further steps,"" said Junaid Ahmad, the bank's deputy resident representative in South Africa. ""We will conduct an internal investigation to ensure that Bank policies and procedures have been followed on the components of the project that have been financed by the World Bank."" The bank's acting general counsel, Daoud Khairallah, said yesterday: ""We cannot eradicate corruption in all situations where we have no control. . . . If any of our funds have been tampered with, yes, we can debar. But not if it's something that we didn't have any control over."" Jeremy Pope, executive director of Transparency International, an organization dedicating to fighting corruption, voiced incredulity that the companies might get off the hook. ""It's a project the World Bank was involved in, and logic says--if you're bribing, you're bribing; and if you're unfit to be bidding for business, you're unfit."" In any event, he said, ""when these companies go bidding for public sector business, their competitors will use this and say, 'If you do a deal with that lot, everyone will think you've been bribed.' "" The bank's anti-corruption efforts are part of a broader drive against bribery in the industrialized world. After considerable agitation by the United States, which made it a crime in 1977 for U.S. firms to bribe foreign officials, the 29 wealthy countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ratified a convention in December 1997 pledging to criminalize foreign bribery. But less than half of the nations have passed the necessary laws, and in any case the alleged bribery of Sole took place before the convention was adopted. The Lesotho project is located in a country of about 2 million, entirely surrounded by South Africa, that is rated as one of the world's poorest, with almost no natural resources other than water. The project, which includes a dam more than 600 feet high, provides water to an industrial region of South Africa and provides employment to Lesotho, most of whose workers must find jobs in South Africa. But the International Rivers Network charges that the project has disrupted communities and led to the establishment of squatters' camps, replete with prostitution and AIDS, in once-remote mountain communities. The group also asserts that massive bribery is predictable in such projects--and notes that some of the companies named in the Lesotho indictment have figured in other corruption scandals involving dams.

The Securities and Exchange Commission charged the three executives Friday with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act from 2003 through 2007. They are former chief executive Mark Jackson, former controller and head of internal audits Thomas O'Rourke, and James Ruehlen, who is the director and division manager of Noble's Nigerian subsidiary. O'Rourke settled the charges by agreeing to pay a $35,000 fine. He neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. Jackson and Ruehlen are disputing the charges. Noble, which has operations worldwide and an office in Sugar Land, Tex., was charged with criminal and civil foreign-bribery violations in November 2010 as part of what the government called a ""sweep"" of the oil services industry. The company cooperated with government investigators and wasn't prosecuted. It agreed to pay about $5.6 million in restitution and a $2.6 million criminal fine. The SEC's charges are the latest action in the government's efforts to combat overseas corruption in international business. A number of U.S. and foreign companies have been charged in recent years with violating the anti-corruption law, which makes it illegal to bribe foreign government officials or company executives to secure or retain business. In its lawsuit filed in Houston, the SEC said that Jackson and Ruehlen bribed Nigerian customs officials to process phony paperwork showing that Noble's oil rigs were moved in and out of the country even when they weren't. The purpose was to save the company substantial costs of exporting rigs from Nigeria and then re-importing them with new permits. O'Rourke helped approve the bribes and allowed the payments to be falsely recorded as legitimate operating expenses for Noble, according to the SEC. ""These executives knowingly authorized and paid foreign officials to process false documents, and they consciously concealed the scheme from Noble's audit committee,"" Gerald Hodgkins, an associate director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in a statement. Jackson's attorney, David Krakoff, called the SEC's allegations ""baseless."" He said the former Noble chief executive ""will vigorously defend himself in court, where the evidence will show what the SEC already knows, that at all times Mr. Jackson acted in good faith at Noble. ""He looks forward to clearing his good name in this proceeding,"" Krakoff said in a statement. F. Joseph Warin, an attorney representing Ruehlen, said it was his client who initially raised the issue within the company. Ruehlen ""fully cooperated throughout the investigation and always acted in an ethical and transparent manner,"" Warin's statement said. ""The claims against Mr. Ruehlen are wrong and they will be proven so at trial."" - Associated Press Russia Putin opponent winskey mayoral election An anti-corruption crusader has won a landslide victory in a mayoral election in a major Russian city, dealing a painful blow to the ruling party and energizing the beleaguered opposition. Yevgeny Urlashov won 70 percent of Sunday's vote in Yaroslavl, a city of about 590,000 some 150 miles east of Moscow, easily defeating the acting mayor, who was the candidate of president-elect Vladimir Putin's United Russia party. Urlashov's victory reflects growing public irritation with official corruption and social inequality. And it gives new hope to Russia's opposition, which has struggled to maintain momentum after Putin won a third presidential term last month. Opposition leaders have urged their supporters to focus on local elections, and Urlashov's victory is likely to bolster that strategy. Urlashov, a 45-year-old lawyer who was a member of the municipal council, won the race after a campaign heavily slanted in favor of his rival, who received blanket positive coverage from local television. Police also raided Urlashov's headquarters. - Associated Press Colombia Guerrilla group frees 10 captives Colombia's main rebel group on Monday freed what it says were its last 10 military and police captives, returning the men to their families after at least 12 years spent in jungle prisons. The release of the six police officers and four soldiers highlighted efforts by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia to seek peace talks. It is Latin America's oldest and most potent guerrilla band, and it has been weakened by Colombia's U.S.-backed military. Flown to Bogota aboard a loaned Brazilian air force helicopter, the freed captives waved jubilantly. They were escorted from the helicopter by nurses to waiting relatives for reunions behind closed doors. Some jumped for joy on the runway. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC, had announced Monday's liberation on Feb. 26 in tandem with a halt in ransom kidnappings as a revenue source. - Associated Press Saudi Arabia Girls may be allowedto play school sports Saudi Arabia is considering letting girls play sports at school, a senior education official was quoted as saying Monday, in what would represent a relaxation of rules governing women's lives in the conservative Islamic kingdom. Under Saudi Arabia's strict Islamic legal system, powerful clerics have issued religious rulings against female participation in sports. Women must receive the permission of a male ""guardian"" to travel abroad, work and have some elective surgery. They are also barred from driving. After King Abdullah moved last year to bring women into the country's political process, however, there have been some signs that authorities may allow sportswomen to compete internationally and make it easier for girls to exercise. - Reuters Mali West African groupimposes sanctions The body representing West African nations on Monday imposed severe financial sanctions on Mali after a 72-hour deadline elapsed and soldiers who recently seized power in a coup failed to fully restore constitutional order. The Economic Community of West African States held an emergency meeting in the capital of Senegal on Monday. After the three-hour meeting, the chairman of the bloc, Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara, said the sanctions would go into effect immediately. They include the closing of the borders with Mali and the freezing of the nation's account in the regional central bank, measures that are likely to suffocate the economy of this poor and landlocked nation. Mali imports its petroleum products from neighboring Ivory Coast, and with the border closed, Mali is likely to run out of gasoline. It could also plunge the nation of more than 15 million into darkness, because the electricity grid is partially powered by diesel during the hot season, when hydropower is ineffective because of the low water table. - Associated Press Hungarian president quits after plagiarism report: Hungary's parliament has accepted the resignation of President Pal Schmitt, who announced that he was stepping down after losing his doctorate in a plagiarism scandal.

But these are no ordinary tourists. Salwa Bugaighis and Amira Yahyaoui, two of nine female activists from around the world being feted in Washington this week, are deep in conversation about feminism and its frustrations in the aftermath of their countries' revolutions. Household names in their homelands, the dissidents - Bugaighis, one of the first women on Libya's transitional council, who resigned to protest the role's tokenism, and Yahyaoui, 27, Tunisia's leading anti-censorship blogger - will be honored Wednesday night at the Kennedy Center by the Vital Voices Global Partnership. The event is sort of  like the Oscars, but for the world's toughest women's rights activists. Along with six other female leaders, Bugaighis and Yahyaoui are on a Sunday evening bus tour of Washington attractions. The sightseeing is meant to get the honorees - who have heard about one another on blogs or through Facebook but have not met - out of hotel conference halls and give them a little bonding time. And it seems to be working. Fast friends, the visitors talk about how - despite the fact that women and men stood hand in hand during the Arab Spring protests - men sidelined the women almost immediately afterward. ""The question is how do we, as women, stand again?"" said Shatha al-Harazi, a 26-year-old reporter for theYemen Times who overheard the women from Libya and Tunisia. Al-Harazi, who has braces, could be mistaken for a teenager. But she was summoned to the presidential palace after her tweets called attention to Yemen's human rights abuses. She said that President Ali Abdullah Saleh should resign. ""Since I was in the fifth grade, I have always been questioning things,"" Harazi said as the tour van rumbled along Embassy Row. ""But men always want women to be this decoration, like you are this remote control that they can turn on and off. It took so much courage for Salwa to resign. To meet her is like spending time with your role model."" This year's ceremony brings together many of the female leaders who emerged during the Arab Spring. It also includes Mexican anti-corruption politician Ruth Zavaleta Salgado and Liberian girl-soldier rehabilitator Rosana Schaack, who observed the need when she was working as a nurse during the country's civil war. It has been the kind of week when Samoan entrepreneur Adi Tafuna'i, who works with female farmers to sell the country's organic coconut oil to the Body Shop, could be seen discussing the power of women in business with Samar Minallah Khan, a documentary filmmaker from Pakistan who focuses on her country's discrimination against women. ""It does feel like a bit of girl bonding, but with superwomen, since each of the women have their own power and strength,"" said Khan, who brought her 14-year-old daughter, who removed her generation's omnipresent earbuds to take it all in. The women photograph a statue of Eleanor Roosevelt during a stop at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial. They say that they are amazed at how effectively the United States is able to market its short history and that their own countries should do a better job of honoring female leaders. Vital Voices was started in 1997 by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to identify and empower emerging female leaders. It has trained more than 12,000 women from more than 144 countries. Presenters at this year's 11th Annual Global Leadership Awards include such luminaries as Tina Brown, Mariane Pearl, Chelsea Clinton, Diane von Furstenberg, Claire Shipman and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.). The ceremony coincides with the release of ""Vital Voices: The Power of Women Leading Change Around the World,"" a book by Alyse Nelson, the group's president and chief executive. She tells the stories of the international female leaders she has spent time with during her two nearly decades with the organization, including Kenyan Rebecca Lolosoli, who runs Umoja, a women-only village for those fleeing abuse; Somaly Mam, a former sex worker in Cambodia who now helps women in the same situation; and Marina Pisklakova, who started Russia's first domestic violence hotline. The book reads like a global management guide, but one that draws its anecdotes from women who have been agents of social change in male-dominated societies. During a stop at the Georgetown waterfront, Zavaleta - a Mexican politician and former speaker of the house of representatives who exposed widespread corruption within her party - encouraged Shaack to run for office. ""I really want to try,"" Shaack said, asking a slew of questions. The new friends also brainstormed about how to honor the one woman who couldn't make it to the ceremony to receive the organization's Global Trailblazer Award.

The officials said they have relayed their objections to the Egyptians directly and through American mediators. An Egyptian border official confirmed that his Israeli counterparts had voiced concerns. Egypt has been building up its military presence in the lawless area since Islamic militants attacked an army post there on Aug. 5 and killed 16 soldiers. Under the historic peace accord, Egypt was allowed to have only lightly armed policemen in the zone along the border with Israel. Limited numbers of tanks were permitted only in a zone on the far western side of the peninsula. Israel, which also views the Islamic militants as a threat, agreed last year to exceptions to the treaty allowing Egypt's military to deploy heavier weaponry in eastern Sinai close to the border. Egyptian troops moved in after the Aug. 5 attack, backed by armored personnel carriers and attack helicopters, in coordination with the Israelis. However, the Israeli officials alleged that the deployment of heavier M-60 battle tanks went further than agreed and that they should have been consulted. - Associated Press iran Curbs on study by women draw rebuke A recent decision by Iran to ban women from studying dozens of subjects, including nuclear physics and oil engineering, threatens to wipe out one of the last vestiges of gender equality in the country, an exiled Nobel Peace laureate said. The Islamic republic's Science, Research and Technology Ministry has barred women at 36 universities from 77 fields of study, according to state-run media. Female students learned of the curbs when they received their registration letters in recent weeks. The new rules ""demonstrate that the Iranian authorities cannot tolerate women's presence in the public arena,"" Nobel peace laureate Shirin Ebadi wrote in an open letter to the United Nations dated Friday. ""They are trying to push women back to the private sphere of their homes so they may abandon their opposition and legitimate demands."" In 2009, about 52 percent of Iranian university graduates, including 68 percent of science graduates, were women, according to UNESCO. - Bloomberg News liberia Leader suspends sonin corruption probe Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf has suspended her son and 45 other government officials for failing to declare their assets to anti-corruption authorities, in her first significant step toward curbing graft in her administration. Charles Sirleaf, one of three of the president's sons appointed to government posts, was deputy central bank governor. A statement issued late Monday said the officials could be reinstated after they declared their assets. - Reuters Romanian court reinstates suspended president: Romania's Constitutional Court struck down a referendum to impeach President Traian Basescu, foiling a drive by the country's leftist government to oust its chief political opponent just months before a parliamentary election. The government said it would accept the decision but the acting president said Basescu was now an ""illegitimate"" leader. U.S. eases Iran sanctions to allow quake aid: The Obama administration said it is temporarily easing sanctions on Iran to allow Americans to donate money to U.S.-based charities providing direct assistance to victims of two deadly earthquakes that hit the country this month. Aid groups may transfer up to $300,000 over the next 45 days, as long as the money is routed through a foreign bank and does not go to or benefit any individual or entity subject to existing U.S. sanctions, the Treasury Department said. British government Web sites hit over Assange case: Hackers targeted British government Web sites over a period of 24 hours, the government said Tuesday, after the activist hacking group Anonymous said it had launched attacks to protest the handling of the case of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. The Ministry of Justice said it had been affected. S. African mine drops ultimatum to workers: The Lonmin mining company postponed a Tuesday ultimatum for workers to return to work, and a presidential spokesman confirmed that no strikers will be fired in the week South Africa officially mourns the killings of 44 men at the Lonmin platinum mine, including 34 strikers shot dead by police Thursday. Philippine minister's body found: The body of Philippine Interior Secretary Jesse Robredo was retrieved early Tuesday from the sea off a central province where his small plane had crashed three days earlier, officials said. Robredo was popular for his reformist views and policies and his clean image in a political culture traditionally associated with patronage and corruption. Dismembered corpse identified in Toronto: Police identified the victim whose body parts have been found scattered around Toronto as Guang Hua Liu, 41, a single mother of three who owned a now-defunct spa. - From news services Mine deals enrich Israeli billionaire, if not Congo  Dan Gertler's bearded face lights up as he looks out the helicopter window. Below, an installation rises from a clearing in the central African forest, where it transforms ore mined from the ochre earth into sheets of copper. ""Look at it, look at it,"" the Israeli billionaire, 38, shouts through the headset. ""This is what life is all about,"" Gertler says as the chopper lands in the scorching  afternoon heat of the Democratic Republic of Congo. ""Everyone comes with dreams and illusions and promises. Everyone wants quick deals. They don't want to invest. We are real."" Gertler hops out into the dust of Mutanda, a mine controlled by his partner, Glencore International, that holds cobalt and some of the highest-grade copper in the world. He climbs into a Toyota Land Cruiser to tour the mine, tapping messages into one of three BlackBerrys, whose batteries, like those of most smartphones and laptops, often depend on cobalt to keep their charge. Gertler has stakes in companies that control 9.6 percent of world cobalt production. That's just the beginning of his influence in Congo, the largest country of sub-Saharan Africa, with the world's richest deposits of cobalt and major reserves of copper, diamonds, gold, tin and coltan, an ore containing the metal tantalum that is used in consumer electronics. His Gibraltar-registered Fleurette Properties owns stakes in various Congolese mines through at least 60 holding companies in offshore tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands. Gertler, whose grandfather co-founded Israel's diamond exchange in 1947, arrived in Congo in 1997 seeking rough diamonds. The 23-year-old trader struck a friendship with Joseph Kabila, who then headed the Congolese army and today is the nation's president. Since those early days, Gertler has invested in iron ore, gold, cobalt and copper as well as agriculture, oil and banking. In the process, he's built a net worth of at least $2.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Roster of critics He's also acquired a roster of critics. Many of the government's deals with Gertler deprive Congo's 68 million people of badly needed funds, according to the London-based anticorruption group Global Witness and lawmakers from Congo and Britain, the country's second-biggest aid donor after the United States. ""Dan Gertler is essentially looting Congo at the expense of its people,"" said Jean Pierre Muteba, the head of a group of nongovernmental organizations that monitor the mining sector in Katanga province, with most of Congo's copper. ""He has political connections, so state companies sell him mines for low prices and he sells them on for huge profits. That's how he's become a billionaire."" In the eight months preceding the November 2011 elections, in which Kabila won a second five-year term, companies affiliated with Gertler bought shares in five mining ventures from three state-owned firms, according to minutes of board meetings, company filings and documents published later. The state companies didn't announce the sales. In some cases, prices paid were below valuations of the projects made by analysts at Deutsche Bank, Numis Securities and Oriel Securities. Gertler said he did not buy companies at below-market rates or engage in kickbacks. ""The lies are screaming to the heavens,"" he said in his native Hebrew during three days Bloomberg reporters spent with him in Congo and Israel. He returns home to Bnei Brak, an ultra-Orthodox suburb of Tel Aviv, each week to spend the Sabbath with his wife, Anat, and nine children. Congo has a history of making deals out of the public view. The International Monetary Fund has halted a $532 million loan program with the country. It said the government didn't adhere to its demand to publish the full details of a 2011 mining deal between a state-owned miner and a company that reportedly is affiliated with Gertler. Congo will lose out on three loan disbursements worth about $225 million, according to Oscar Melhado, the IMF's resident representative in Congo. As the country's mineral wealth is developed, the lot of Congo's people isn't improving. Congo remains the world's most destitute nation, according to the U.N. Development Programme. Most of the country lives without electricity or running water, and one in five children dies before his or her fifth birthday. Kabila's reelection was marred by irregularities, according to observers. Kabila's opponent, Etienne Tshisekedi, contested the 49 to32 percent vote, charging it was fraudulent. The Congolese Supreme Court ruled it valid. Global Witness has called on Glencore and FTSE 100 Index-listed Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. (ENRC), two companies involved in the pre-election deals with Gertler, to publish details of the transactions and dispel the anti-corruption group's suspicions that Congolese officials received kickbacks for selling assets to Gertler. ""Offering, paying, authorizing, soliciting or accepting bribes is unacceptable to Glencore,"" spokesman Charles Watenphul said. The ENRC declined to comment. Gertler said disclosing the deals to the public is the Congolese government's responsibility. ""We're a private company. Why should we announce?"" he said. ""I should get a Nobel Prize,"" added Gertler, who paced and waved his arms as his demeanor swung between anger and charm. ""They need people like us, who come and put billions in the ground. Without this, the resources are worth nothing."" 'Braved the hurricane' The government insists it's following the rules of the IMF agreement, which calls for it to disclose deals for its natural resources. And Kabila, 41, defends Gertler as a man who staked his fortune on Congo at a time when the country was wracked by war and desperate for cash. ""The truth is, during our very difficult times, there were investors who came and left and others who braved the hurricane,"" he said of Gertler at his riverside palace in December 2011. ""He's one of those."" The bond between the two men is so strong that Kabila at times uses Gertler as a special diplomatic envoy, including in 2002, when the Israeli businessman met with then-U.S. national security adviser Condoleezza Rice to ask for help ending Congo's war with its neighbors. Diamonds have been a backdrop to Gertler's life since his childhood in affluent northern Tel Aviv, where he had a secular upbringing. His mother ran a pop-music radio station, and his father was a goalkeeper for Maccabi Tel Aviv, a top-division pro soccer team, before becoming a diamond dealer. As a youth, Gertler got up at 5 a.m. to learn how to polish gems before heading to school. He joined his grandfather, Romanian emigre Moshe Schnitzer, at business meetings to watch him negotiate diamond deals. When Schnitzer died in 2007, Benjamin Netanyahu,  now Israel's prime minister, gave a eulogy. Gertler recalled a business lesson his grandfather imparted: ""He told me: 'Dan, you meet your bankers and you ask for credit only when you don't need it. Just to secure it. Because when you need it, it is too late.'[#x20ac][#x2c6]"" Gertler said he started buying rough diamonds at age 22, so he could work with larger volumes. Gertler flew between war-torn nations such as Liberia and Angola and the major diamond centers in the United States, India and Israel, buying and selling gems, he said. ""From the beginning, he went his own way,"" says his uncle, Shmuel Schnitzer, 63, former president of the World Federation of Diamond Bourses.""The guy has guts."" Gertler broke with his family's secular tradition when he and Anat decided to adopt an ultra-Orthodox lifestyle. They've banned television and computers from their five-story, terraced house. In Congo, he supports the Chabad-Lubavitch center, which provides religious and educational services to Jews throughout Africa. Gertler's love affair with Congo began in 1997, when the country was one of the world's top five producers of diamonds. That May, insurgents led by Laurent Kabila, the father of the current president, overthrew the corrupt regime of Mobutu Sese Seko, a U.S. ally who had ruled for 32 years. After taking Kinshasa on May 17, Laurent Kabila declared himself president and renamed the country Democratic Republic of Congo. A few days later, Shlomo Bentolila, chief rabbi of Kinshasa's Chabad-Lubavitch center, arranged for the young diamond merchant to meet Kabila's son Joseph, the new army chief, at the InterContinental hotel, Gertler said. The two clicked, he recalled. Both carried a heavy responsibility: Kabila was the commander of thousands of troops, and Gertler was trading $2 billion of diamonds annually, he said. One day, Kabila suggested that Gertler meet the president. Laurent needed money to fight his war and offered Gertler a monopoly on Congo's diamond sales, he said. Kabila asked for $20 million in cash. Gertler agreed. He was back in Israel celebrating the deal when the Congolese president called. He needed the money immediately. Using a mix of bank credit, inheritance, cash reserves and liquidated stocks, Gertler said he scraped together the payment and sent it to the Swiss account of Congo's central bank. Gertler had bet his fortune on a president at war. The risks became evident in January 2001, when a bodyguard shot Laurent Kabila dead and his son took power. Role as envoy The young president needed friends: When he took over, vast swaths of the country were under the control of rebel factions backed by Uganda and Rwanda. Kabila asked Gertler to help woo U.S. support to bolster his position as leader and start peace talks with his neighbors. In April 2002, Gertler said, he secretly shuttled between Washington, Kinshasa and Kigali, Rwanda, relaying letters between Kabila and Rice. Jendayi Frazer, a former special assistant to President George W. Bush, said Gertler's intervention was instrumental to talks that resulted in a peace accord. ""He was serious and credible,"" Frazer said. By the time the peace deal was signed between the government and rebel factions in 2002, millions had died in Congo. Gertler won back a near monopoly of Congo's diamond trade. One of his companies, Emaxon Finance International, paid $15 million in cash and loans to the country's state-owned diamond miner, known as MIBA, for a four- year contract to sell 88 percent of its production. Congo was desperate for investment, Frazer said. ""It's not like he crowded out a lot of other investors,"" she said. ""There weren't many."" Kabila, who had formed a government in which former rebel chiefs were cabinet ministers as part of the peace deal, tried to kick-start Congo's economy. The ministers signed deals to exploit the country's natural resources with foreign companies, many of them at prices that undervalued the assets, the World Bank said. In 2006, Kabila's People's Party for Reconstruction and Development, with a platform of rebuilding the country's infrastructure, was elected in Congo's first free elections in four decades. The backroom deals continued, said Peter Rosenblum, a professor of law at Columbia University who headed the Carter Center's mission to observe the mining review. ""What happened in 2008 and 2009 really proved that the Gertlers of the world would win by doing business the way they'd been doing it all along,"" Rosenblum said. Today, Transparency International ranks only a dozen countries below Congo in its Corruption Perceptions Index. As Kabila cemented his hold on power, Gertler expanded beyond diamonds into mining of other minerals and metals. Charm and aggression Six mining executives who have done business with Gertler say he mixes charm and aggressiveness to make deals. During negotiations, which are often in French - a language Gertler only partially understands - he will hunch over his BlackBerry, seemingly oblivious to the debate, said Pieter Deboutte, the Belgian who runs Gertler's business in Congo. Then, suddenly, he'll catch everyone off guard by interjecting, ""Stop, wait a bit!"" and launch into a list of orders in English to his staff. Gertler's dealings can be wildly profitable. In one case, he earned a 500 percent return in six months without risking a penny as the middleman in a deal for SMKK, which owns a copper and cobalt deposit in Katanga's richest mining zone. Gertler said it's not his fault if the government didn't get a good price for its SMKK holding. ""That is what we know how to do better than anyone else: We know how to maximize value for our projects,"" he said. ""If the government would like to hire my services to maximize value for their stake, they should approach me. No problem."" Copper is what attracts most miners to Congo, with one of the world's biggest reserves, Gertler said. The metal traded at $7,991 a ton in London on Dec. 5, more than double its price on Jan. 5, 2009. In June 2010 and March 2011, state-owned miner Sodimico sold more than 30 mining licenses, including those for two copper projects, to Gertler-linked companies for $60 million. The two projects were estimated to be worth $1.6 billion, though their valuations included ore-processing plants and the licenses. Laurent chief executive Lambert Tshisola Kangoa, said the mines ministry demanded Sodimico give $10 million to the country's general election fund. ""It was not an economic decision by Sodimico,"" he said of the sale. Gertler's joint venture relinquished the rights to the biggest of the mines, Frontier, according to the mines ministry. In July 2012, Congo sold the ENRC the license for Frontier, which in 2009 had been the country's biggest taxpayer, for $101.5 million. ""When you see similar things with slightly different variations happening again and again, you have to stop and think, 'Obviously something is going wrong,'[#x20ac][#x2c6]"" said Daniel Balint-Kurti, chief researcher at Congo for Global Witness. At the Mutanda project, too, Gertler paid far less for his 20 percent than his partner, Glencore International, paid for similar assets. Glencore's outside consulting firm valued the entire mine at about $3 billion. Based on net present value calculations using figures "7-Mar-12,INDIA (98%); PAKISTAN (93%); KENYA (93%); BHUTAN (79%),"The cost of claiming a legitimate income tax refund in Hyderabad, India? 10,000 rupees. The going rate to get a child who has already passed the entrance requirements into high school in Nairobi, Kenya? 20,000 shillings. The expense of obtaining a driver's license after having passed the test in Karachi, Pakistan? 3,000 rupees. Such is the price of what Swati Ramanathan calls ''retail corruption,'' the sort of nickel-and-dime bribery, as opposed to large-scale graft, that infects everyday life in so many parts of the world. Ms. Ramanathan and her husband, Ramesh, along with Sridar Iyengar, set out to change all that in August 2010 when they started ipaidabribe.com, a site that collects anonymous reports of bribes paid, bribes requested but not paid and requests that were expected but not forthcoming. About 80 percent of the more than 400,000 reports to the site tell stories like the ones above of officials and bureaucrats seeking illicit payments to provide routine services or process paperwork and forms. ''I was asked to pay a bribe to get a birth certificate for my daughter,'' someone in Bangalore, India, wrote in to the Web site on Feb. 29, recording payment of a 120-rupee bribe in Bangalore. ''The guy in charge called it 'fees' '' -- except there are no fees charged for birth certificates, Ms. Ramanathan said. Now, similar sites are spreading like kudzu around the globe, vexing petty bureaucrats the world over. Ms. Ramanathan said nongovernmental organizations and government agencies from at least 17 countries had contacted Janaagraha, the nonprofit organization in Bangalore that operates I Paid a Bribe, to ask about obtaining the source code and setting up a site of their own. Last year, the Kingdom of Bhutan's Anti-Corruption Commission created an online form to allow the anonymous reporting of corruption, and a similar site was created in Pakistan, ipaidbribe, which estimates that the country's economy has lost some 8.5 trillion rupees, or about $94 billion, over the last four years to corruption, tax evasion and weak governance. ''We're working to create a coalition of I Paid a Bribe groups that would perhaps meet annually and share experiences,'' Ms. Ramanathan said. Ben Elers, program director for Transparency International, a nongovernmental organization, said social media had given the average person powerful new tools to fight endemic corruption. ''In the past, we tended to view corruption as this huge, monolithic problem that ordinary people couldn't do anything about,'' Mr. Elers said. ''Now, people have new tools to identify it and demand change.'' Since no names are given on the sites, in part to avoid potential issues of libel and defamation, it is impossible to verify the reports, but Mr. Elers and others experienced in exposing corruption say many of them ring true. They are threatening enough that when a rash of similar sites popped up in China last summer, the government stamped them out within a couple of weeks, contending they had failed to register with the authorities. They are, however, only a reporting mechanism. ''In their own right, they don't change anything,'' Mr. Elers said. ''The critical thing is that mechanisms are developed to turn this online activity into offline change in the real world.'' Antony Ragui is hoping that happens in Kenya, where he started an ipaidabribe site in December. The site has gotten about thousands of hits since then and recorded about 470 bribery reports. The bribes are as varied as payments to make traffic infractions vanish from records and payments for admission to schools and for passports and identification documents. ''What if that person who paid a bribe to get a driver's license because he failed his driving test hits your sister or your child?'' Mr. Ragui said. ''We have a huge issue of Somalis paying bribes to get passports and personal identity cards to come to Kenya -- what if one of them is a terrorist who blows something up? The bribes may be small but the consequences may be big for you and me.'' His big concern at the moment is how to pay for the site. Unlike the Indian site, which has received money from the Omidyar Network and is housed within a well-financed nonprofit, the Kenyan I Paid a Bribe thus far is supported by Mr. Ragui himself. Stephen King, the partner who oversees the technology for government transparency and accountability at the Omidyar Network, the organization that manages the philanthropy of the eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, said sustainability was an issue for many such groups. The Omidyar Network supported Janaagraha to develop I Paid a Bribe, but the Web site will have to find a way to sustain itself. ''A couple of the organizations we're working with in the area of transparency and accountability have been looking at things like microdonations, asking for a nominal amount to help cover their costs like a Wikipedia model,'' Mr. King said. ''There's also some potential for carrying advertising on the sites.'' Another idea, he said, was for such organizations to customize their platforms for other groups for a fee. Mr. Ragui in Kenya is working to develop a system to enable reporting of bribery by mobile phone that he hopes to have ready in time for elections later this year. The idea is to allow people to report vote-buying in real time that will be connected to a map. ''It could be really powerful to have real time, granular data to analyze how much corruption affect the election,'' he said. ''My real goal, though,'' he added, ''is to change just one government department and how it does business.'' That is what happened in Bangalore, where Bhaskar Rao, the transport commissioner for the state of Karnataka, used the data collected on I Paid a Bribe to push through reforms in the motor vehicle department. Some 20 senior officers in the department were ''cautioned,'' Mr. Rao said, and many others received ethics counseling. Licenses are now applied for online -- and last year, Bangalore became home to the world's first automated driving test tracks. Drivers navigate a figure eight, demonstrate their ability to parallel park, put their car in reverse and perform other tasks over a test of about nine minutes that is monitored by electronic sensors. ''It totally eliminated the whims and fancies of the motor vehicle inspectors,'' Mr. Rao, now inspector general of police for internal security, said in a telephone interview. ''It is videotaped so everyone can see the results and everything is very transparent.'' He said he could not have made the changes without I Paid a Bribe. ''It was my unofficial spokesman to drive home the message that the public was really upset about this corruption,'' Mr. Rao said. ''It helped me get my colleagues to fall in line, and it helped me persuade my superiors that we needed to do this.'' Such concrete evidence of impact is nice, but Mr. King said the sites also were likely to have a deterrent effect that was difficult to measure. ''As the information because more public over time and awareness of such reporting grows,'' he said, ''I suspect those who might have been tempted to engage in this type of corruption are less likely to because the risk of being caught is much greater.''"15-Dec-12,NIGERIA (95%);,"Riots across Tunisia, December 2010. Demonstrations in Moscow, December 2011. Fasts and street marches in New Delhi, March 2012 - plus street movements in Slovenia; Quebec; Iraq; Azerbaijan; and Wukan, southern China, among others, throughout the past two years. What do they all have in common? The answer is corruption, or, rather, the desire to end corruption, which is now the primary motivating factor in dozens of political movements around the world. Of course, many of the recent riots, strikes, street demonstrations and political turmoil have other sources, too. But even in Tunisia, where protesters questioned the very legitimacy of the regime, political anger was fueled by stories of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, his wife and their relatives - as well as their hotels, factories and real estate, sometimes expropriated from other people and usually exploited by connections and outright extortion. The riots that followed were anti-regime, anti-corruption and anti-repression, all at once. In Russia, last winter's protesters likewise made no distinction between their repressive political system and the corruption of their political class: On the contrary, as their leaders have argued, the one exists in order to feed the other. Alexei Navalny, the most prominent member of this new generation of Russian ""dissidents,"" explains bluntly on one of his Web sites dedicated to local and municipal corruption that his work is necessary ""because pensioners, doctors and teachers are practically starving while the thieves in power buy ever more villas, yachts, and the devil knows what else."" Although Russians still allude to the ideals of the past - last December, one Moscow demonstrator carried a ""We need a Havel"" placard - Navalny doesn't talk much about human rights or democracy. Instead, he talks about money: who has it, who stole it, who misspent it, who smuggled it out of the country. In this sense, he has much in common with the Chinese communists who officially expelled the provincial leader Bo Xilai a few months ago - Bo's wife stands accused of murder, and Bo himself of taking large bribes - as well as Liu Zhijun, a former minister accused of taking more than $100 million in kickbacks during the construction of China's overpriced high-speed railways. ""Reform"" in Russia and China isn't about human rights - or not only about human rights. It's about getting people to stop stealing. As China's new anti-corruption chief told his colleagues, the party's survival depends on it. But corruption is hardly a new issue in China, Russia, India, Slovenia, Azerbaijan or anywhere else. Why has it come to the forefront of so many political struggles right now? As the Economist argues this week, the internationalization of the anti-corruption movement might explain some of the change. Pressure on corrupt politicians and businessmen now comes not only from within their societies but also from authorities enforcing America's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or Britain's Bribery Act; from voluntary but rapidly growing industry groups, including the International Corporate Governance Network and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative; from activists such as Global Witness and Open Oil; and from campaigners in the mold of Bill Browder, the businessman who persuaded the U.S. Senate to pass the Magnitsky Act, a law that denies U.S. visas to Russian officials responsible for the torture and murder of a Russian lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who uncovered a massive tax fraud. Transparency International, once a small, quixotic organization, publishes an annual corruption index, which is now scoured anxiously by leaders around the globe. Of course, Amnesty International was once a small, quixotic organization, too. But as the international human rights movement has grown in stature, authoritarian leaders have learned how to fight it. The human rights movement has been variously derided as ""Western,"" and thus alien to Chinese or perhaps ""Asian"" values, or else as ""hypocritical,"" originating in societies with problems of their own. The Iranian regime has welcomed ""persecuted"" historians who deny the Holocaust to conferences in Tehran, just to make that point. Still in its infancy, the international anti-corruption movement has the potential to enhance and augment human rights rhetoric enormously. Both movements rely on arguments about justice and the rule of law, and both appeal to the human instinct for fairness. Though it probably won't be long before someone finds a way to cast ""anti-corruption"" as another form of Western imperialism, for the moment the movement's other strength is its universalism: Its arguments and tactics work in democracies as well as dictatorships. Indeed, they are more effective in societies where the public can at least vote the thieves out of office. One wonders whether their neighbors who can't do so might soon feel jealous. applebaumletters@washpost.com Nigeria Leader Amazes Many With Strong Anti-Graft Drive  After Friday prayers, townsfolk say, Maryam Abacha, the widow of the dictator who ruled and looted this country for five years, has begun opening the gates of the family compound to the city's poor, who fill her courtyard to receive free bags of rice, millet and sorghum. The practice is regarded here as a crude attempt to burnish the image of the Abachas, who have become the poster family of an unexpected and ambitious drive by the county's new president, Olusegun Obasanjo, to root out corruption. Since taking over in May as the first civilian president in nearly 16 years, Mr. Obasanjo has extended his investigation into nearly all levels of society that benefited from the military rule that made Nigeria one of the world's most corrupt countries. The government has seized properties belonging to retired military officials, senior civil servants are being investigated for fraud and high-ranking officers, forced to retire by President Obasanjo, are now on trial. The Abacha family home is surrounded by heavily armed soldiers, and his widow remains a virtual prisoner inside. A Swiss court, at Nigeria's request, has frozen the family's accounts, which may total more than $2 billion. Some critics say the government has yet to undertake the serious reforms needed to wipe out corruption in a country whose vast oil reserves draw in billions of loosely controlled dollars a year. Other skeptics say some of the Obasanjo government's own practices, particularly its dealings with Parliament, are themselves shady and undermine its cleanup effort. Nevertheless, most acknowledge that Mr. Obasanjo -- a former general whose election campaign was bankrolled by military leaders and who many doubted would look into the past -- has far surpassed expectations. In the 1970's, when Mr. Obasanjo first served as president, his government was known to have skimmed money from the country's oil exports, which were much in demand during the oil crises of the period. Also, officials were known to expect payments for import licenses and government contracts. Officials say the current examination is expected to cover government activities going back to 1966, when the military first took over the country. ""Not too many people expected a quarter of what Obasanjo has done in terms of his anti-corruption stance,"" said Tunde Oni, projects manager for Integrity, a group based in Lagos, the former capital, that tracks corruption and is financed by American sources. ""Those affected most are the big military and political elite who have controlled our country for many years. They have much to lose."" Femi Ajayi, a Lagos-based banker who like many of his colleagues was arbitrarily imprisoned for four years by Gen. Sani Abacha, the military ruler, when the army systematically purchased stakes in the country's biggest banks, said military officials now controlled most Nigerian banks. President Obasanjo will succeed in fighting corruption, Mr. Ajayi said. ""But,"" he added, ""he will have a very difficult time, because the people he is going after have enormous resources that they will use against him."" While such steps are not risk-free in a country that has known military coups, the Obasanjo government's efforts are aimed at recovering what could amount to billions of dollars needed to rebuild Nigerian society after years of misrule. The aggressive cleanup at home could buttress Mr. Obasanjo's requests for Western governments, including Washington, to trace Nigeria's stolen money overseas and for Nigeria to be rewarded with what he has called a ""democracy dividend."" That would include forgiveness of at least some of the $30 billion owed by a government whose reserves were depleted during military rule. President Obasanjo had succeeded so far without facing a serious revolt from his powerful enemies, analysts said, partly because his anti-corruption campaign has been the one issue that has received strong support throughout this ethnically and religiously divided country. What's more, he began his crackdown on corruption immediately after taking office, using his unique position in Nigeria to do so. As the man who served as the country's military ruler in the 1970's and was later imprisoned for three years by General Abacha in the 1990's, Mr. Obasanjo is both an insider and outsider, said Pat Utomi, an economist at the Lagos Business School. ""He was the man juxtaposed by the events of history to play this role right now,"" Mr. Utomi said. ""And so he's governing fearlessly, almost as if he has a death wish. Why? He's 61 years old. He's been president, he's been jailed. He has money. He has achieved everything. This is what's left."" President Obasanjo has also strengthened his hold over the military by forcing about 150 senior officers who had held political appointments since 1985 to retire abruptly. Most of those being tried or investigated are from that group. No one is talking openly of a potential military backlash against Mr. Obasanjo, partly because his efforts have proven popular and the military remains extremely unpopular after nearly 16 years of disastrous rule. But in a country where generals have led for all but 10 years since independence from Britain in 1960, and where nine successful or failed coups have taken place, the possibility of revolt remains real. In Lagos and in Abuja, the capital, the Obasanjo government confiscated plots of land that the military government bought in 1997 and gave to 37 high-ranking military officials. In the same area in Lagos, construction has stopped on a Total gas station that was being built by a company believed to belong to Vice Adm. Mike Akhigbe, who was second to Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar in the transition government preceding President Obasanjo's inauguration. After local people complained that the station sat dangerously alongside a highway, the Lagos state government agreed that the project violated zoning laws and condemned it. Today, the red X's painted on the station's walls have come to symbolize how ordinary Nigerians and the rule of law succeeded in stopping the will of someone who was the second most powerful man in the country less than six months ago. ""If you are looking at the kind of people who are being investigated, these are sacred cows,"" Mr. Utomi said. ""This is going after big fish."" Critics say the targets in this campaign are being unfairly persecuted. ""Our case is just a vendetta against us,"" said Maj. Abdulhadi Al-Mustapha, the younger brother of General Abacha's former security chief who lost his farm land and is on trial on murder charges. ""I wonder why they are targeting only particular people. Government is a collective regime. So whenever something goes wrong in a regime, blame should go to the entire regime."" Various investigations have also found corruption at all levels of military and government power in appointments, in allocation of licenses, in contracts and in purchases, said Christopher Kolade, the chairman of one of several government panels looking into past military rule and a former chief executive of Cadbury's operations in Nigeria. ""The scale of corruption we have found is sometimes astonishing,"" said Mr. Kolade, interviewed in Abuja. ""On the whole, though, we knew what we might encounter."" One of Mr. Kolade's biggest discoveries was the secret award of lucrative offshore oil exploration contracts to companies linked to military officials. The Obasanjo government canceled the contracts, and the president said guidelines for a fresh selection would be announced soon. Beyond those headline-grabbing findings, Mr. Kolade said that what was harder to quantify was a culture of corruption that permeated all levels of Nigerian society, from a police officer who squeezes 10 cents out a taxi driver to a bureaucrat who grants a permit in return for a hundred-dollar bribe. The crackdown at the top appears to have trickled down to the street, as soldiers have returned to the barracks and police officers have grown more hesitant in openly demanding bribes. In the northern city of Kaduna, a judicial commission is examining the workings of a fertilizer plant that many say represents a typical case of local corruption. A former director of the plant, Dalandi Kifasi, is accused of giving free fertilizer bags to officials in the federal Agriculture Ministry and other powerful figures in the Abacha government, including $6,000 worth to a foundation created by Major Al-Mustapha, General Abacha's former security chief. And Mr. Kifasi is being investigated for ordering four all-wheel-drive trucks for his plant and giving them to agriculture officials. In an interview in his house in Kaduna, Mr. Kifasi defended his actions, saying the vehicles had been seized by the officials without his knowledge. As for the fertilizer bags, Mr. Kifasi argued that it was common practice to thank those who had helped a business with a gift. ""All the companies I've worked for in Nigeria -- it's normal, it's very, very normal,"" Mr. Kifasi said. He was blameless, he said, adding that the Obasanjo government's anti-corruption zeal had pushed people to lie to incriminate him. In Parliament a sweeping anti-corruption bill proposed by the Obasanjo administration has languished for months. The legislature has been paralyzed since June as members have rebelled against leaders backed by the president. The speaker of the lower house was forced to resign after reports that he had lied about his educational background and other credentials. Similar allegations emerged about Evan Enwerem, whom the president's aides successfully promoted for Senate president in June. Lawmakers and diplomats based in Nigeria say the aides handed out bags of money to senators to secure their votes. Shielded by the president, Mr. Enwerem was able to retain his position until last Thursday, when he was impeached by the Senate. ""Obasanjo has not convinced us that he is determined to clean out corruption no matter who is involved,"" said Farouk Lawan, the chairman of the lower house's ethics committee. ""The example of the Senate president means that in the crusade against corruption there are sacred cows. That means that to be shielded against corruption, all you have to be is Obasanjo's man."" Mr. Kolade, the chairman of the government investigative panel, acknowledged that those political tactics had weakened the president's anti-corruption campaign. ""It does,"" Mr. Kolade said. ""It does to a certain extent. You want to move forward but have to go through this political machinery that puts shackles on your legs."" Here in Kano, the Abachas' hometown, the mood was in favor of moving forward. Near the Abacha compound's gates, supporters of Mohammed Abacha, a son of General Abacha who is being detained in Lagos on charges of murdering the wife of a former opposition leader, scrawled graffiti on walls: ""Free Mohammed Abacha."" Just above that, someone added, ""Don't.""  http://www.nytimes.com Map of Nigeria highlighting Kano: The family of Nigeria's former military dictator lives in Kano. (pg.

It was 2010, and I was chairwoman of a Liberian government committee responsible for reforming the awarding of international scholarships. We discovered that a group of 18-year-old boys had forged their national exam records to become eligible for a scholarship to Morocco. I wasn't surprised; fraud has become a national pastime in Liberia. If you're ethical and upright, you're called stupid. If you're ruthless, greedy and cunning, you get praised as a national hero. In her 2006 inaugural address, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf vowed to make corruption public enemy number one, despite the country's long history of patronage and graft. Seven years on, corruption remains in full public view and has yet to be stamped out. This month, the country's auditor general was dismissed for using his private company to get a government contract. And earlier this year, a member of the House of Representatives was caught on tape allegedly soliciting a bribe, yet he remains in office. In the last 10 years, Liberia has received billions of dollars in international aid, but questions are starting to be asked about how those donor dollars are spent. Last month, $13 million from the European Union for health-related projects reportedly went missing before resurfacing. While maternal mortality remains high, government officials are squabbling over who should get the lion's share of the country's meager $553 million budget. The only way corruption will be rooted out here and elsewhere in Africa is if we teach our children to recognize it, reject it and condemn and shame their elders. When we invited the 18-year-olds who had forged their records to a meeting to coax them into confessing, they initially sat stone-faced, in their pristine white shirts and pleated pants. Then one of them cracked. ''Yes, it was me. I did it,'' he said. But more disturbing than the act of cheating was the fact that these young men believed they had done nothing wrong -- that falsifying documents was a legitimate exercise as long as you didn't get caught. They were simply parroting the kind of corruption they've seen in school, government and the private sector. Here, corruption is enmeshed in daily human interaction; it is a function of both poverty and greed. Journalists take bribes because media salaries are virtually nonexistent; businesses sell substandard goods with impunity; squatters auction off land that doesn't belong to them; and university students pay professors to manipulate their grades. The government sits on top of all this mischief, unable -- and in some ways unwilling -- to change a system that often benefits the rich and powerful. One could argue that Liberia's very foundation is built on theft and dispossession. The country was ''founded'' in 1847 by repatriated slaves from the United States who in turn disenfranchised indigenous populations for over a century. But I refuse to believe that our inability -- or reluctance -- to overcome corruption is only a function of history. Governance gurus and donors often argue that building institutions in fragile states like Liberia will weed out corruption. But institutions are not one-size-fits-all, foolproof structures for curbing human vice. If individuals are corrupt, then the institutions they represent, no matter how strong, can also be corrupted. The real challenge lies in straightening a severely crooked ethical order. And we can't afford to wait until someone is 18 to demand that he or she miraculously develops scruples. The adults, mired in a culture of endemic corruption, are unyielding. It's the children who must lead Liberia's moral revolution. Our children have been born into a country recovering from war, where people are openly questioning the status quo more than ever before. They also have the uncanny ability to imagine alternative ways of doing things. And they are at the critical stage in their development when it is easy to challenge old values and instill new ones. But first, we have to arm them with the right tools. Children gravitate to audio and visual stimuli, so anyone rallying them against corruption must employ radio dramas, popular songs, games and storybooks. I wrote ''Gbagba,'' an anti-corruption primer for kids, to teach them about values and ethics. But instead of employing spiders or rabbits, Gbagba has human characters, with contemporary scenarios that children can relate to. The project was conceived out of my own frustrations in returning to Liberia, where, after many years living abroad, I found an inverted social order, where wrong appears right, and right offers few benefits. During Liberia's civil war, those who survived did so by both fair and foul means. During peace, we are struggling to discern the thin line between fair and foul, and floundering in the process. But the books won't work for everyone. Like most places around the world with low literacy rates, radio is an important means of communicating and mobilizing here. Radio dramas, songs and games for children must be the starting point for a national dialogue on ethics that no outsider could manufacture. Liberia's children -- and kids throughout Africa -- are an untapped arsenal in the war against corruption that we have ignored for much too long. But only if we teach them that corruption is not inevitable will children begin to shame adults into doing the right thing.

""The first country to be chosen by the American people should be Nigeria,"" said Samuel Ayankoso, 57, a taxi driver in Lagos, Nigeria's largest city. ""We are the giant of Africa."" That Obama also is not visiting about 50 other African nations seems beside the point. Here in Africa's self-enthroned behemoth, Obama's sojourn to small but stable Ghana has spawned an outpouring of soul-searching and self-flagellation about Nigeria's image and dubious democracy. ""Why would Obama want to come to Nigeria? To lend credence to the putrefying edifice that the nation has largely become?"" one writer asked in the Guardian newspaper. Wole Soyinka, a Nobel prize-winning writer, said he would ""stone"" Obama if he legitimized Nigeria by visiting. It is unsurprising that Obama's first visit as president to sub-Saharan Africa, an Obama-obsessed region that views him as a native son, would inspire continental envy. But in a country where democratic expression has been stunted by flawed elections, the move has given critics a fresh opportunity to stick it to their government. They call it a clear indictment of Nigeria's ever-present corruption, President Umaru Yar'Adua's slow progress, the conflict in the oil-rich Niger Delta and what some here see as cooled relations with the United States. ""Most people believe it's deliberate, not a mere oversight, and it's a statement and the message is well conveyed,"" said Reuben Abati, editor of the Guardian. ""Nigerians are very angry with their government."" Nigerian officials, for their part, shrug off the angst. ""It was a nonissue,"" Jibrin D. Chinade, Yar'Adua's special adviser on foreign affairs, said in an interview. ""There is no message."" Obama arrived  for an overnight stop in Ghana on Friday. White House officials said he will emphasize good governance and U.S. commitment to Africa, to which President George W. Bush massively increased aid. An Obama administration official declined to say whether the president considered visiting Nigeria but said Ghana was chosen because it is ""a model for other countries"" in a region beset by ""troubled elections and coups."" But in those words is an essential truth: When it comes to democracy in Africa, Ghana is a rising star. Nigeria, on the other hand, seems trapped in a black hole. Ghana became in 1957  the first African country to gain independence; it  is a poor but steady nation in a rough corner of the continent.  It won international praise last year for an ultra-close and peaceful election that marked its second transfer of power since a military ruler re-launched democracy in 1992. Investors praise Ghana's open-market economy, which is likely to be boosted by recently discovered oil. Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation with 150 million people, has long thought of itself as the continent's beating heart. Its economy is Africa's second-largest, and its international peacekeeping force -- the world's fourth-biggest -- patrols across the region. But corruption that watchdogs rank among the world's worst has kept most Nigerians in poverty. Infrastructure is poor, and generators power much of the country. The Niger Delta is simmering with low-level warfare over oil. Still, Nigeria is a key U.S. ally in West Africa, where drug trafficking and piracy are on the rise. Nigeria also is the fifth-largest oil supplier to the United States. Bush, whose anti-terrorism efforts were backed by then-Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, visited the nation in 2003. ""Nigeria is, for a variety of reasons, the most important country in sub-Saharan Africa, bar none,"" Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson told AllAfrica.com, which covers sub-Saharan Africa. But the dialogue has chilled since 2007, foreign policy experts say, when the United States joined a global chorus in criticizing the Nigerian elections that brought Yar'Adua to power. He took office promising reforms of the electoral system, electricity sector, the Niger Delta and other problems, but little progress has been made. Adding insult was Washington's recent feting of two fierce Nigeria critics: one, a former minister in Obasanjo's administration; the other, Nigeria's crusading former anti-corruption czar, who testified before Congress about being forced from his job after accusing 31 former governors of looting. ""Even in the best of times, I don't know of any Nigerian leader who has access to Congress,"" said Akinjide Osuntokun, an international relations professor and government adviser. The announcement about Obama's visit to Ghana was another blow, he said. That was followed by one of the more bizarre moments in recent U.S.-Nigerian relations. In May, a top ruling party official accused the opposition and the U.S. Embassy of plotting a ""diabolical delegation"" to meet with Obama in Ghana in an attempt to undermine the Nigerian government. The ruling party distanced itself from the allegation, and the U.S. Embassy denied it. Schemes aside, Osuntokun said, there is a sense among Nigerians that their nation, which recently launched a ""rebranding"" effort to polish its image, is losing influence. Although Ghana holds  the distinction  of being Africa's first independent country, it has also depended much on Nigeria. In the 1970s, millions of Ghanaians fled their tumbling economy for oil-rich Nigeria. In 1983, as the economy soured in Nigeria and xenophobia rose, it expelled 1 million Ghanaians. Today, Ghana is the draw for thousands of Nigerians seeking more business-friendly climes and a calmer environment for their families. International companies including Michelin have decamped from Nigeria for Ghana. Nigerian officials insist their country is still a major world player, noting that they recently received Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and were invited to attend this week's Group of Eight summit in Italy. And not everyone in this busy, dynamic country has time to agonize over Obama's stop in Ghana, as evidenced by lawyer Cephas Caleb, 24, who was shopping at a bustling Lagos street market the other day. ""There are more important problems for us as a nation,"" Caleb said, ""than having the American president visit for two days or not."" Staff writer Michael A. Fletcher, traveling with Obama,  contributed to this report."17-May-06,NIGERIA (98%); AFRICA (92%); FRANCE (79%); UNITED STATES (79%),"The Nigerian Senate voted on Tuesday to reject a constitutional amendment allowing President Olusegun Obasanjo to seek a third term, bringing an apparent end to an issue that had bitterly divided Africa's most populous nation. Obasanjo's supporters did not immediately rule out other attempts to amend the nation's constitution, but in recent weeks there has been a dramatic and seemingly decisive shift in sentiment against efforts to keep him in power. Assuming Obasanjo is not a candidate in elections next year, Nigeria is on track to experience its first peaceful transition between civilian governments since winning independence in 1960. Debate over a possible third term had been marred by accusations of bribery and violence on the part of supporters. On Tuesday, lawmakers opposed to the proposal cheered and hugged one another as the outcome of the voice vote became clear, according to news reports. Senate President Ken Nnamani, in a nationally televised address, said, ""The Senate has said clearly and eloquently that we should discontinue other proceedings on this amendment."" The action also effectively ended a parallel debate in the House. To pass, a constitutional amendment needs the support of two-thirds of each chamber as well as approval from two-thirds of Nigeria's states. The bid to extend Obasanjo's tenure was among several proposed amendments rejected Tuesday. ""It is dead now,"" said Rep. Wunmi Bewaji, an opposition leader, speaking from Abuja, the capital. ""It is a very, very good day for us. It's a victory for our people. It's a victory for our democracy."" He expressed fears that the rejection of the constitutional amendment could encourage extralegal efforts to keep Obasanjo in power. The president has said repeatedly that he would respect the political system and Nigeria's constitution. Obasanjo, 70, had never publicly acknowledged plans to run again, but the effort to amend Nigeria's constitution was widely viewed as engineered by him and his top aides. He had said in interviews that more years in office would allow him to complete initiatives. Obasanjo was in France but due to return Tuesday night. Femi Fani-Kayode, a special assistant to the president, said from Abuja that Obasanjo would respect the decision of the National Assembly. ""Under the provisions of the constitution as they stand, it's not possible for the president to run,"" Fani-Kayode said. He did not rule out the possibility of another effort to change the constitution. ""That would be for the National Assembly"" to decide, he said. Obasanjo, a military ruler in the 1970s, was elected in 1999, ending what had been decades of turbulent and often repressive rule, mostly by the military. He won reelection in 2003 and is scheduled to step down in May 2007. In recent weeks, the United States, Britain and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan had criticized the effort to let Obasanjo stay in power, saying it threatened to undermine democracy. Leading Nigerian politicians, including both of the most prominent candidates to succeed him, also criticized the push. Nigeria's anti-corruption agency, meanwhile, opened an investigation into allegations of bribery by the supporters of a third term. Opponents have repeatedly alleged that millions of dollars in bribes have been offered to supporters. Obasanjo has denied knowledge of bribes being given. Also on Tuesday, one senator said he had been targeted Sunday in an assassination attempt by Obasanjo supporters. Fani-Kayode said, ""Certainly Mr. President is not a bribe giver, nor is he a murderer."""25-Nov-99,NIGERIA (98%); NIGER (79%); UNITED STATES (79%);,"Up in the spectators' gallery, they're fighting over the red, plush seats. They're sitting on the stairs. They're standing on tiptoe to get a glimpse of the Senate chamber. Suddenly, it's the best show in town. It's democracy. In a country so overwhelmed by troubles that it often appeared destined for collapse, the end of military rule has opened a deep vein of optimism in this nation of cynics, and fueled a fierce loyalty to Nigeria's new president, Olusegun Obasanjo. It has also turned the national legislature, long a toy for a succession of military puppet masters, into a spectator sport. On busy days, the galleries are crowded with students, bureaucrats and aides. Janitors stop by on breaks. Average citizens, who need appointments, argue with guards to get in. They all come to watch the army of well-fed, cell phone-toting legislators in flowing robes battle it out. ""We're making progress,"" said Femi Oldobaju, a law student watching Senate proceedings on a recent afternoon. His words echo across this nation of 110 million. Small businessmen in the dusty northern town of Gusau gush about the end of military rule. Taxi drivers creeping through Lagos's filthy, chaotic streets proclaim devotion to Obasanjo. In the pastel condominiums of Abuja, a city that seems more California office park than African capital, bureaucrats criticize the government without fear of arrest. After 15 years of brutal military rule that left their country an international pariah, Nigerians are learning to be democrats. A mile or so from the green-domed legislature, in a fortified compound built by his military predecessors, lives the man who embodies this era. Obasanjo, a former military ruler who 20 years ago gave up power to Nigeria's last elected government, has moved swiftly since taking office in May. He has backed tough anti-corruption legislation, tried to blur ethnic and religious lines and, perhaps most importantly, convinced ordinary Nigerians they have a role in their government. And while most people here say it's too early to tell if the campaign will be successful, they are giddy with the possibilities. ""The new government has brought hope to my life,"" said Michael Okunsanmi, a struggling real estate broker sitting in his closet-size office in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital. ""I can aspire to be whatever I want. My children can be whatever they want."" The problems Obasanjo faces are immense. Corruption is endemic, horrific ethnic violence is practically routine, and unemployment hovers near 50 percent. Nearly one in five children dies before age 5. The country's infrastructure--phones, electricity, water--is beyond crumbling. Obasanjo's biggest challenge may lie in the Niger Delta, home to the country's enormous oil wealth. There, in a maze of swamps, millions live in desperate poverty. Gangs attack oil installations, kidnap oil workers and feud with other ethnic groups. The problem has worsened in recent days: A dozen police officers were killed in one state alone, leading soldiers to seal off the region. Human rights groups fear numerous civilian casualties and say democracy there is just a dream. In theory, Nigeria, a regional power that dominates West African politics, should live comfortably off its oil profits. Instead, living standards have declined, consumed by corruption and chaos. ""For now, the feeling of Nigerians is, 'Yes, we feel we're involved in our government.' But the question is, how will this translate into improved living standards?"" asked Idris Abubakar, a senator from northern Gombe state. The burden of solving these problems has fallen to Obasanjo, whom critics accuse of waffling on whether to privatize Nigeria's inefficient state industries, pushing anti-corruption legislation that gives too much power to the secret police and treating the legislature as a mere annoyance. Obasanjo's success at bringing more fuel to gasoline pumps, ending shortages that often forced drivers to wait in line for days, has boosted his popularity--but not enough to buoy his entire four-year term, many say. ""The euphoria will clear shortly,"" predicted Olissa Agbakoba, a human rights lawyer. ""He's more of a wheeler-dealer than a true visionary leader."" It's the legislature, though, that has attracted most criticism. Legislators have repeatedly embarrassed themselves, demanding enormous furniture stipends and squabbling so much that they have passed just a few bills. The House speaker and the Senate president were forced from office over resume-padding allegations. Recently, a group of senators defeated a procedural motion so intricate that even Oldobaju, the law student, was baffled. Then the legislators jumped from their seats, cheered, and slapped each other's hands in a sort of Nigerian high-five. ""As you can see, we're just beginning,"" Oldobaju said, smiling wryly. ""We'll get there. We'll get there soon."" Mary Adewale, 2, hangs on to her mother's dress as she does laundry outdoors in the impoverished Oworonski neighborhood of Lagos.

Journalists call it ""the brown envelope."" And politicians call it ""a welfare package."" Whatever the name, the almighty bribe long has lubricated Nigerian society as it has few others on Earth. Corruption is so rampant that when the nation's education minister, Fabian Osuji, was caught giving $400,000 to Nigerian lawmakers for favorable votes, he formally protested that such behavior was ""common knowledge and practice at all levels of government."" Besides, Osuji added, he had struck a good deal; the lawmakers had asked for twice as much. He was fired from the government. Now, after decades of open and freewheeling graft, President Olusegun Obasanjo has declared war on corruption. And Osuji is far from alone in suddenly having to account for his actions. A succession of senior government figures  --  including the top police official, the housing minister and the Senate president  --  also have been pushed from their jobs in recent months and threatened with jail for offenses that once would have earned them little more than a wink. The police official, Tafa Balogun, even appeared in court wearing handcuffs. And in separate action, a court in Abuja, the capital, has ruled that the son of late dictator Sani Abacha must stand trial for his alleged role in the looting of more than $1 billion in public funds during his father's reign from 1993 to 1998. Obasanjo and his allies portray the anti-corruption campaign as nothing less than a battle to redeem the tainted soul of a nation, the largest in Africa with about 137 million people. Even the Catholic Mass here includes a prayer against corruption. ""We are trying to change Nigeria,"" said Mustapha Akanbi, a stern retired judge who heads one of two independent anti-corruption commissions and who, on his desk, has a paper clip dispenser that says: ""Don't Give Bribe, Don't Take Bribe."" Akanbi said he tells his roughly 150 investigators and prosecutors that ""they are engaged in a struggle, in a revolution for their country. We are trying to teach people to give up their greed and corruption and put service to the nation first."" Transparency International, a corruption monitoring group based in Berlin, ranks Nigeria as the third-most-corrupt nation on Earth  --  a fact that has prompted some here to joke that a clever government official must have paid a hefty bribe to keep the group from ranking Nigeria first or second. Only Bangladesh and Haiti were rated more corrupt. Navigating the most basic government services, such as getting freight through customs, often requires a bribe in Nigeria. Motorists have little choice but to pay police officers  --  many armed with automatic rifles  --  who set up impromptu roadblocks to demand a ""kola nut."" The caffeine-laden nut is a traditional offering of hospitality in Nigeria, but to police the term refers to a wad of money worth anywhere from a few cents to several dollars, depending on the type of vehicle and the mood of the officer. Politicians take bribes and give them, including payments to reporters who can make more money from those they cover than from their meager newspaper paychecks, according to journalists familiar with the practice. For the high-stakes deals between politicians, the preferred packages are known as ""Ghana-Must-Go bags."" The satchels, made of colorful woven plastic, were commonly used as suitcases in the 1980s, when the government was pressuring immigrants from nearby Ghana to return home. Filled, a Ghana-Must-Go bag can hold hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of naira, the Nigerian currency. It was such a bag, according to news reports here, that the education minister used in December to send a ""welfare package"" to the home of the Senate president. ""I protested this demand,"" Osuji told an ethics committee, ""but the Senate president sternly told me to go back to my ministry and find the money."" Many here trace the root of corruption to the decades of military governments that ruled Nigeria before Obasanjo's election in 1999. The treasury, flush with money from some of the world's most productive oil fields, became a personal bank account for a succession of generals. The rot oozed down to lawmakers, governors and judges, say Nigerian officials. Civil servants, who in some cases went months or years without receiving their salaries, collected what they could by selling their services. Corruption has grown so severe that many here fear it has become a deterrent to investors and, worse still, a reason for international leaders not to forgive Nigeria's crushing foreign debt of $35 billion. In an address to the nation in March, Obasanjo warned that corruption ""contaminates collective morality and values"" and tarnishes the image of Nigeria in the eyes of the world. ""This is a warning to all those who have tendencies to be corrupt,"" he said. ""This administration is fully poised to deal ruthlessly with corruption in all its ramifications."" Many Nigerians dismiss Obasanjo's anti-corruption campaign as an elaborate form of public relations to win concessions from lenders and burnish the president's reputation as a world leader. Critics note that only now, six years after Obasanjo first won office promising to crack down on corruption, are any major figures being brought to justice, and none has gone to jail. Political opponents also contend that the president's election victories in 1999 and 2003 were so brazenly rigged that he lacks the moral authority to attack corruption. ""It is still too early to start clapping,"" said Ibrahim Modibbo, spokesman for the main opposition party here, the All Nigeria People's Party. ""We strongly believe the whole thing is a smoke screen."" Efforts to stem corruption began making headlines in August 2003 when Nasir Ahmad el-Rufa'i, who had just been named to a ministerial post overseeing the capital region, announced that two senators had asked him for bribes to facilitate his confirmation. According to el-Rufa'i, one of the two senators told him he needed 55 votes, which would cost him 54 million naira, or roughly $415  --  1 million naira each for 54 senators but nothing for himself. He was such an admirer of the nominee, he said, that his vote was free. Both men named by el-Rufa'i have denied his allegations and been cleared of wrongdoing by a legislative committee. El-Rufa'i won confirmation anyway, and he has since become an outspoken symbol and advocate of the anti-corruption campaign. In a recent interview, el-Rufa'i estimated that at least three out of every four lawmakers are corrupt, as are more than half of the nation's governors and many of its civil servants. Most of the cabinet ministers and the nation's top judges are clean, he said, but in the lower levels of the judiciary, bribery is more common. He maintained, however, that Nigeria is beginning to change, if only because corrupt government officials have begun to fear that they might get caught  -- and punished. ""We are moving away from a culture of impunity, where people felt they could be corrupt and get away with it, to the point where people are scared of being corrupt,"" el-Rufa'i said. ""If a few more ministers go to jail, if a few more members of the National Assembly go to jail, believe me, people will line up and do the right thing."""1-Jun-05,NIGERIA (99%); SAO TOME & PRINCIPE (93%); AFRICA (92%),"ELECTED TO a second term in 2003, Nigeria's president, Olusegun Obasanjo, has promised to clean up corruption. He has shown some signs of seriousness: Investigations have triggered the sacking of two government ministers, the arrest of a former police chief and the resignation of the Senate president. But the key test of Mr. Obasanjo's commitment is oil. Nigeria pumps 3 percent of the world's crude, and oil is the source of the cronyism that has suffocated Nigerian development since independence. In the oil sphere Mr. Obasanjo has made the right noises. Last year Nigeria was one of four African countries to sign up to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, an international effort to promote the publication of payments  oil and mining firms make to governments. The government has appointed a Western audit firm to certify that its oil accounts are accurate; the hope is that published revenue that can be monitored by advocacy groups and the media will not be diverted into ministers' pockets. Nigerians even suggest that their new openness will serve as a model for Africa's burgeoning oil sector. ""I rejoice greatly that Nigeria is and will continue to be at the forefront of the continent's new transparent dawn,"" Mr. Obasanjo declared in February 2004. The quote is displayed prominently on the transparency initiative's Web site. Recently, however, the dawn has been looking a bit bleak. Some of Nigeria's oil fields are shared with the tiny nation of Sao Tome and Principe, and the allocation of exploration rights there  smells bad. According to a Nigerian press report, a firm run by a politically connected Nigerian seems favored to win an auction over a U.S. contender that bid substantially more; several other bidders appear to stand out for their links to the government rather than for their knowledge of geology or engineering. The first payment generated by this auction process has been made into a Nigerian bank controlled (again, according to a Nigerian press report) by the family of the recently sacked Senate president, a move that violated the anti-corruption best practice of depositing it in an international bank. Despite promises of transparency, an exploration contract with Chevron and Exxon Mobil so far has not  been published. The plan seems to be to release part of it, eventually. Sao Tome's government has protested  the conduct of the bidding process and demanded a fresh auction. But it's not clear whether Mr. Obasanjo will listen. The president inserted himself directly into the argument this month by visiting Sao Tome; according to one account, his message to his counterpart was to allow the flawed auction to stand. Mr. Obasanjo is no doubt under considerable pressure from corrupt elites at home. But if he wants to change Nigeria's dismal development record, he should live up to his fine rhetoric."6-Apr-07,NORTHERN AFRICA (79%); MIDDLE EAST (79%); AFRICA (79%),"The World Bank rank and file were most upset by our recent column noting that Shaha Riza, linked romantically with bank President Paul Wolfowitz, got some curiously hefty raises upon being detailed to work at the State Department -- but remaining on the bank's payroll. ""Since publication of the . . . column,"" a bank-wide e-mail Wednesday from the bank's staff association said, the association ""has been inundated with messages from staff expressing concern, dismay and outrage."" The association ""has looked into those concerns"" and concluded that, while it couldn't ""determine who drew up and approved"" the agreement detailing Riza to State -- which the bank said was necessary to avoid a conflict of interest -- it did find that the terms are ""grossly out of line with"" bank rules. Riza, a senior communications officer for the Middle East and North Africa region, was promoted to a higher-paying position on Sept. 19, 2005, the day she left for Foggy Bottom, without any of the required open competition for the job, the association said. She also got a pay raise more than double the amount allowed by the rules, the e-mail said, followed by another allegedly overly large raise. Before these bumps up, Riza had been earning $132,660. She's now paid $193,590. (Correction: We said last week that this figure was about $7,000 a year more than what is paid to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, for whom Riza now works. That now appears to be very misleading. Riza's reported pay is net, we're told, and Rice's is gross. So Riza takes home a whole lot more than Rice. We regret the error.) The association said that in general it ""defends a staff member's right to have"" the bank ""preserve the confidentiality of certain information -- and we deplore this leak of a staff member's confidential salary information. However, in this case, the information shared with the press reveals a violation of the staff rules and therefore seems to us a clear case of whistleblowing."" The sharply worded e-mail called on the bank's board and top officials to ""explain how/why the rules were bent in this case"" and noted that ""this is not the first instance of such staff rule violations by the current World Bank Group management."" The association e-mail -- and other bank observers -- questioned how this matter squared with Wolfowitz's anti-corruption drive, which demands that recipients of World Bank loans crack down on graft, nepotism and so on. ""It's ironic that Mr. Wolfowitz lectures developing countries about good governance and fighting corruption, while winking at an irregular promotion and overly generous pay increases to a partner,"" said Bea Edwards, international director of the Government Accountability Project, which first disclosed the pay data. Foreign Policy magazine's editors opined that ""given Wolfowitz's crusade to fight corruption in countries that receive Bank aid, doesn't it seem a little hypocritical to hand your girlfriend inordinate bonuses?"" But these criticisms tend to assign some blame to Wolfowitz, even though his spokesman has assured us that matters involving Riza's ""arrangements"" were made ""at the direction of the bank's board of directors."" And Riza's successor for the Middle East and North Africa region, Karem Elsharkawy, in an e-mail yesterday to his colleagues, implored them to ""maintain a balanced position and be rational and fair."" No wrongdoing has been proven, he said, and until then ""we must give our colleague the benefit of all reasonable doubt."" Market Watch Rep. Mike Pence (R-Ind.), in an op-ed yesterday in USA Today, revised and extended his remarks on how safe he found the Shorja market in Baghdad. ""We milled around for more than an hour,"" he wrote. ""I told reporters afterward that it was just like any open-air market in Indiana in the summertime. I didn't mean that Baghdad was as safe as the Bargersville Flea Market; I just meant that that was what it looked and felt like: lots of people, lots of booths and a friendly relaxed atmosphere."" Well, there are few places on earth as safe as the Bargersville Flea Market. But you know, if you ignored your flak jacket, the scores of heavily armed troops, the military choppers overhead and those armored Humvees circling about, it probably did feel pretty much like most other Indiana markets. Ah, to Be in Brussels . . . Credit the State Department for spectacular timing. Less than a day after GOP mega-fundraiser and Swift Boat donor Sam Fox received a recess appointment to be ambassador to Belgium, BNET, the department's internal television station, was airing a guide to diplomatic living in Brussels. It came complete with suggestions for embassy staff on fine dining, shopping (luxury items, household supplies, food, plants, entertainment, etc.), children's activities and schools in the city. ""Brussels is a very big city with countless parks,"" a narrator says. ""Parks and ponds abound. . . . Belgium is an explorer's paradise."" The video included shots of pristine parks, the insides of delis and supermarkets, video rental stores, bookshops. The half-hour video is titled ""Post Video: A Taste of Brussels."" And of course there's the statue of that kid peeing in the fountain and the absolute best thing about Brussels: Paris is only 1  hour  22 minutes away by train. The next video featured a report on living in Thailand. Sounds Like the Man for the Job The White House has tapped Michael G. Vickers, a former Army Special Forces officer and CIA operations officer, to be assistant secretary of defense for SOLIC (Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict). Vickers, now at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, played a key role in the CIA's army of the Afghan resistance to the Soviets. His background should help him navigate the often bruising bureaucratic tussles in his new job: He was once stabbed in the leg teaching knife fighting and other hand-to-hand combat techniques at West Point."14-Apr-13,SIERRA LEONE (94%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%),"FREETOWN, Sierra Leone -- The health statistics in this battered land, still scarred from a decade of civil war, are so alarming that for a decade, donors have opened their wallets to help improve some of the world's worst rates of maternal and infant mortality. This is the third-most dangerous place on earth to have a baby, and one of the most perilous to be a baby. Millions of donor dollars later, health statistics show that the ''crisis'' for mothers and babies, as the British government called it, may be lessening. But one crisis appears to have spawned another: In a place where most of the population lives on less than a dollar a day, the incoming rush of health care aid has been dazzling. Too dazzling, apparently. Last month, the country's 29 top health officials found themselves indicted by Sierra Leone's anticorruption agency on charges of misappropriating a half-million dollars in grants from a global vaccine provider, GAVI Alliance, started by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The amount may not seem huge in some places, but in Sierra Leone, one of the least developed nations in the world, it looms particularly large, and the list of suspects is stunning. The country's top doctor -- the chief medical officer, Dr. Kizito Daoh -- was among those indicted. So were the director of primary health care at the Health Ministry, the permanent secretary at the Health Ministry and the ministry's program manager for reproductive health. Much of the ministry's leadership, the key agency in tackling some of the continent's worst health outcomes, now finds itself charged with wrongdoing, including eight doctors. ''You have a ministry without a head,'' said the World Bank representative here, Francis Ato Brown. ''It's virtually decapitated the ministry,'' he said of the indictments, adding that they had ''the potential to virtually destroy the health care system.'' The officials took money from the vaccine funds to hold workshops and training seminars, for instance -- and then could not prove that these sessions had been held, officials say. But that may have been just a piece of the problem. Investigators say they have found evidence of large houses and expensive cars not consistent with official salaries, as well as kickbacks from suppliers. The vaccine alliance froze about $4.2 million in coming grants in November, as a country that had been a poster child for health care projects -- Britain and others have financed a free health care program for mothers and children that has reduced malaria rates -- suddenly became a cautionary tale. Investigators have found nurses illegally selling drugs to patients in the free care program and doctors charging for services that were, according to the donor terms, supposed to be free. Government auditors have found tens of thousands of dollars withdrawn from an internationally financed maternal and child health program, with no records for how the money was spent; at hospitals in the interior, and at the central medical store in Freetown, they have found no records to support the dispensing of drugs worth thousands of dollars; and they could not find records for 23 of the Health Ministry's 55 bank accounts. Record-keeping has been ''abysmal,'' an anticorruption investigator wrote in a report. The vaccine alliance first noticed problems in an internal review. And last week i t released an audit report that found tens of thousands of dollars in unjustified uses of finances and cash withdrawals, ambulances for which the Health Ministry paid almost twice as much as it should, and over a dozen motorcycles improperly distributed. The audit showed ''very high exposure of this grant to misuse,'' the report concluded. But Sierra Leone officials themselves, including the Anti-Corruption Commission and the auditor general, are the ones who are sounding alarms, motivated by the knowledge that outside aid represents 20 percent of national income. ''There is evidence of cash withdrawals, and we haven't seen what's been done with the cash,'' said Joseph F. Kamara, the head of the Anti-Corruption Commission, whose headquarters are in an old church office building next to the Anglican cathedral downtown. ''They were claiming money for supervising work that was never done.'' ''We've seen a pattern,'' the misappropriation of health funds, ''clearly being replicated elsewhere,'' he said. Mr. Kamara has 161 people working for him, and they clamber up and down the narrow stairs of the old church building in this sweltering seaside capital. On the worn wooden door of his office is a sticker in the local Krio language exhorting that ''corruption must be talked about.'' The charges against the country's top physicians have also shocked the public in Sierra Leone. ''There's a perception that doctors are meant to heal wounds, not bleed them,'' Mr. Kamara said. His predecessor obtained a corruption conviction against the former health minister, Sheiku Koroma. Health care ''is an area that has long been corrupt,'' said Abdul Tejan-Cole, the former anticorruption commissioner, who resigned three years ago after receiving threats. Top doctors, including at the Health Ministry, ''refuse to go to the hospital'' because ''it's much more lucrative to manage a donor project,'' Mr. Tejan-Cole said. ''Across the board in public-sector funds, a lot is going wrong. There's a lot of misappropriation and abuse.'' Dr. Daoh, the chief medical officer who has been indicted, was sitting on the patio of his two-story house reading the Koran on a recent Saturday afternoon. He complained that the government kept putting off his day in court and said that ''nobody has asked my side of the story,'' before declining to comment. The anticorruption chief, Mr. Kamara, boasted about the speed with which he had obtained indictments, but doubts have been raised about whether they will hold up, and whether the volume of indictments was intended primarily to impress donors. ''The indictments were hurriedly done,'' said a knowledgeable former top government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Nonetheless, even the official, who was critical of Mr. Kamara, agreed that a crime had been committed with the missing vaccine funds. ''We can describe this as a reversal of a moral ethos,'' Mr. Kamara said. The doctors ''should have been there for the victims, but it turns out that they are the perpetrators of the victims' predicament.'' ''It introduces a state of hopelessness in health security,'' he added. ''You have nowhere to turn to.''"12-Jan-08,SOUTH AFRICA (94%); AFRICA (92%),"JOHANNESBURG-- A decision by the African National Congress this week to investigate a murky, multibillion-dollar arms deal has reopened a deeply divisive affair that has dogged the government of President Thabo Mbeki and his onetime deputy Jacob Zuma for nearly a decade. The 1999 purchase of fighter jets, frigates and other heavy armaments from several European firms repeatedly violated basic procurement procedures, with the final selections of contractors sometimes running contrary to the advice of top military officials, according to news reports and other accounts. And when the controversy first developed, Mbeki and his political allies fought strenuously to limit the investigations, the reports say. The unanswered questions about the deal have returned to the forefront of South African politics in recent months, grabbing newspaper headlines while exerting a potentially profound influence on the fate of the country's most powerful politicians. In peril are Mbeki's legacy after two terms as South Africa's president and Zuma's bid to succeed him in 2009. ""The reason that it continues to bedevil South African politics, and this is where Thabo Mbeki was absolutely crucial, is that they were prepared to undermine the institutions of democracy to protect themselves from a proper investigation of the arms deal,"" said Andrew Feinstein, a former ANC member of Parliament who quit in 2001 to protest the party's handling of the deal. ""And a number of those institutions have never recovered, including Parliament."" The arms deal is at the center of criminal charges of fraud, corruption and racketeering against Zuma, who unseated Mbeki as leader of the ANC last month. Zuma's allies have long maintained that the allegations against him are less serious than those that potentially could be leveled against Mbeki, who headed a committee that made crucial decisions about which arms dealers won contracts. In his recent book, ""After the Party: A Personal and Political Journey Inside the ANC,"" Feinstein describes a meeting in November 2000 in which Mbeki's closest aide and lifelong friend, Essop Pahad, angrily asked Feinstein why he was ""questioning the integrity of the government, the ministers and the president."" Soon after that, party leaders removed Feinstein from the investigative committee, and he resigned from Parliament the following year. Mbeki also blocked a special anti-corruption unit led by a tenacious former judge from making its own inquiries. The government investigation exonerated Mbeki and other officials, but Feinstein and others contend that Mbeki's office dictated an extensive, last-minute rewrite of the report. Mbeki's spokesman, Mukoni Ratshitanga, cited that report this week in saying that the president did nothing improper during the arms deal and did not object to the party's investigation of the matter. But many in South Africa's political community say the party's action shows that the ANC has turned against Mbeki less than a month after Zuma defeated him as leader. The investigative panel includes Zuma's deputy, Kgalema Motlanthe, and the party's treasurer general, Mathews Phosa. ""It's because of the infighting in the ANC that they really want to open this up again,"" said Patricia de Lille, leader of the opposition Independent Democrats and an early critic of the arms deal. South African journalists have detailed links among Mbeki, his political allies and successful bidders. They include a December 1998 meeting in Paris between Mbeki and the top executives of one of the arms companies. Ongoing investigations in Germany and Britain, home to successful bidders in the arms deal, have alleged there were millions of dollars in bribes, though prosecutors in those countries have not filed any charges. Feinstein estimated that the bribes, kickbacks and other irregular payments totaled $200 million and said some of the money went to the ANC. Party leaders declined to say this week whether they would release the findings of their new probe. South African prosecutors have focused mainly on Zuma and his financial adviser, Schabir Shaik, who in 2005 was convicted of soliciting bribes for Zuma from a French arms dealer. Mbeki fired Zuma soon after Shaik was convicted, but prosecutors have run into repeated problems in pursuing Zuma himself. A court dismissed all charges against him in 2006 because of technical problems with the indictments. Prosecutors refiled the corruption charges, along with 14 new ones, on Dec. 28, one week after he became head of the ANC. Zuma's lawyer and political allies have sharply criticized the timing of the new indictments, which they say result from a political vendetta. The trial, due to start in August, is the most important obstacle Zuma faces in his bid to succeed Mbeki as South Africa's president. Zuma has packed key party committees with his allies, and party leaders this week said he will be the ANC's nominee for president. The ANC so dominates South African politics that the nominees of other parties would have little chance to beat him. If Zuma is convicted on any of the charges rising from the arms deal, however, he would be ineligible to take the job."15-Jun-05,SOUTH AFRICA (94%); AFRICA (94%),"President Thabo Mbeki fired his deputy and heir apparent Tuesday after he was implicated in a corruption scandal, throwing open the question of who will become the next leader of South Africa. Jacob Zuma, 63, who enjoyed widespread support among the population and the labor union movement, had been groomed to take the helm of Africa's economic and diplomatic powerhouse when Mbeki steps down in 2009. But Mbeki told a special joint session of Parliament that because of a high court judge's ruling that Zuma had a ""generally corrupt"" relationship with his financial adviser, he was being dismissed from his post and from the cabinet. ""In the interest of the honorable deputy president, the government, our young democratic system and our country, it would be best to release the honorable Jacob Zuma from his responsibilities,"" Mbeki said. Zuma said he accepted his dismissal, but maintained he had done nothing wrong. ""All of us should put national unity above everything else,"" he told reporters. ""Our freedom and democracy are more important than us as individuals."" Youthful Zuma supporters stopped traffic in downtown Durban in a demonstration of their loyalty to him. The Congress of South African Trade Unions said it was ""devastated."" Zuma's longtime adviser, Schabir Shaik, was sentenced June 8 to 15 years in prison for corruption and fraud. The court found that Shaik made payments to Zuma totaling $178,000 to fund a lavish lifestyle, in violation of anti-corruption legislation. It also said Zuma was aware of his friend's efforts to secure him bribes from a French arms dealer. No charges have been brought against Zuma. Former president Nelson Mandela said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the news but supported Mbeki's decision. Opposition leaders praised Mbeki's decision. ""We have shown the world that South Africa is not among those nations who allow corruption to unravel the fabric of their country's soul,"" said Tony Leon, leader of the main opposition Democratic Alliance. Mbeki did not immediately announce a new deputy president. Local news media speculated that the national chairman of the African National Congress, Defense Minister Mosiuoa Lekota, was the top contender. Zuma, a former guerrilla fighter who was imprisoned for 10 years during the apartheid era, remains hugely popular within the ANC and its allies."23-Jul-14,"TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (94%); AFRICA (92%);","It was hard to miss Daria at the World Forum on Governance in Prague in April. The 28-year-old lawyer and mother from Kiev was wearing a ""Ukraine: [expletive] Corruption"" T-shirt. Such a frank message was understandable. Indignation at ""grand corruption"" - the abuse of public office for personal profit by a nation's leaders - inspired Daria and many others to risk their lives in the Maidan protests that toppled President Viktor Yanukovych in February. In too many nations, corruption is endemic at the highest levels of government. Then-U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan was correct in characterizing such behavior as an ""insidious plague"" in his 2003 statement upon the adoption of the U.N. Convention Against Corruption. Corruption is extraordinarily costly, consuming more than 5 percent of the global gross domestic product. Developing regions lose more than 10 times in illicit financial flows than what they receive in foreign aid. Russia's corruption-fueled ""shadow economy"" makes up an estimated 44 percent  of its GDP. Corrupt governments also often provide havens for international criminals, including drug lords in Mexico and terrorists in countries such as Afghanistan and Yemen. Nevertheless, the most serious consequence of grand corruption is that it destroys democracy and devastates the human rights that governments are constituted to protect. Countries recognized as among the world's most corrupt - including Somalia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Iraq and Syria - repeatedly violate the human rights of their citizens. The poor and powerless are victims of corrupt regimes throughout the world. As Ukraine and Egypt exemplify, opposition to grand corruption is destabilizing many countries and, indeed, the world. International efforts to combat grand corruption have obviously been inadequate. Similar circumstances concerning the evils of genocide and other intolerable human rights abuses led to the creation of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 2002. An International Anti-Corruption Court (IACC) is now equally necessary. Grand corruption depends on the culture of impunity that exists in many nations. An IACC would provide an alternative and effective forum for the enforcement of the laws criminalizing grand corruption that exist in virtually every country, while giving force to the requirements of treaties such as the U.N. Convention Against Corruption and the obligations of organizations such as the World Trade Organization. Like the ICC, an IACC would operate on the principle of complementarity, meaning that only officials from those countries unable or unwilling to prosecute grand corruption properly would be subject to prosecution. This would give many nations a significant incentive to strengthen and demonstrate their capacity to combat grand corruption. An IACC would be comparable to the approach that has served the United States well. In the United States, we do not depend on elected state prosecutors to address corruption by state and local officials because such prosecutors are often part of the political establishment they would be called upon to police and, in any event, generally lack the necessary legal authority and resources. Instead, we rely primarily on federal investigators, prosecutors and courts to deal with corrupt state and local officials. Similarly, an IACC would employ an elite corps of investigators expert at unraveling complex financial transactions and prosecutors experienced in preparing and presenting complicated cases. It would also include experienced, impartial international judges. The IACC's impact would be enhanced if, like federal courts in the United States, it were also empowered to hear civil fraud and corruption cases. An international ""whistleblower"" statute enforceable at the IACC would increase the resources that would be devoted to combating fraud and corruption and enhance the potential for restitution for victims. Notably, an IACC should have strong support from the United States. U.S. companies generally behave ethically and, in addition, are significantly deterred from paying bribes by the threat of prosecution for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. They would benefit from the more level playing field an IACC would create. Finally, an IACC would provide the potential for more effective prosecution and punishment of corrupt officials who commonly abuse human rights. Fraud, corruption and associated money laundering can often be proved based on documentary evidence, which is easier to acquire than eyewitness testimony of victims of human rights abuses, who are unlikely to have knowledge of the criminal responsibility of their nation's leaders. There are practical impediments to establishing an International Anti-Corruption Court and principled concerns to be addressed. But the status quo is intolerable. An IACC could erode the widespread culture of impunity, contribute to creating conditions conducive to the democratic election of honest officials in countries with a history of grand corruption and honor the courageous efforts of the many people, like Daria, who are exposing and opposing corruption at great personal peril. Do corrupt governments breed political violence?  THIEVES OF STATE: Why Corruption Threatens Global Security By Sarah Chayes Norton. 262 pp. $26.95 It must be exhausting to live in a state of constant indignation. Indignant that those around you don't grasp the problem, that your proposed fixes don't win support, that matters are only getting worse each day. Welcome to Sarah Chayes's world. Yet somehow Chayes doesn't seem exhausted. In ""Thieves of State,"" she is determined. The target of her zeal is government corruption around the world - an old challenge but one she recasts in urgent and novel terms. The trouble with fraud and bribery and the rest is not simply their moral evil or economic toll, Chayes argues. The real danger is that an abusive government can elicit violent responses, including religious extremism, putting the survival of the state at risk. The case she makes is anecdotal but alarming. Chayes, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment, is something of a rarity among Washington analysts. The places she writes about (Afghanistan, Egypt, Tunisia, Uzbekistan and Nigeria, among others) she knows well, not in the fly-in-for-a-week-then-pitch-an-op-ed kind of way. A former NPR correspondent who covered Algeria's civil war in the 1990s and the fall of the Taliban after 9/11, Chayes went on to launch a business in Afghanistan, advise coalition forces there and work for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. She's been on all sides of the problem - at times, she admits, even inadvertently causing it. Her corruption travelogue centers on Afghanistan, where she saw how even low-level abuses alienated the population. She begins with Nurallah, a former policeman whose brother was struck by a police officer because he refused to pay a bribe. ""My sacred oath,"" Nurallah seethes. ""If I see someone planting an IED on a road, and then I see a police truck coming, I will turn away. I will not warn them."" Chayes points to the fraudulent 2009 Afghan elections, which so discouraged citizens that the vote may have boosted support for the insurgency. And she shares her own story of working with the family of then-Afghan President Hamid Karzai in the early 2000s, hoping to establish a nonprofit group only to conclude that, through her indifference to murky accounting practices, ""I had enabled the development of a corrupt system under my very eyes."" Chayes scatters her tale with passages from old political tracts warning rulers of the consequences of corrupt behavior. ""Being rapacious and arrogating subjects' goods and women is what, above all else . . . renders [the prince] hateful,"" Machiavelli wrote, and ""leaves a mind obstinate to vengeance."" Eleventh-century Persian writer Nizam al-Mulk cautioned that a government's ability to administer justice and hold officials accountable was key to its survival. Such works of advice for rulers, written by state officials or clerics, have historically been known as ""mirrors,"" and ""Thieves of State"" reflects that tradition. The Arab Spring, Chayes contends, ""amounted to a mass uprising against kleptocratic practices."" She singles out a few characters who crystallized popular revulsion, such as Hosni Mubarak's son Gamal, who with a clique ""hijacked"" the Egyptian state, ""rewriting the laws, awarding themselves privileged access to land and other public resources."" Or Tunisia's Leila Trabelsi, dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali's second wife, whose clan manipulated the customs agency and the Finance Ministry. In Uzbekistan, where Chayes says the aging dictator's eldest daughter is involved in faux charities, telecom sector bribery and possibly even sex trafficking, parts of the population are turning to religion. ""People are becoming more devoted because they are more and more frustrated with the government,"" a local human rights activist told Chayes. ""They are turning to God for recourse."" The same has occurred in Nigeria, Chayes reports, where the battle for oil riches has wrought a ""generalized ethical collapse."" Among the country's Christians and Muslims, the ""puritanical focus on personal behavior has increased in recent decades, as corruption metastasized beyond the confines of officialdom to infect nearly all Nigerians' behavior."" Chayes contends that governments in such countries, so often dismissed as weak or failed states, are in fact powerful and organized - but for crime rather than social services. The government of Afghanistan ""could best be understood not as a government at all but as a vertically integrated criminal organization,"" she writes, ""whose core activity was not in fact exercising the functions of a state but rather extracting resources for personal gain."" The Egyptian government is described in similar terms, except with two networks, the military and Mubarak's, vying for power. We know which prevailed. Chayes's descriptions can be vivid - she writes of ""the emaciated bundle of torqued nerves that was General Stanley McChrystal"" - but also overwrought. She is not just disappointed by the Karzai brothers; she feels ""the laceration of shattered illusions."" Chayes doesn't just make calls after a police chief is assassinated, but ""pacing hard, my blood oddly cold, phone welded to the side of my head, I quested for facts."" Quested? Her outrage isn't directed only at corrupt officials but at their enablers in the West, too. She writes that CIA payments to Karzai and to his younger brother Ahmed Wali - ""I had watched officers hand him a tinfoil-wrapped package of bills when I was over at his house for dinner one 2003 night"" - undercut anti-corruption efforts targeting their networks. But even sympathetic Western officials have it backward, she says: They think, ""First let's establish security, then we can worry about governance."" What if corruption is causing insecurity? Few U.S. officials, military or civilian, get much love from Chayes. She admired McChrystal and his team that took over the Afghan war in 2009, ""but I had underestimated the accompanying arrogance."" When Gen. David Petraeus succeeded McChrystal the following year, Chayes was initially encouraged by his commitment to the corruption fight but then baffled when he seemed to lose interest. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton submitted a memo to the Obama administration's national security team addressing corruption in Afghanistan, but Chayes dismisses it as ""faulty analysis"" and ""an attempted end run around the whole issue,"" in part because it punted most of the responsibility to the Pentagon. Only Adm. Michael Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, comes off well. (In the acknowledgments, she thanks him ""for being a prince and tolerating my jagged shards of mirror."") Like all books about one big idea, ""Thieves of State"" is a bit obsessive. In Chayes's eyes, revolts against corruption explain the origins of democracy, the Protestant Reformation, even the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. ""Perhaps Al Qaeda's main intent was not to kill a large number of Americans so much as to visit a spectacular symbolic punishment upon the manifestations of what it saw as a criminal kleptocracy that controlled the most powerful instruments of force on earth,"" she writes. That's a big bite of perhaps. Chayes concludes with a litany of policy recommendations: The United States and other governments should establish clear anti-corruption policies. Intelligence agencies should include systemic corruption in their annual assessments of U.S. security threats. Corrupt officials should have their visas denied or delayed, and should be the targets of financial sanctions. Contracting guidelines, monitoring and evaluation for aid packages should be strengthened. And in order to create an ""international climate of disapproval,"" important multilateral meetings should not be held in corrupt countries. Given the scope of the challenge Chayes outlines, these proposals feel somewhat muted. She admits that she has been ""struggling over the years to tone down my off-putting stridency."" I hope she doesn't tone it down too much. Righteous Sarah Chayes is more interesting than wonky Sarah Chayes. A clearer mirror. Read more from Book Party: Inside the mind of the Pentagon's 'Yoda' The time Obama walked in on a staffer who had a friend in bed Chuck Todd's daily rundown of the Obama presidency Tanzania Torn as It Tries to Make Ends Meet  Tanzanian politics involve a good deal of self-analysis and what some would consider interminable debate. Although this is a one-party state, politicians here like to say, at least the party's laundry is washed in public. The latest topic of discussion is corruption, a phenomenon common in much of Africa but once viewed as foreign by Tanzania, which has regarded itself as virtuous and egalitarian. Perhaps because the party chairman and former President, Julius K. Nyerere, set such high standards - a Leadership Code adopted in 1967 forbade party leaders from owning rental property, from earning more than one salary or from holding shares in a private company - the difference between the ideal and the reality has been stark. Bribery, Tanzanians say, has gripped the economic system for the last decade. Some people with wide experience in Africa say the payoffs are so pervasive that Tanzania is beginning to go the way of Zaire, where bribery is the usual way of doing business. After much debate at a meeting of its national executive committee, the governing party announced last week that its leaders would be required to declare their assets. Those suspected of having excessive holdings will be called before an investigative commission of nine elder party statesmen, the leadership said. Public Has Its Doubts A few days later the public was invited to express its opinion on the anti-corruption drive. The reaction, prominently displayed on the front page of the Government-run newspaper, was overwhelmingly skeptical. The campaign to stamp out corruption, a secretary wrote, will be ''the same as many other party and Government directives which died natural deaths.'' A restaurant receptionist said corruption should have been fought earlier. ''It is already in people's blood,'' she said. A lecturer at the party's ideological college said: ''We have the Anti-Corruption Squad under the President's office, the Permanent Commission of Inquiry, the Leadership Code, the Control and Discipline Commission of the Party and courts of law. What else do we need?'' Desperately low Government salaries are at the root of the problem. A senior official in a prominent ministry said that his salary was the equivalent of $70 a month, a that this was a premium wage. He was promoted to the post nine months ago after serving in a number of other not-quite-so-senior positions. Because of the sluggishness of the bureaucracy, he has yet to receive a paycheck in his new post. He is able to survive, he said, because his wife is working and his rent, electricity and telephone bills are paid by the Government. A Way of Getting By ''Say a guy doesn't have a wife who is working,'' he said. ''What does he do? He accepts money.'' A study last year by a Western donor said that a family of five needs 300 Tanzanian shillings, or about $1.50, to meet its daily food requirements. By that standard, a low-income head of household would earn enough to cover only one-third of his family's food needs, with nothing remaining for other expenses. Government clerks expect some payment if files are to be found speedily. Mid-level civil servants often spend just 30 percent of their working hours on official business because they are too busy earning a living on the outside. Popular ways of earning extra income include raising chickens, and selling the eggs, and tending cows and selling the milk. To keep up these outside projects, a civil servant will use his Government contacts, pulling strings to get a quick allocation of chicken feed, for example, a Tanzanian economist said. Economists say much of the country's bountiful natural wealth - gold, rubies, tanzanite - is smuggled across the border into Kenya with the collusion of Government officials, with no benefit to public coffers."26-Feb-06,UGANDA (94%); AFRICA (93%); NIGERIA (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (79%),"President Yoweri Museveni was declared the winner of Uganda's first multiparty elections in 25 years, according to results released Saturday, extending the rule of one of Africa's longest-serving presidents. His main challenger, Kizza Besigye, immediately rejected the results, saying the count was ""illegal."" Museveni, who took power in a military coup in 1986, won 59 percent of the vote, the country's Electoral Commission announced. Besigye, the president's former ally and physician, received 37 percent. The race was watched across the continent as a test for Africa's young democracies and their leaders, who historically have been reluctant to leave office. Last year, Uganda's parliament changed the constitution, which had limited the chief executive to two terms. Chad recently altered its constitution to allow President Idriss Deby to seek a third term later this year, and Nigeria is considering a similar move. After the results were announced, thousands of Museveni supporters spilled into the streets of Kampala, the capital, wearing the party's yellow shirts and donning  the  wide-brimmed safari hats that are Museveni's trademark. ""No change,"" they sang, giving the thumbs-up signal. At Besigye's headquarters, the challenger's supporters held up posters of their candidate and sang, ""Please, Museveni, go home to your cows,"" a reference to his rural roots. Riot police lined the streets in the area, and some of Besigye's supporters threw rocks at them. Police fired tear gas into crowds, but there were no reports of serious violence or arrests. ""We know we can't really do anything or we will suffer the bullet,"" said Mohammed Ssekend, 26, a real estate broker and Besigye supporter, before he took off running down the street. Besigye's party, the Forum for Democratic Change, lost to Museveni in a turbulent election in 2001, and he asked his supporters to remain calm and ignore the findings of the Electoral Commission. ""It is disgraceful that the government has decided to use its power to terrorize people,"" said Besigye, who was visibly upset, adding that his party would release an independent vote count. International monitors also criticized the election, saying the campaign was ""never a level playing field from the start,"" according to a report by the European Union. The independent Monitor media group, the country's largest newspaper and radio company, said the government shut down its radio signal and Internet site and warned it against releasing the results of its own vote count. ""It's very unfortunate that this is the way we strengthen democracy,"" Conrad Nkutu, the group's managing director, said in an interview. Moses K. Kizige, a spokesman for Museveni's party, said the allegations of vote rigging were untrue and warned that the army and police would put down any street protests, just as they had during the campaign. Four Besigye supporters were killed in violence leading up to the vote. Many Ugandan voters said they supported Museveni because they were afraid that change could result in instability and a return to the repression common under the governments of Idi Amin and Milton Obote, whose brutality left tens of thousands of Ugandans dead, human rights groups say. Museveni was once lauded as part of the African renaissance, a new kind of leader after a generation of military dictators, and was praised for improving the country's economy and starting a model HIV-AIDS program. But he drew the ire of international donors, which fund half the country's budget, for changing the constitution, for reports of widespread corruption in his inner circle and among the 50,000-member army, and for failing to end a 20-year war in the northern part of the country. ""Even a good dancer has to leave the stage,"" said Charles Mubbale, the Uganda director for Transparency International, an anti-corruption group, which monitored the elections. "". . . There are thousands in his military and government now who just won't leave power, and it's not healthy for the country."""20-Apr-07,"UNITED STATES (92%); AFGHANISTAN (91%); CHINA (79%); ASIA (79%); IRAN, ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF (79%); ALGERIA (79%); IRAQ (79%); AFRICA (79%)","KANO, Nigeria, April 19 -- This was Tanko Bala's life before the arrival of democracy: He had a steady job at a factory, a predictable supply of electricity in his home and a few of life's indulgences. Milk with his morning tea. Movies in the evenings. This is his life now: The factory has closed. The electricity has all but disappeared. The television has been sold along with the VCR. And the elections that arrive every four years are, in Bala's view, so thoroughly rigged that Nigeria's government seems no more a reflection of popular will than it did during the days of military rule. He expects little more from Saturday's presidential election. ""Democracy, they wanted to do good things, but the cheaters are too much,"" said Bala, 40, a thin, modest man with a wife and three daughters. ""Instead of doing work for the people, they do work for themselves."" Nigeria's corruption, rated by Transparency International as among the worst in the world, has undermined its young democracy by weakening public services and trust in elected leaders. President Olusegun Obasanjo, whose election eight years ago ended decades of military dictatorships, is leaving behind a decaying nation whose citizens are poor and increasingly frustrated. Among the casualties has been faith in democracy itself. Satisfaction with Nigeria's democracy fell from 84 percent early in Obasanjo's first term to 25 percent in 2005 among those surveyed by Afrobarometer, a polling service that measures African public attitudes. Another casualty has been the nation's infrastructure, which has deteriorated despite a massive surge in oil revenue. Billions of dollars supposedly have been spent improving Nigeria's electrical system, but poorly maintained power plants generate far fewer megawatts than they did when Obasanjo took office, prompting many Nigerians to conclude that much of the money for repairs and upgrades was simply stolen. They also blame corruption for the aging schools, crumbling roads and meager supplies of clean water. The economic toll has been severe. Here in the northern city of Kano, 500 factories once produced textiles, mattresses and prepared foods for distribution throughout West Africa. Fewer than 100 remain, and few of those operate at full capacity. Without a steady supply of electricity and water, or decent roads and railways to deliver goods, factory owners say they struggle to compete in an increasingly global, open market. Universal Textile Industries, one of the survivors, spends nearly $40,000  a month on fuel for backup generators, its general manager said. And when the power cuts off, which it does three or four times a day, thousands of spindles turning cotton into thread suddenly stop, snapping the threads. Restarting the machines takes nearly two hours. As factories closed, beggars grew more visible on Kano's streets. Massive garbage piles began attracting not just grazing goats but also desperately poor children who pick out plastic bags and bottles to sell. Others simply hold up empty plastic bowls to motorists at intersections. Some Nigerians have grown nostalgic for military rulers who once provided a rough kind of stability through price controls, trade barriers and repressive police tactics. One of the leading presidential candidates, and Bala's choice for the job, is former dictator Muhammadu Buhari, whose 20-month reign in the mid-1980s is remembered for human rights abuses but also as a pause in the personal enrichment that politicians enjoyed at the expense of citizens. ""Military rule is the best,"" Bala said, ""because the military will not allow people to do anything they want."" Nigeria, Africa's biggest oil producer and its most populous nation with 140 million people, is midway through a two-part election process. Voters cast ballots for governors and state legislators last Saturday and are to vote this Saturday for president and national legislators. Also running for president are Vice President Atiku Abubakar and Obasanjo's handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'adua, a little-known northern governor. Many analysts expect the victor to be Yar'adua, who has inherited Obasanjo's extensive political machinery. The first round of voting was marred by widespread reports of rigging, intimidation and violence, with a death toll that Nigerian newspapers put at about 50. Many polling stations opened hours late, others not at all. Observers reported that in many areas, the results clearly did not represent the will of voters. At a polling station in Kano last Saturday, many voters grew agitated as they waited for hours in stifling midday heat for ballot boxes to arrive. Azumi Tudun Nupawa, a 50-year-old homemaker wearing an olive-green headdress, said in frustration, ""I prefer the military."" The other women in the voting line -- in northern Nigeria men and women line up separately because of Muslim religious rules -- jeered at her. But Nupawa persisted with an embarrassed smile: ""The politicians are so corrupt. They are stealing so much."" Siphoning off the public wealth is nothing new in Nigeria. The nation's anti-corruption agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, has reported that $380 billion in public funds was stolen or wasted between the dawn of independence in 1960 and Obasanjo's election in 1999. Despite some high-profile prosecutions since then, many Nigerians say the problem has only grown worse under Obasanjo. The same anti-corruption agency has reported that all but five of Nigeria's governors were under investigation. The rot extends deep into the election process itself. With so much money at stake, Nigerians say, political offices are won by those who most efficiently rig votes. Maazu Mohammed Yusif, a political science professor at Bayero University in the northern state of Katsina, called Nigeria's political system ""undemocratic democracy."" Complaints grew louder this week as Obasanjo's ruling party claimed 29 of the 36 governorships. Opposition candidates demanded a delay in the presidential election to clean up the system and briefly threatened a boycott. Yet as evidence of fraud and political violence mounted, officials insisted that the state of democracy was improving. Even skeptics pointed to some signs of progress, such as a Supreme Court ruling Monday restoring Abubakar to the ballot after the electoral commission had banned him, and last year's successful effort to block Obasanjo from rewriting the constitution to allow him to run for a third term. Another such milestone, some Nigerians say, would be a peaceful inauguration of a new president. If it happens as scheduled next month, it would be the first time that one elected Nigerian president handed power to another. Information Minister Frank Nweke Jr., speaking from the capital, Abuja, acknowledged some problems with the election season but said that, overall, it had gone well. He added, ""In another 15 years, in another 20 years, we expect to have much better results than we have now."" But Bala said he has already lost patience with democracy, at least as practiced in his country. ""I don't like Nigerian democracy,"" he said, his voice edged with disappointment. At one time, though, he did. Like most Nigerians, he said, he had cheered the 1999 election that put Obasanjo in the presidency, assuming a better life would accompany freedom. Back then, the gray wires snaking into his boxy concrete house delivered electricity at night, when the city's factories were idle. But Obasanjo promised more power, which meant that appliances -- like his television and tiny stove -- might work during the day as well. Perhaps water would begin flowing through the taps, or a sewer system would replace the hand-dug ditches that carried waste into the dirt alleys where children played. Bala had even imagined that someday he might drive a motorcycle to work instead of riding a bicycle. ""We thought we were going to get lights, water and more,"" he recalled. ""But as time goes on, the suffering was more."" After the factory where he was a machine operator closed in 2004, Bala struggled to find a job. When he did, three years later, it was for a lower wage -- $3.50 a day instead of $4.25 -- with longer hours. Buying basics, such as water, rice and firewood, now consumes nearly half of his salary. And he has cut back to one major meal a day. Life might yet improve with a new government, Bala said. He voted last weekend and plans to again in the presidential election. Then he will sit in his home's tiny parlor, where the television used to be, and root for Buhari while listening to results on his radio. Even if the lights don't flicker on, as they so rarely do these days, the radio will work; it runs on batteries. ""If Buhari wins, we are expecting light,"" Bala said. ""He will force them to bring light."" Everything Has Its Price Giles Foden is the author of ''The Last King of Scotland.''  THIEVES OF STATEWhy Corruption Threatens Global Security By Sarah Chayes262 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $26.95.  Across much of the world, populations suffer daily shakedowns by the police. At roadblocks, market stalls and entrances to government buildings, thugs in uniform gather ''like spear fishermen hunting trout in a narrows,'' as Sarah Chayes writes. But that isn't the half of it. Globally, the three most important desiderata of our age -- security, resilience and poverty reduction -- are consistently being hollowed out by structural theft on a much larger scale, operating across corporations, governments, military establishments and civil services. One key reason the United States and its allies have struggled to establish sustainable democracies in Afghanistan and Iraq is that the governments of those countries are mired in graft, caught in a mafia-like system in which money flows upward. The same goes for parts of Africa and Asia, and most of the former Soviet Union. The tenure of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, is being defined by his war on corruption, and in December President Hassan Rouhani of Iran spoke out against corruption there. Chayes's ''Thieves of State'' makes a strong case that acute corruption causes not only social breakdown but also violent extremism. She calls this a ''basic fact,'' showing that where there is poor governance -- specifically, no appeal to the rule of law and no protected right of property -- people begin a search for spiritual purity that puts them on a path to radicalization. In a limited sense, this is Chayes's own story too: A former reporter for NPR in Algeria and Afghanistan, she abandoned journalism to work for a nongovernmental organization in Kandahar, then was a social entrepreneur there on her own account, finally becoming an adviser on corruption to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff. She is now a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Her personal narrative is even more complicated than any summary might suggest. In 2001, Chayes helped found a charity ''of unclear mission,'' run by President Hamid Karzai's Baltimore-based elder brother, Qayum, about whom she has this to say: ''Not for years would I begin systematically comparing his seductively incisive words with his deeds. Welded to his brother's interests, he behaved in ways that contradicted his language so starkly that for a long time I had difficulty processing the inconsistency.'' Elsewhere ''those brothers'' (there are six besides Hamid Karzai himself) are characterized as ''self-serving,'' with the younger half brother Ahmed Wali singled out as someone ''who stole land, imprisoned people for ransom, appointed key public officials, ran vast drug trafficking networks and private militias, and wielded ISAF like a weapon against people who stood up to him.'' This, mind you, was also someone at whose house Chayes had dinner one night in 2003, in the course of which she watched C.I.A. officers ''hand him a tinfoil-wrapped package of bills.'' Her experience corroborates an Oct. 27, 2009, report in The New York Times, which stated that Ahmed Wali Karzai was on the C.I.A. payroll. It also prompts one to wonder at Senator John Kerry's response at the time. ''We should not condemn Ahmed Wali Karzai or damage our critical relations with his brother, President Karzai, on the basis of newspaper articles or rumors,'' he said. Ahmed Wali Karzai was assassinated by a police official and longtime confidant on July 12, 2011. About six years before that, Chayes severed her own relationship with the Karzais. After leaving for a few months, she returned to Kandahar in May 2005 with a project that, on the surface, could never smell of corruption and intrigue. Armed with an oil press and $25,000 from Oprah Winfrey, she set up a cooperative producing scented soap and beauty products, taking advantage of Afghanistan's horticultural riches. But she soon found that even this innocuous activity put her on the sharp end of corruption, as she tried to do simple things like deposit money in a bank without paying a bribe for the privilege of doing so. So she began, in an amateurish way, to develop ideas for limiting corruption in places like Afghanistan. Very quickly, the amateur became professional. Chayes was soon called upon by NATO and ISAF to give expert briefings with a focus on anti-corruption measures. '' 'Sally the Soap-Maker Gives an Ops Brief' was how I jokingly came to refer to my main presentation,'' she writes. This led to a job with ISAF, and then another as special assistant to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, flitting between Washington and Kabul as the United States laboriously and somewhat unwillingly developed an anti-corruption strategy for Afghanistan. Any such strategy was bound to conflict with political and military exigencies, which presumably explains Kerry's response to the report in The Times. But Chayes's Afghan interlocutors told her again and again that poor governance was actually what was perpetuating the conflict, with graft generating disenchantment and driving people toward the Taliban. ''Western officials,'' she writes, ''habitually flipped the sequence: First let's establish security, then we can worry about governance.'' Ordinary Afghans, meanwhile, took Western inaction on corruption as approval. Aid just added to the problem, in Chayes's view: ''Development resources passed through a corrupt system not only reinforced that system by helping to fund it but also inflamed the feelings of injustice that were driving people toward the insurgency.'' Chayes refers to the body of medieval and Renaissance advice literature known as ''Mirrors for Princes'' to contextualize current abuses of government. She begins with the most famous mirror of all, Machiavelli's ''The Prince,'' but it is lesser-known figures like William of Pagula and John of Salisbury who give her the most ammunition. She also uses the ''Siyasat Nameh'' -- the ''Book of Politics'' -- of the 11th-century Persian administrator Nizam al-Mulk. Among the counsels that Nizam al-Mulk gave his sultan was: Listen to the griev_ances of your subjects directly, without intermediaries. Chayes argues that the _voices of a majority of Afghans are drowned out by the Taliban on one side and by the Karzai government on the other. ISAF, she says, listened only to the government. Many of the other countries Chayes brings into this chatty study (''John of Salisbury, as usual, nailed it'') show similar patterns. In each case, there are slightly different ''variations on a theme,'' as she has it, ranging from the military-_kleptocratic complex (Egypt) to the bureaucratic kleptocracy (Tunisia), the post-Soviet kleptocratic autocracy (Uzbekistan) and the resource kleptocracy (Nigeria). In her epilogue, titled ''Self-_Reflection,'' Chayes also discusses Western countries and the global financial crisis of 2008. This is an important book that should be required reading for officials in foreign service, and for those working in commerce or the military. The story will interest the nonspecialist reader too, though the balance of exciting narrative, academic discourse and policy-wonk-speak will unsettle some. Indeed, Chayes touches on how language itself becomes corrupt. The standard terminology of military and diplomatic engagement (and much corporate rhetoric) is often evasive, with usage reflecting differences in value systems -- as when assassination by drone is described as ''targeted killing.'' While I am in full agreement with what Chayes says, I found her own prose style raising my hackles on occasion, with its effortful interpolations of color (''the legendary but painfully dilapidated blue and white Mediterranean port city of Algiers''), verbs on steroids (''I wheeled and strode over to our battered red pickup truck, clambered aboard, and roared off to the bank''), and its chapters that begin with such sentences as ''Wait a second.'' I did, but I wish she had.

The German company knowingly used off-book accounts to conceal corrupt payments, mischaracterized bribes in corporate accounting and falsely described kickbacks paid to the Iraqi government in connection with the United Nations oil-for-food program, U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Taylor said in court papers  filed yesterday  in Washington. A hearing on whether to accept the Munich-based company's settlement is scheduled for Monday, said Sheldon Snook, a court spokesman. Prosecutors are recommending a fine of $450 million for the company and units in Venezuela, Argentina and Bangladesh. Under the agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, Siemens will also have to forfeit $350 million in profits and submit to monitoring to ensure compliance with anti-bribery laws. Siemens has been embroiled in a bribery scandal that was first disclosed in November 2006, leading to investigations in at least a dozen countries. The company has cooperated with prosecutors. Chief executive Peter Loescher, hired in July 2007 to clean up after the bribery scandal, replaced half of the top 100 executives and appointed division heads to eliminate decision-making by consensus on a board. The Munich Regional Court last year fined Siemens $1.33 million, the maximum fine, for bribes paid from 2001 to 2004 to government officials in Libya, Nigeria and Russia."25-May-97,"UNITED STATES (93%); AFRICA (93%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (92%); FRANCE (90%); GERMANY (90%); CANADA (79%); EUROPE (79%); JAPAN (79%);","An investigation by the Financial Times of London (May 12, 1997) concluded that Mobutu Sese Seko stole $ 4 billion. This was provided by foreign aid agencies and in bribes by multinational corporations in return for exclusive deals. Meanwhile, despite untold volumes of diamonds and other natural resources in their midst, millions of people in Zaire languished in absolute poverty. Such human rights abuses are rampant in Africa, elsewhere in the Third World and in much of the former Soviet Union. Now there is an opportunity to secure change. This week U.S. Secretary of Commerce William Daley leads the U.S. effort at the ministerial conference in Paris of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to secure agreement that the leading industrial countries should enact legislation to bar multinational corporations from paying foreign bribes. At the moment it appears that the other key Group of 7 countries (the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan) will publicly declare that they will go along with the U.S. initiative, but some skepticism may be justified. Agreements have been reached that the major industrial countries will all finalize a treaty by the end of this year to criminalize international bribery by multinational corporations and that the treaty will be ratified in 1998. But ensuring the timetable is kept and then ensuring there is enforcement may not be easy. For example, for quite some time the Germans and French have been dragging their feet when it comes to even supporting a very broad-based set of understandings. The anti-corruption issue is on the agendas because U.S. business has lobbied successfully to win administration actions that it claims can help create a ""level playing field."" The United States is alone in having a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which makes it a criminal offense for U.S. corporations to pay bribes abroad to win contracts. Companies have been caught, charged and, as Lockheed discovered a couple of years ago, fined up to $ 25 million for violating the FCPA. By contrast, Germany, for example, permits German firms to deduct their foreign bribes from their taxes. No wonder Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin stressed in a speech to World Bank ministers in late April that ""I urge all countries that continue to extend tax deductibility to bribes to act expeditiously to eliminate that practice."" Important as U.S. business interests are, there is more at stake in the anti-corruption initiative. Persistent corruption by major multinational companies across the developing world, and in Eastern Europe, has four particularly damaging effects: It distorts ""fair"" trade and makes a mockery of the concept of international competitiveness. It sustains corrupt autocrats in power (for example, look at much of the former Soviet Union, not to mention many African countries) and diminishes prospects for building democracy. It leads to a massive misallocation and waste of scarce public-sector budget resources, especially in poor countries, and so has dire human rights consequences -- in many countries palaces and sports stadiums are built while the rural and urban poor do not even have minimal health care and school facilities. It renders foreign aid programs ineffective. European and Japanese multinational corporations routinely pay bribes around the globe. After effective public criticism of its environmental and human rights policies, the Royal Dutch Shell group recently announced a new set of corporate values. But Shell avoided the bribery issue, perhaps because a lot of its business is in Nigeria, which is widely seen by business as the world's most corrupt country. Other leading European multinationals are just as shy as Shell. And no wonder, given the lack of evidence of sincere interest by European leaders in tackling the issue. The United States has done all the work, constantly pushing in the OECD and other forums and stressing that transparency in international contracting is vital. Strong anti-corruption statements by top ministers from other leading industrial nations have been noticeably absent. The new understandings on a treaty are a victory for the U.S. administration and worth applauding. But there is merit in striving now to cement the gains and keep the feet of OECD governments to the fire on this hot issue. Accordingly, the subject of international bribery should be on the agenda of the Group of 7 summit in Denver next month. President Clinton should put it on the agenda and secure some advance support for it. Calls by the president to the heads of the British and Canadian governments could just possibly win their support for a bold Denver declaration. British Prime Minister Tony Blair has, after all, started talking about giving U.K. foreign policy a humanitarian element. The U.S. needs allies in its campaign to curb corruption. Without them the leading Europeans and the Japanese are likely to continue their pro-bribery policies. The writer is vice chairman of Transparency International, a Berlin-based organization seeking to curb corruption in international business transactions."25-Apr-05,UNITED STATES (93%); MIDDLE EAST (92%); IRAQ (92%); NIGERIA (79%),"It's easy to want democracy for the Middle East. But what sort of democracy? Should American foreign policy focus on promoting elections, or on checks and balances? Is the crucial question how power is achieved? Or is it how power is exercised? Paul Collier and Anke Hoeffler, two economists at Oxford University, address these questions in a new paper on oil-rich democracies. Their answer, rooted in statistical analysis of oil states' performance since 1970 under various types of political systems, is that the tendency to focus on elections is correct in most societies but misguided in oil states. In a country such as Iraq, the United States and its allies should care at least as much about the quality of Iraq's judiciary and media as about the quality of its voting. Collier and Hoeffler are actually nicer about elections than most development economists are. Until the 1990s the research consensus held that voting was bad for economic growth, a finding that fitted with the idea that dictators are better at imposing necessary austerity. In the past decade or so, researchers have generally found that elections are more or less growth-neutral. But by taking countries with natural resources out of the sample, Collier and Hoeffler show that ordinary, resource-poor nations grow faster if they have elections. In oil states, however, the opposite holds true -- at least if elections are held in the absence of checks and balances. In countries where natural-resource profits come to a fifth of GDP, the switch from autocracy to electoral competition lowers the annual growth rate by a hefty 2.1 percentage points. Unless there are checks and balances, elections cause oil-rich countries to invest less than they should  --  and to invest badly. As a result they fail to create the public infrastructure that makes growth possible. Why might elections promote growth in most countries but cause underinvestment in oil states? In ordinary countries, where the state has limited cash at its disposal, the most efficient way to attract votes is to provide public goods: low inflation, rule of law, infrastructure that's carefully chosen to benefit the whole society. So elections promote pro-growth policies. In petro-states, by contrast, the simplest way to attract votes is to buy them. Politicians can do that by subsidizing food or handing out government jobs in exchange for loyalty, bribes that promote consumption at the expense of investment. Or they can blow money on projects whose real purpose is to generate kickbacks, so what little investment there is tends to be junky. A good example is Nigeria, which has yo-yoed between military dictatorship and corrupt democracy. In 1978 a new elected government came to power and canceled a $120 million dam contract that had been awarded by the outgoing military dictatorship. A new contract was awarded, but this time it was so padded with kickbacks that it cost an astonishing $600 million. Politicians had spent a fortune getting elected and now needed repayment. Nigeria's more recent transition to democracy, in 1999, at first seemed little better  --  a fact more recently underlined by the anti-corruption drive launched by the democratic president. By the simple expedient of requiring competitive bidding for government contracts, and by checking bid prices against prices for comparable projects posted on the Internet, Nigeria has cut the cost of public-works projects by 40 percent, saving about $2 billion since 2003. Last year the minister for public service reform abolished his own department: He had examined its 25,000-strong payroll and found 5,000 ""ghosts"" -- workers who drew salaries without ever coming to the office. So oil-rich societies need to couple elections with checks on elected authorities, as Nigeria is now attempting. This isn't true of ordinary countries; Collier and Hoeffler find that checks and balances in resource-poor countries tend to reduce growth, perhaps because they create gridlock in place of necessary public action. But in oil-rich societies a freedom of information act, an independent public prosecutor, and some separation of power over the public purse are essential to counteract incentives for corruption. This conclusion needs to register with the Bush administration. It's natural to defer to Iraqi leaders as they write their constitution this year; after all, it's their country. But the political class in any nation has few incentives to create checks on its own freedom to govern, and elections, which take place only occasionally and attract lots of healthy international attention, are easier to get right than the boring details of competitive tendering. Left to its own devices, Iraq is likely to fall into the trap that Collier and Hoeffler describe --  a constitution that focuses adequately on how power is achieved but too little on how it is exercised. mallabys@washpost.com"6-Aug-05,UNITED STATES (94%); GERMANY (92%); EUROPE (92%); SOUTHERN EUROPE (90%); AFRICA (79%); CENTRAL EUROPE (58%),"DaimlerChrysler AG's disclosure last week that the Department of Justice is investigating bribery allegations involving the car company's European executives is a sign of the U.S. government's stepped-up anti-corruption efforts targeting both domestic and non-U.S. companies, according to legal experts in the field. ""There's definitely been a substantial increase in these cases,"" said Raymond Banoun, head of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLC's business fraud practice. ""And it's non-U.S. companies that are being investigated. There's loads of these cases right now."" In a July 28 Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the German carmaker said the Justice Department had joined an SEC investigation begun last year into possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars U.S. companies from paying bribes abroad. The company said it is conducting its own investigation of ""payments from certain accounts"" that may have violated the law. A source familiar with the internal investigation said that the company made payments to government officials in Africa but that the company has not determined whether the payments were illegal. The source spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the continuing investigation. A spokesman for DaimlerChrysler declined to comment on the investigation. The probe grew out of a civil case filed last year by a former company accountant. The former employee charged in his wrongful-dismissal suit that senior DaimlerChrysler officials were aware of secret accounts used to bribe foreign officials but did nothing to stop the practice. The accountant, who worked for the company's Chrysler operation in Michigan, settled with DaimlerChrysler this year. Though DaimlerChrysler is based in Germany, it lists its stock on the New York Stock Exchange and is subject to anti-bribery laws here. The SEC, which pioneered the anti-bribery investigations in the 1970s that led to FCPA's passage in 1977, often plays a main role in many anti-bribery investigations. In a 1999 compact with the United States, European nations agreed to enact their own anti-bribery laws. Before then, bribery of officials in developing countries was common and considered a business expense. But European prosecutions of bribery allegations of companies there have been slow in coming, said Matt T. Morley, chairman of the corporate department and a managing partner of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLC's Washington office. ""The acid test is still to come"" in Europe, he said. ""Just because laws are on the books there doesn't mean they will be enforced. You haven't seen a tidal wave of cases in those countries."" Both Morley and Banoun said the Department of Justice has aggressively pursued new cases since the 1999 compact gave it expanded jurisdiction over foreign companies with a significant presence in the United States. Morley added that the Justice Department and the SEC have done these types of investigations for decades and are good at it. ""The U.S. is trying to show some leadership, so you're seeing them being very aggressive in enforcing the FCPA."" In another FCPA investigation, this one tied to Riggs Bank, New York oil company Amerada Hess Corp. disclosed yesterday that the SEC had upgraded its previously informal inquiry into Amerada's payments to the government and officials of Equatorial Guinea. The oil-rich West African country had oil payments routed to its account at Riggs Bank. Riggs's management of those accounts was a key factor in the D.C. bank's guilty plea and $16 million fine in January for failing to prevent possible money laundering. An Amerada Hess spokesperson could not be reached for comment. Other U.S. companies that have said they are being investigated for possible FCPA violations in Equatorial Guinea are Marathon Oil Corp. and ChevronTexaco Corp. A Senate investigative report last year detailed how many business deals and charitable activities the companies did in Equatorial Guinea benefited the country's ruling family. Equatorial Guinea is among the poorest countries in the world, and human rights organizations say its government is among the most repressive and corrupt in Africa."28-Jun-09,UNITED STATES (94%); KENYA (92%),"29 MONDAY 12:15 P.M.

Bellamy's announcement came one day after a presidential anti-corruption adviser, John Githongo, resigned because he was frustrated with the government's efforts at dealing with corruption. Fighting corruption needs more than a few ""honest and exemplary"" public servants who are no match ""for an executive branch of government in whose ranks the kingpins of corruption operate,"" Bellamy told the British Business Association during a luncheon. Githongo's resignation ""sounds the death knell"" on the government's fight against corruption, Kenyan human rights activists and business leaders said in a statement. *  TBILISI, Georgia -- Georgia's president nominated his finance minister as the new head of government, nearly a week after the death of Prime Minister Zurab Zhvaniya from carbon-monoxide poisoning. President Mikheil Saakashvili picked Zurab Nogaideli, 40, as prime minister after days of consultations with aides and cabinet officials, a spokeswoman said. Parliament has 10 days to approve or reject the nomination, but could vote as soon as Thursday. *  COPENHAGEN -- Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen's center-right government won a second term as Denmark voters embraced plans to keep immigration in check and taxes from rising. With nearly all 4 million ballots tallied, the governing bloc of Liberals, Conservatives and the anti-immigration Danish Peoples Party had 55 percent, giving it 96 seats in the 179-seat parliament. *  BELFAST -- Police charged a 34-year-old man with involvement in the 1998 car bombing in Omagh that killed 29 people, Northern Ireland's deadliest terrorist attack. Police arrested the suspect in the border town of Newry and charged him with stealing the car that was used by IRA dissidents in the bombing. Police withheld his name pending his formal court arraignment Wednesday. He is the third person to face charges stemming from the attack in which the dissident group, calling itself the Real IRA, asserted responsibility. *  LOME, Togo -- The African Union threatened sanctions against Togo as opposition grew to the army's installation of the son of the West African nation's longtime leader as president. The United States endorsed a call by the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States to bring about a peaceful resolution in Togo that ""will lead to free and fair elections to select a new president."" A general strike closed markets, schools and businesses in southern parts of the capital. *  HARARE, Zimbabwe -- A top official in Zimbabwe's ruling party denounced Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a Nobel peace laureate from South Africa, saying his criticisms of the government played into the hands of white racists. Zimbabwe's leaders have been widely accused of rigging elections and using violence against the opposition. Tutu, who was awarded the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his role in the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa, said Sunday that Zimbabwe made a mockery of African democracy and alienated Western donors. *  MOGADISHU, Somalia -- Militiamen fired in the direction of the speaker of Somalia's parliament as he and his delegation toured the capital's port, highlighting the challenge his government-in-exile faces as it considers returning home. No one was reported hurt. The militiamen, apparently firing from across the bay, shot near where the speaker, Shariif Hassan Sheikh Aden, was standing. Aden and about 60 lawmakers and cabinet ministers are assessing conditions in this war-ravaged country -- where they have no army or civil service -- in preparation for the government's scheduled return from Kenya this month. *  BANDA ACEH, Indonesia -- The United Nations said governments have given only a fraction of the money they pledged for tsunami aid and warned that more cash was needed to fund long-term reconstruction efforts. In Sri Lanka, corruption allegations continued to hamper relief operations. Hundreds of thousands of survivors are still in need. The United Nations urged governments to deliver promised aid. Nations have pledged $977 million, but only $360 million has reached the world body, said Margareta Wahlstrom, special envoy for Secretary General Kofi Annan. *  MANILA -- Hundreds of marines were sent to reinforce troops in the southern Philippines following fighting with followers of a jailed Muslim leader that killed at least 17 soldiers and as many as 30 rebels, officials said. The clashes erupted Monday when 500 fighters loyal to jailed leader Nur Misuari attacked government troops following an assault on their stronghold near Panamao, where guerrillas of the al Qaeda-linked Abu Sayyaf movement had allegedly sought refuge, the military said. *  GENEVA -- A U.N. human rights investigator criticized Iran over ""arbitrary arrests, torture and ill treatment"" of women and called on the Tehran authorities to abolish the death penalty. Yakin Erturk, a Turkish law professor, also urged the theocratic government to adopt an action plan to promote and protect human rights that would emphasize the elimination of violence against women. *  SAN SALVADOR -- El Salvador will replace its 380 troops in Iraq this week in a rotation of forces, the government said. El Salvador is one of a shrinking number of countries with troops deployed in the U.S.-led force in Iraq. El Salvador is the only Latin American country with troops in Iraq after Nicaragua, Honduras and the Dominican Republic pulled their forces out. --  From News Services"23-May-10,UNITED STATES (95%); GABON (93%); AFRICA (93%),"To the Editor: Nicholas D. Kristof's column about Gabon's new national parks (''Visiting Africa's Eden,'' May 16) mentions the country's oil-fueled corruption only in passing. The decades of misuse of oil revenues are at the core of Gabon's poverty paradox. Anti-corruption campaigners trying to uncover missing millions have been harassed and jailed. A United States Senate investigation published in February showed that former President Omar Bongo used loopholes in United States laws to transfer millions to bank accounts of American lobbyists. The Senate can directly help Gabonese activists and others around the world by passing the bipartisan Energy Security Through Transparency Act (S. 1700). The proposed law would require any oil company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to disclose its payments to foreign governments around the world. At a minimum, Gabon will need good governance and transparency if it has any hope of becoming Africa's Costa Rica.

Since mid-December, crime and violence have regularly shut down about 10 percent of the country's oil output. In the last week, production has been cut by nearly 20 percent -- a shortfall of 455,000 barrels daily -- amid kidnappings of foreign workers, arson against offshore oil installations, bombings of pipelines and lethal clashes between Muslims and Christians. The economic impact of the loss of Nigerian oil is magnified by other circumstances: the worsening of Iraq's oil industry, the nuclear impasse with Iran, heightening tension with Venezuela and last week's attempted suicide bombings at the main oil processing center in Saudi Arabia. The price of a barrel of crude oil spiked on Friday to nearly $63 and is unlikely to ease soon. But the world needs a stable Nigeria for reasons that go beyond oil. Nigeria is crucial to all of West Africa, having often provided the military troops and negotiating forums to quell civil war and related violence in neighboring countries. Nigeria is also important to counterterrorism efforts, both as it tries to monitor and defuse an encroaching fundamentalism among its own Muslims and in cooperating with international efforts to secure the strategically vital Gulf of Guinea. Nigeria is also now on the front lines of combating bird flu. Unfortunately, there are no easy answers to Nigeria's troubles. A big part of the problem is that the people of the country's oil-rich Niger Delta remain deeply impoverished, largely because of endemic corruption in distributing oil wealth and the historical indifference of oil companies to those economic inequities and to environmental devastation in the Delta. At the same time, the militants who claim to represent the Delta people have evolved into criminal gangs, adept at stealing huge amounts of oil to sell on black markets, the proceeds of which are used to buy ever more sophisticated weapons. Some of the current violence is a backlash against the Nigerian government's recent anti-corruption successes. But over all, Nigeria is not strong enough to solve its own problems. The Bush administration, with its good relations with Nigeria and with oil companies, is unusually well positioned to broker international arrangements that would enhance transparency in the flow of oil dollars and development in the Niger Delta. Sub-Saharan Africa is on track to double its oil production in the next 10 years, when it will likely supply up to one-fourth of America's imported oil, much of it from Nigeria. Now is the time for the American government to pay more attention to this region."9-Feb-05,UNITED STATES (96%); KENYA (94%); AFRICA (92%),"The American ambassador to Kenya, William M. Bellamy, said the United States would withhold about $2.5 million intended to help Kenya fight corruption because Kenyan officials were not seriously addressing the problem. The announcement came a day after Kenya's anti-corruption czar, John Githongo, resigned out of frustration with continuing graft in the government. President Mwai Kibaki won election in December 2002 on an anti-corruption platform, but graft has continued to thrive under his government.

The year-long effort involved 150 journalists, social scientists and researchers on six continents under the supervision of a nonpartisan Washington-based group, the Center for Public Integrity. The resulting report, released yesterday, produced a ranking of nations in which none was labeled ""very strong"" on integrity of key institutions and accountability to the public. The United States was joined by Portugal, Australia, Italy, Germany and South Africa in receiving a ""strong"" rating, while seven countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa received ""moderate"" ratings. Russia joined Panama, Indonesia, Kenya and six other countries in being rated ""weak."" Guatemala and Zimbabwe fell below that level. ""This study shows that no country, regardless of wealth, size or population, is immune from corruption"" and its ensuing problems, said Charles Lewis, the center's executive director. He said the study was meant to illuminate the ""true extent and specific nature of abuses of power"" around the globe and to help the public press for reforms. In comparing nations on a rudimentary scale of anti-corruption mechanisms, the center joins a growing number of groups shining a spotlight on governance problems that have historically been given short shrift by U.S. and allied governments, as well as by the World Bank, the European Union and other major aid donors. Only in the  past decade has corruption been regarded by key international funders as a serious hindrance to development, and only in the  past two years -- under a controversial Bush administration foreign aid program known as the Millennium Challenge  Account -- has the United States emphasized good governance as a key condition for economic assistance. But donors' attitudes toward corruption are slowly being changed by the work of groups such as Transparency International, which annually surveys corruption in 34 countries with financial support from Britain, Germany, the United States and private foundations. ""Legal regimes governing political finance are generally inadequate"" everywhere, Transparency International said in its 2004 report, explaining that no regulations exist in one-third of the countries and that enforcement is weak in many others. It also cautioned that corruption has been pervasive in the former communist countries set this weekend to join the  EU, which lacks a comprehensive anti-corruption strategy. Similar warnings have been made by the American Bar Association, which recently prepared a judicial reform index and surveyed institutional shortcomings in 15 struggling Central European and Eurasian nations. According to the Center for Public Integrity's survey -- which Lewis called ""a work in progress"" that he wants to expand to 25 additional nations next year -- particular shortcomings exist in mechanisms to ensure that elections are free and fair, a key test of democracy. Turkey, for example, now trying to clear a series of hurdles so it can eventually join the  EU, lacks laws providing for public audits of political party finances and public access to reports about campaign financing and candidate assets. Turkey's head of state, and those in 13 other countries in the survey, cannot be prosecuted for corruption. Turkey also scored its ""weak"" ranking because journalists there have been harmed or imprisoned for investigating corruption, a circumstance it shared with 16 other nations, and because the ruling party controls two-thirds or more of the parliamentary seats -- a feature shared by five other countries. More-developed countries were not above reproach, however. Australia, Germany, India, Italy and Japan  were criticized because the top official in each of those countries -- as well as in Namibia and Zimbabwe -- is not legally obligated to disclose publicly all personal assets. Although the United States was rated strong or very strong in nearly every index measure, it was faulted in particular for lacking a national ombudsman -- along with four others of the 25 nations surveyed -- and for ineffective protections of government whistle-blowers. Lewis also sharply criticized the climate in Washington in which former officials and relatives of top officials in the Bush and Clinton administrations have profited from their access to decision makers. ""It's not Indonesia, Nigeria or Russia that boasts such an unabashed, mercenary culture in which influence peddlers so shamelessly cash in . . . but the United States,"" Lewis said. Private gain from public life, he noted, is both common and legal here."14-Feb-06,UNITED STATES (98%); AFGHANISTAN (96%); EGYPT (93%); KENYA (92%); BOLIVIA (79%); MIDDLE EAST (79%); COLOMBIA (79%); AFRICA (79%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%),"KABUL, Afghanistan  --  A bomb killed four U.S. troops traveling in an armored vehicle Monday in volatile Uruzgan province, the deadliest loss for the U.S. military in Afghanistan in four months. Five Afghan members of a U.S.-backed militia also were killed in a firefight in the southern province of Helmand, officials said. The U.S. troops were patrolling with Afghan soldiers along a valley road in the Dihrawud district when they were attacked, said Lt. Mike Cody, a U.S. military spokesman. Shortly after the blast, gunmen opened fire with small arms and rocket-propelled grenades. Troops fought back and called in attack helicopters and fighter planes, a military statement said. The bombing raised the death toll of U.S. personnel in the Afghan war to 214 since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion. *  CAIRO  --  A decree by President Hosni Mubarak that effectively postpones local elections by extending the terms of thousands of political allies for two years drew an angry response from the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest opposition  group. The terms of local council members were scheduled to expire Tuesday, and by law, elections were to be scheduled within 60 days. But Mubarak issued a decree extending the terms to six years. The councils are considered crucial institutions of centralized state control in Egypt. The measure still needs approval by the lower house, where Mubarak's National Democratic Party holds a solid majority. *  NAIROBI  --  Two government ministers resigned after they were linked to corruption scandals that have shaken Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki's government and angered foreign donors to the East African nation. George Saitoti, the education minister, served as finance minister during the billion-dollar scandal in which public funds were stolen in a bogus gold and diamond export scheme. Kiraitu Murungi, the energy minister, has featured prominently in another scandal and has been accused of pressuring a former anti-corruption chief. *  LA PAZ, Bolivia  --  President Evo Morales called on the Bush administration to deport former president Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada to face charges related to bloody protests that preceded his resignation in 2003. Morales made the appeal during a Mass for more than 30 protesters and police officers killed in unrest in La Paz during February 2003.

When Mobutu died in 1997, having been ousted after more than 30 years in power, many assumed that there was a fortune to be recovered. But little was found in Western bank accounts linked to him. ""I just don't think there was very much left,"" said Richard Dowden, head of Britain's Royal African Society. ""He had to pay off a lot of people. I think his family robbed him rotten. So there wasn't a great heap of wealth to be found."" After Mwai Kibaki won the presidency in 2002 on an anti-corruption platform, his aides estimated that as much as $4 billion in government assets had been stolen and spirited abroad under his predecessor, Daniel arap Moi. Kroll Associates, an international security and investigations firm, was brought in to trace the funds. Kroll and the government report that some money was found, but won't say more, and efforts to bring it home have stalled. Kibaki may be finding it politically difficult to proceed against Moi, who remains a powerful figure with an involvement in peace efforts in neighboring Sudan. Also, Kibaki has problems with allegations of corruption within his own government. Not only is ousted President Charles Taylor accused of looting the Liberian treasury during his 1997-2003 tenure, but businesses linked to him are believed to still be funneling cash stolen from state coffers to the former warlord in exile in Nigeria. Little has been done about it under a transitional government, itself accused of corruption, that is to hand power over to an elected government this year. According to U.N. investigators, the ""modus operandi followed by the top functionaries of the [transitional] government in siphoning off government revenues for various licit or illicit purposes appears to be the same as that used by the Taylor regime."" The government says military dictator Sani Abacha stole more than $2.2 billion from the oil-rich nation from 1993, when he seized power, until his death in 1998. Using diplomacy and the courts, Nigeria has been pushing with some success for the return of Abacha's looted funds from Austria, Britain, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Switzerland and elsewhere. Former president Frederick Chiluba is charged in Zambian courts with 169 counts of corruption, abuse of power and theft totaling $43 million, and 65 counts of state theft totaling about $3.5 million.

Chiluba, Zambia's first democratically elected president, led the southern African country from 1991 until 2002. --  Associated Press"20-Aug-08,ZAMBIA (98%); ZIMBABWE (94%); AFRICA (94%); EGYPT (93%); FRANCE (92%); UNITED STATES (79%),"Levy Mwanawasa, 59, the president of Zambia, whose criticism of the political and economic crisis of neighboring Zimbabwe helped break the traditional silence of African leaders toward one of their own, died Aug. 19 at a hospital in Paris after a stroke. Mr. Mwanawasa suffered a stroke June 29 at an African Union summit in Egypt. He was flown to Paris for treatment July 1. He had a reputation for integrity and fought corruption in his country but never managed to lift the Zambian people out of crushing poverty. Mr. Mwanawasa was Zambia's third president since independence from Britain in 1964 and was not bound by the liberation movement ties of older African leaders. He was the first among them to criticize autocratic Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, who had long been revered as an African independence hero. Mr. Mwanawasa's death leaves a power vacuum in Zambia, one of the world's biggest copper producers. Under the constitution, elections should be held within 90 days. Levy Patrick Mwanawasa was born Sept. 3, 1948, in Mufulira in what was then Northern Rhodesia. He graduated from the University of Zambia and practiced law before entering government service. After a stint as solicitor general in 1986, he soon became a key figure in the push for multiparty democracy. When Frederick Chiluba defeated Zambia's first president, Kenneth Kaunda, in Zambia's first multiparty elections in 1991, Mr. Mwanawasa was appointed vice president. He then quit, complaining of corruption. Even so, Chiluba chose Mr. Mwanawasa to be his successor. Mr. Mwanawasa won the presidency in 2001 in an election marred by allegations of fraud and was reelected in 2006 with 43 percent of the vote in an election that was generally regarded as fair. As he sought to establish his legitimacy in his first term, Mr. Mwanawasa seized on anti-corruption and economic changes and targeted Chiluba, who was found guilty in a London court of stealing $46 million from state coffers during his 10-year rule. Mr. Mwanawasa won praise from the business community and middle class Zambians as well as many Western donors and investors for his free market policies. He tamed inflation and, after years of economic stagnation, presided over a period of growth helped by a boom in global copper prices. Mr. Mwanawasa's economic austerity and market-opening policies drew support from the United States, the World Bank and lending institutions, which agreed in 2005 to cancel nearly all of Zambia's $7.2 billion foreign debt. Critics accused Mr. Mwanawasa of turning a blind eye to the plight of the poor in a country where less than 20 percent of the population has formal employment and the majority lives below the poverty line. Opponents also said Mr. Mwanawasa pandered to the whims of Western donors. Mr. Mwanawasa countered that it was thanks to the forgiveness of foreign debt that he was able to increase spending on education and health. Populist rival Michael Sata and other critics also said he was too subservient to China, which poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Zambia's copper sector. Mr. Mwanawasa accused the West of failing to follow through on promises of increased aid and trade. Africa ""is in the hands of Europe"" but needs China's economic aid, Mr. Mwanawasa told an audience of U.S. students last year. ""You people in the West redeem yourself before you begin attacking China,"" he said."29-Jul-02,ZAMBIA (99%),"Levy Mwanawasa, Zambia's new president, has big plans for his time in office, and no one is finding that harder to swallow than the man who put him there, his predecessor, Frederick Chiluba. After 10 years in office and an aborted effort to stay on beyond the constitutional limit, Mr. Chiluba chose Mr. Mwanawasa to be their party's candidate last year, apparently confident that his chosen successor would safeguard the darkest secrets of a government that, by many accounts, stole with little fear and even less shame. Following recent disclosures about questionable state payments and allegations of other corruption, no one -- and certainly not Mr. Chiluba -- thinks secrets are safe anymore. With the new president pushing Parliament to lift Mr. Chiluba's immunity from prosecution, the coming months could land Mr. Chiluba in court and perhaps even in prison. With his crackdown, Mr. Mwanawasa has managed to dodge some of the questions about his own election, winning applause from people who had questioned the legitimacy of his victory and from skeptics who had predicted that he would be Mr. Chiluba's puppet. Zambia is among the world's most corrupt countries, according to Transparency International, an advocacy group that tracks corruption worldwide. As the link between corruption and poverty grows clearer, citizens appear to be insisting on greater accountability. ""Our people have woken up to the fact that it is their responsibility to improve their lot,"" said Mutembo Nchito, a 33-year-old lawyer who has emerged as a champion of cleaner government. ""I think it's really re-ignited a sense of patriotism. We're ashamed of the way the country was plundered, but we're really proud of the way we're handling it."" Even the initial snipes about the mental fitness of Mr. Mwanawasa, who was being called ""The Cabbage"" on account of his deliberate speaking style, have subsided as the nation has warmed to his hard-charging agenda. But he is also rousing anger among powerful people, who contend that he is setting up his own downfall. Cryptic talk of a plot to unseat him or even assassinate him is popping up, most of it from the state news outlets that he controls. ""I am not targeting anybody,"" he said in an interview at State House, the presidential residence and office. ""I am not witch hunting. This is not a war by one individual. This is not a war by Levy Mwanawasa. The people of Zambia have said no."" Yet, Mr. Mwanawasa's campaign against corruption is very much playing out as a duel between the two men, and so far Mr. Mwanawasa is scoring all the points. In the most remarkable turn so far, Mr. Chiluba's spymaster, Xavier Chungu, was arrested in June and charged with using an intelligence agency bank account in London to funnel secret payments that reached people ranging from Mr. Chiluba's children to Zambia's ambassador to the United States, Atan Shansonga, who was summoned back to Lusaka, the capital, and arrested. The bank account was brought to light in June by Mr. Nchito, who is defending two local journalists and two legislators against charges that they defamed the president last year when they called Mr. Chiluba a thief. Details of the many transactions, which were among records released by Mr. Mwanawasa's government after Mr. Nchito's petition, are still emerging. Some payments could turn out to be aboveboard, but the fallout already suggests otherwise. The country's chief justice, suspected of receiving $168,000, has stepped down. So has the foreign minister, Katele Kalumba, who was Mr. Chiluba's finance minister and was suspected of receiving several thousand dollars from the account. Mr. Kalumba disappeared and was rumored to have killed himself. With crowds of demonstrators urging members on, Parliament took up President Mwanawasa's call to lift Mr. Chiluba's immunity. Mr. Chiluba's lawyers quickly brought an appeal before the High Court, and Parliament's vote was stayed. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for today. Each day brings another twist. Perhaps hoping to balance tough talk with magnanimity, Mr. Mwanawasa raised the possibility of pardoning Mr. Chiluba -- if he returns the money he is said to have stolen. Mr. Chiluba, a trade union leader who helped found the Movement for Multiparty Democracy, came to power in 1991, ending 27 years of authoritarian, largely one-party rule under the independence hero, Kenneth Kaunda. Mr. Mwanawasa, another founder of the party, was vice president until 1994, when he quit, saying he was disgusted with his party's unabashed corruption. Plucked back into politics from the private law practice to which he had retreated, he seemed a shrewd, if unlikely, choice to be the party's candidate in the elections last December. Party leaders reasoned that his long absence from government would would spare him the taint of corruption, while his long association with the party would ensure loyalty. ""It was a mistake, it seems,"" Mr. Chiluba said in an interview at his home here in Lusaka when asked about his decision to nominate Mr. Mwanawasa. ""I am disappointed. I had a lot of faith in my brother Levy Mwanawasa, and he has let me down greatly, I must say."" A lay minister, Mr. Chiluba said that he was not guilty of any criminal wrongdoing as president and that the questions in recent months could have been resolved quietly. Mr. Chiluba said: ""I think decency would have demanded that the president comes to me and says, 'What have you done, my brother? Can you explain?' If I fail, indeed, he is the head of state and he can say then, 'I don't brook this nonsense.' ""But none of this has ever happened,"" he continued. ""I'm wading from one accusation to another, from one indictment to another, and it's becoming a little hard to bear."" Mr. Mwanawasa is unmoved by his predecessor's complaints. ""Now he feels betrayed by the fact that we have revealed what appears to be plunder?"" Mr. Mwanawasa said. ""I don't feel I betrayed him. I would have betrayed the people of Zambia if I did not disclose this."" Whatever the scheme, the plundering of places like Zambia ultimately deprives poor people of the most basic human needs, like nutritious food, while enriching a tiny elite. Years of watching such coteries act with impunity have imbued even the poor with a warped sense of entitlement, said Bradford Malumbe, the chief of operations for the country's anti-corruption commission. Stealing something as ordinary as a fuse from a traffic light is condoned by the community, he said. ""We are working very hard with civil society to get the message across that what you see out there belongs to you not as an individual but as a society,"" he said. Nothing will do that more effectively, said Mr. Nchito, the lawyer, than a successful prosecution of Mr. Chiluba. ""That will burn the rule of law onto the consciences of our people, and no one will be able to reverse it."""29-Sep-06,ZAMBIA (99%); CHINA (79%); AFRICA (79%),"Zambian officials began tallying ballots early Friday after a huge turnout in close elections fought on a debate over President Levy Mwanawasa's economic policies. International donors had praised his actions, but the opposition denounced them for failing to lift millions out of poverty. Mwanawasa urged voters to back his record of strict financial discipline and zero tolerance of corruption, policies that have earned Zambia relief from debts and commendation from the International Monetary Fund and other donors. His populist challenger, Michael Sata, accused the incumbent of ""selling out"" Zambia to donors and foreign firms, particularly from China, who are interested in the country's huge copper reserves. Different opinion polls have tipped both Mwanawasa and Sata to win, meaning Thursday's vote could be the closest in the southern Africa country since it won independence from Britain in 1964. Analysts said the count would be watched closely by voters, who are divided over the competing visions of Zambia's future advanced by the two main candidates. Frequent and at times obvious voter fraud has marred previous elections. Election officials said the vote this year was nearly flawless, except for a few instances, criticized by Sata's Patriotic Front, in which voters were erroneously omitted from registers. A third candidate in the presidential race, Hakainde Hichilema of the United Democratic Alliance, is expected to come in third, despite an endorsement by liberation hero and former president Kenneth Kaunda as the ""best man to lead Zambia."" After the 2001 election, the opposition petitioned the Supreme Court to nullify Mwanawasa's victory, saying the vote was rigged, but the court dismissed the accusations. Zambia's electoral commission introduced measures to try to ensure free and fair elections this time, including satellite technology to transmit poll results and the use of transparent ballot boxes. It is unclear when the winner will be declared. Under a new electoral law, the news media are forbidden to project a winner based on partial results, although poll watchers expect the final count by Saturday or Sunday. Mwanawasa, a burly lawyer who made an early mark with an anti-corruption drive targeting former president Frederick Chiluba, has sought to highlight an economic record that, in addition to winning debt relief, has cut poverty and pushed economic growth above 5 percent. He has repeatedly called the election a referendum on Zambia's economic future. Sata has won support by promising workers a bigger stake in state enterprises, major tax cuts and a 51 percent cap on foreign mine ownership. His rallies have been packed with supporters who say the Mwanawasa team has failed to bring the benefits of Zambia's economic revitalization to the estimated two-thirds of Zambia's 11.5 million people who still live on less than $1 a day."16-Aug-01,ZIMBABWE (94%); UNITED STATES (92%); KENYA (92%); AFRICA (92%); AUSTRIA (79%),"HARARE, Zimbabwe -- The editor of Zimbabwe's only independent daily newspaper and three colleagues were in police custody yesterday over a report alleging police vehicles were used during a wave of looting of white-owned farms. Geoff Nyarota, editor-in-chief of the Daily News, assistant editor Bill Saidi, news editor John Gabanga and reporter Sam Sam Munyavi were all being held at Harare's central police station, the newspaper's spokesman said. ""It looks like they are all spending the night in custody,"" the spokesman said. Daily News executive Thomas Deve said he suspected the men were being held over a report in his newspaper that alleged the police had been involved in looting white-owned farms. Chief police spokesman, assistant commissioner Wayne Bvudzijena, confirmed Nyarota's arrest, but said he was not aware his three colleagues had also been detained. ""He has been charged under section 50 (2a) of LOMA which forbids the publication of false news likely to cause alarm and despondency,"" Bvudzijena said. Reuters NAIROBI -- The International Monetary Fund announced that lending to Kenya would remain suspended after the country's parliament rejected a key piece of anti-corruption legislation. Business leaders said the decision would rip a $ 300 million hole in the government's budget and plunge the country's economy deeper into crisis. The government says it still hopes to persuade the IMF to restore lending, but diplomats said the government instead needed to persuade opposition parties to pass some kind of modified legislation. Opposition leader Mwai Kibaki, of the Democratic Party, said the government proposal was full of discrepancies and fell short of what would be necessary to fight corruption. Parliament voted 130 to 82 Tuesday for a bill paving the way for the establishment of a body to fight official corruption, a key piece of legislation demanded by the IMF as a condition for releasing suspended loans. However, the support fell short of the 145 votes needed to pass the constitutional amendment. ReutersEUROPE VIENNA -- A day after her release from an Italian prison, an American jailed for three weeks after the Group of Eight summit in Genoa said she would fight for the release of other ""political prisoners."" Susanna Thomas, 21, a Quaker from New Jersey, said her time in prison had brought her closer to others arrested in connection with the protests at the summit last month. ""We shared a toothbrush. We shared soap, chocolate, cigarettes and all the little things that make life pleasurable. And most of all,"" she said, ""we shared support."" Thomas was among 20 people ordered released by a Genoa court Tuesday. The group was made up of 15 Austrians, three Americans, a Slovak and a Swede. Several others are still detained, including at least 10 Germans accused of being members of the anarchist Black Bloc group. Arriving at Vienna's airport from Milan, Thomas promised to do all she could to support the other detainees. She still faces charges that could lead to a 15-year prison sentence. ""The story is still going on,"" she said. ""All the Genoese political prisoners need help and support and solidarity."" Associated Press LOURDES, France -- A Spanish man packed his car with explosives and set it on fire after ramming through the entrance to the Lourdes Sanctuary, where 40,000 people were attending Mass, officials said. No one was injured in the attack, which occurred during a ceremony to mark the Assumption Day holiday. After the man, described as a local resident in his seventies, bashed through one of the portals of the Lourdes complex in southwest France, he stopped his car and set it on fire. LCI television quoted a witness as saying that the man doused his car seats with gasoline and lit the fire while still inside the vehicle. Security guards immediately pulled the man from the car and extinguished the flames, state prosecutor Yves Saint-Macary said. The car was loaded with Molotov cocktails, gas canisters, bags of nails, a loaded rifle and hundreds of cartridges, officials said. The man told authorities he was trying to commit suicide and had no religious or political motive, Saint-Macary said. Associated Press ""Everything has gotten worse because [President Mohammad] Khatami has granted more social freedoms."" -- A police officer in Tehran, speaking after a mass public flogging in the capital -- Page A1 Compiled by Virginia Hamill"24-Apr-99,,"When President Nelson Mandela's government appointed Ramesh Vassen this year to be South Africa's consul general to India, critics said the attorney, who was disbarred for stealing money from client trust funds, wasn't fit for a diplomatic post. Mandela and his top officials defended their choice but eventually conceded that Vassen's appointment had to be withdrawn. When Mandela's ruling African National Congress listed party official Patrick Matosa as a candidate for the June 2 parliamentary election, critics said that a man convicted of threatening a police officer with a gun wasn't fit to run for office. The ANC initially stood by Matosa, but his candidacy ultimately also was withdrawn. In a nation in the throes of what Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, the ANC's leader, recently called a ""threatening state of moral degradation,"" the Vassen and Matosa cases illustrate what some see as governmental ambivalence toward ethical laxness and corruption, sometimes reflecting a conflict between party loyalty and party discipline within the ANC. With South Africa's second democratic election only six weeks away, corruption, along with violent crime, has become one of the hottest campaign issues. Opposition parties accuse Mandela's ANC of being soft on corruption, especially when it comes to figures with anti-apartheid ""struggle credentials,"" such as Vassen, who once worked in the civil rights law firm of the current justice minister. Because South Africa's political field remains racially divided, these criticisms -- which come mostly from white opposition groups -- strike some blacks here as racist attacks on black rule itself. The ANC counters that corruption is a product of the moral decay inherited from the years of apartheid, the repressive racial separation policy that underpinned white-minority rule. But the problem is so alarming that Mandela and Mbeki, who is virtually certain to become president after the June ballot, have in recent weeks repeatedly decried corruption. Barreling into the sacrosanct status of party faithful who once were beyond public reproach, Mandela recently lambasted fellow ""freedom fighters"" for becoming corrupt bureaucrats. ""We came into government with the intention of cleaning the civil service of corruption,"" Mandela said. ""But our freedom fighters, some of them very top activists, when they got the opportunity, also stole taxpayers' money."" George Bizos, widely regarded to be South Africa's most dogged and famed human rights lawyer and a loyalist of the anti-apartheid struggle, says that the techniques of that struggle have lent themselves to crime and corruption following the demise of white rule and the entry of former anti-apartheid guerrillas into government. ""The deviousness needed to fight the apartheid system is deep rooted and now is being used"" by foes of apartheid who have turned dirty, he said. ""Our society's values require upliftment."" Examples of corruption abound: Provincial government officials accused of stealing public funds, particularly in Mpumalanga Province east of Johannesburg. An investigation of the nation's top immigration official, Albert Mokoena, director general of Home Affairs, for allegedly giving false IDs to foreign players on a basketball team he allegedly managed from his government office. Some 10,000 police -- out of a force of about 120,000 -- arrested by the end of 1997 in connection with crimes such as theft and armed robbery, according to a Safety and Security Ministry report to Parliament. Sophisticated white-collar syndicates, presumably with the aid of civil servants, have defrauded pension funds and housing subsidy programs of millions of dollars intended to help the elderly and poor. Such housing and pension scams are the bulk of the 90,000 cases, valued at about $ 1.5 billion, that are being probed by the Heath Special Investigations Unit, an anti-corruption body established in 1996. The unit is charged with investigating corruption and recovering government funds. Revelations of corruption have surged since 1994, when South Africa's first all-races election brought an end to apartheid. But officials here, including anti-corruption investigators, say corruption was systemically rife, even at the highest levels of government, during the decades of white-minority rule. It was kept undercover and was generally sanctioned, they say, by the nation's white rulers. Indeed, the current government's leading anti-corruption investigator, Justice Willem Heath, said recently that he is probing cases from the apartheid era that include two or three former cabinet ministers. In the days of apartheid, said Heath, ""the corruption was very high up."" He could not say the same for the current government. In addition to Heath's presidentially mandated special investigative unit, corruption is investigated by the National Public Protector, the auditor general, the public service commission, police anti-corruption units and an independent police watchdog group. The ANC says that the existence of these bodies, which the ANC-led government created, shows the seriousness of its commitment to fight corruption. ""Today we are able to talk about corruption because of the transparency the ANC has brought . . . to not only discover corruption but to prevent it from happening,"" chief ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe said of the government's anti-corruption drive. But Heath, who has been fighting the government over unit funding, questions the commitment to fighting corruption. ""They are completely unwise not to invest more in the unit,"" Heath said. ""So yes, maybe one could draw the inference that they are not as serious as they claim to be."" Opposition leaders such as Tony Leon of the small, predominantly white Democratic Party, question why the ANC closed ranks around its controversial health minister, Nkosazana Zuma, instead of holding her accountable for the disappearance of roughly $ 2 million from a special anti-AIDS project she had sanctioned. Last week, Heath dropped his investigation of Zuma because she was not the Health Ministry's accounting officer and therefore could not be held responsible for the missing money, Heath unit officials said. This political war over ethics and accountability is likely to heat up as the vote approaches, for high on the ANC election list -- and not to be removed, Mbeki says -- is one of the most popular yet controversial figures of all: Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. The president's former wife, who kept the Mandela name in the public eye while Nelson Mandela served 27 years of political imprisonment, has solid credentials as a key foe of apartheid. She also has a criminal record: her 1991 conviction for the kidnapping of a young anti-apartheid activist who was found murdered. Mbeki says nation is in ""threatening state of moral degradation."" Mandela has lambasted ""freedom fighters"" for becoming corrupt."31-Jul-98,,"The head of Kenya's new anti-corruption authority has been suspended from office after a disagreement with the Finance Minister in a case that underscores just how difficult it is to root out graft here. President Daniel arap Moi suspended the official, John Harun Mwau, on Wednesday, just four days after Mr. Mwau had filed charges against four high-ranking Treasury Department officials, accusing them of a scheme to evade $3.9 million in import duties on wheat and sugar. The President's actions came after the Finance Minister, Simeon Nyachae, in a spirited defense of his accused subordinates, attacked Mr. Mwau in public, accusing him of starting a witch hunt. He defended the officials, who are accused of corrupt business dealings, maintaining that not only did they act within the law, but with the full approval of the Cabinet. Played out on the front pages of newspapers here, the disagreement has undermined the credibility of Mr. Moi's efforts to stamp out corruption, once again putting Kenya's shaky relations with international lenders in jeopardy. ""This is not helpful,"" said one diplomat, insisting on anonymity. ""This is an unfortunate development, distracting from the central issues this country faces. This is all a distraction, a sideshow."" When the International Monetary Fund suspended aid to Kenya last year, one of its principal complaints was that the Government had done little or nothing to rein in rampant official corruption. In recent years, corrupt schemes have seeped into almost every level of government here, from bribes that traffic officers solicit from motorists to elaborate land grabs and import-duty scams involving cabinet members, diplomats say. In response to pressure from the I.M.F., Mr. Moi set up the Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority last December and put Mr. Mwau, a former police officer and an opposition gadfly, in charge. But Mr. Mwau's decision to prosecute the four treasury officials as his first high-profile case has raised questions about his sincerity and the viability of his authority, diplomats and financial officials said. Before the charges were leveled, the four accused officials were seen as part of a progressive, reform-minded wing of the governing party, a group led by Mr. Nyachae that stands firmly behind efforts to stamp out corruption. While diplomats and officials at international lending institutions said they could not say whether the charges were true, they did say they came as a surprise. ""We have a feeling that these people who were to be arrested were doing their jobs and we have no reason to believe they were corrupt,"" one banking official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Whether or not the charges are true, several diplomats said the public contretemps was not likely to persuade the I.M.F. and World Bank to resume aid to shore up Kenya's shattered economy, which is reeling from a steep drop in tourism. On the streets of the capital, meanwhile, speculation has grown that Mr. Mwau purposely took aim at pro-reform officials first, instead of other officials suspected of corruption in order to take the wind out of the pro-reform movement's sails. A cartoon in Wednesday's Daily Nation newspaper showed Mr. Mwau and Mr. Nyachae as puppets, their strings being pulled by hands recognizable as the President's. A statement from the President's office said Mr. Moi would appoint a tribunal to ""inquire into the proper performance"" of the corruption authority. The statement said Mr. Mwau would be suspended until the tribunal had finished its inquiry. For his part, Mr. Mwau has fiercely defended the charges against the four officials and has said he will resign if they are not proved true in court. It is highly unlikely the case will ever be heard, however, since the Attorney General has dropped the charges. The accused officials are Joseph Kinyua, Njeru Kirira, John Msafari and Samuel Chebii. At the same time, Mr. Nyachae has accused Mr. Mwau of pressing the charges only to divert attention from the fact that he himself is under investigation by the Kenya Revenue Authority for evading duty on the import of automobile tires. Mr. Mwau denies any wrongdoing."15-Mar-00,WESTERN AFRICA (93%); AFRICA (93%); NIGERIA (93%); ZIMBABWE (79%);,"In West Africa, where pop stars sometimes take on the role of the traditional storyteller-historians called griots, several band leaders have achieved mythic status. But none has been as commanding as Fela Kuti, who died in 1997, reportedly of AIDS. The singer and saxophonist was a prolific musician who recorded more than 50 albums in the style he dubbed Afro-beat, but he also was an outspoken critic of Nigeria's succession of corrupt military and civilian governments. Among his best-known songs are such broadsides as ""Zombie,"" ""Shuffering and Shmiling"" and ""Coffin for Head of State."" These and 10 other songs are included on ""The Best Best of Fela Kuti"" (MCA), a new two-CD set that presages the reissue of much of the musician's back catalogue. Fela's compositions are sprawling vamps that incorporate American jazz and funk as well as such traditional African devices as call-and-response vocals. Most of the tracks on ""Best Best"" are edited or partial versions, yet still run an average of more than 12 minutes each. Like such West African peers as King Sunny Ade--or Washington's own go-go bands--Fela dealt in expansive grooves rather than concise songs, presiding over an improvisational big-band flow into which he could interject a sax or keyboard solo, a communal chant or an anti-corruption screed. Fela's battle with Nigeria's government was not merely a matter of words: He suffered imprisonment, beatings and exile. If he didn't live to see his populist and pan-African ideals widely adopted, his music survives to continue the crusade. And unlike such equally outraged African musicians as Zimbabwe's Thomas Mapfumo, Fela sang mostly in English, so his message can also be widely understood. Listening to Fela's full output would surely be as exhausting as deciphering his mystical politics is exasperating, but distilled to these two discs his music is both fierce and approachable.  (To hear a free Sound Bite from this album, call Post-Haste at 202-334-9000 and press 8153.)  Femi Kuti: 'Shoki Shoki'  Fela's son Femi continues the family franchise with ""Shoki Shoki"" (MCA), an album whose style is both more disciplined and less distinctive than his father's. The younger Kuti, who performs March 22 at the 9:30 club, has modernized Afro-beat with electronics and crossover appeal. Most of the album's 12 songs (which include three remixes) run only about six minutes long, and while Femi hasn't tailored his sound for dance clubs, he does pay more attention to the underlying polyrhythms than Fela usually did. Like his father, Femi plays sax and sings in pidgin English, which he uses to deliver such generalized inspirational messages as ""Truth Don Die"" and ""Blackman Know Yourself."" But he also addresses such nonpolitical topics as the pleasure of sex (""Beng Beng Beng,"" which the female chorus pronounces ""bang bang bang"") and everyday uncertainty (""What Will Tomorrow Bring?,"" which features a horn-section riff straight out of early-'70s funk). Generally less caustic than Fela, Femi doesn't name names or hurl taunts. Still, when he denounces ""politicians and soldiers"" and makes an explicit reference to ""Zombie,"" it's clear that Femi is continuing Fela's campaign.

Since Nigeria's military handed power to elected officials in May 1999, the Senate has twice impeached its president, who is the country's third-ranking official, and has forced out other leaders of the legislature's upper house for alleged corruption. The speaker of the lower chamber resigned last year amid an uproar because he had faked a university degree. More than a year after President Olusegun Obasanjo and other civilian politicians took over Africa's most populous country, the repeated scandals underscore Nigeria's struggle to find its political bearings after living under military rule for 30 of its 40 years as an independent country. Official corruption remains a critical problem as Nigeria struggles to repair its economy. But for the first time in recent memory, some top government officials are being held publicly accountable for malfeasance in office. Nigeria's political stabilization is critical to American interests, U.S. officials say, a point reflected by President Clinton's scheduled visit here later this month to cement dramatically improved relations. This country is a major supplier of oil to the United States and a key partner in trying to end the war for diamonds and power in nearby Sierra Leone. Nigeria's legislature, the National Assembly, is structured much like the U.S. Congress, with a Senate and a House of Representatives. Within two months of taking office last year, the lower house ousted its speaker, Salisu Buhari, after he admitted embellishing his resume with a fictitious MBA degree from the University of Toronto. In November, the Senate impeached its president, Evan Enwerem, amid allegations that he had concealed a criminal conviction. Enwerem was replaced by Chuba Okadigbo, who in Nigeria's previous civilian government had been an aide to President Shehu Shagari. Okadigbo proved a stubborn Senate president, insisting on the legislature's independence from Obasanjo and holding up passage of the 2000 budget until last month. But last month, a Senate committee found that Okadigbo, his deputy and the Senate majority leader had colluded with others to award contracts worth millions of dollars to firms linked to them or their relatives. Okadigbo also overspent by 50 percent the $ 245,000 he was allotted to furnish his official residence and awarded himself a Christmas bonus of $ 220,000, the committee's report said. Even Nigerians who have been toughened to the profligacy of their officials were startled to learn that Okadigbo was keeping a fleet of 32 luxury cars. Joseph Wayas, the Senate president under Nigeria's previous civilian government, noted to the Nigerian media that he had gotten by with only four official cars. Amid a public uproar, Okadigbo's deputy and the majority leader resigned. But Okadigbo refused to join them, calling the investigation a political vendetta. He was impeached and removed on Aug. 8. In some ways, analysts say, the legislative scandals have advanced Obasanjo's anti-corruption campaign. ""We all now know that under [former military dictator Gen. Sani] Abacha, bullion vans routinely went to the Central Bank to load millions of dollars in cash and deposit [it] at his residence, and nobody asked questions,"" said Lagos banker Yetunde Johnson. ""But now questions are being asked and people are having to give account,"" he said. ""It's no doubt a victory for democracy."" Still, while the National Assembly has been heavily occupied with its scandals, Nigeria continues to wrestle with economic and political crises. The first legislation introduced by Obasanjo sought to use oil revenues to bring roads, electricity and other development to the long-neglected Niger Delta region. Youths of impoverished delta tribes have formed guerrilla groups that attack oil pumping stations or rival villages, and the danger of a civil upheaval among the oil fields is seen by many as Nigeria's greatest security risk. Although Obasanjo and legislative leaders have said the delta crisis is a top priority, they have been unable to agree on a bill. Last week, the Senate chose Pius Anyim, 39, an outspoken opponent of corruption, as its new president. ""The combination of President Obasanjo and Anyim represents for now a potential for sobriety, honesty and integrity in the conduct of public affairs,"" wrote Anietie Usen, a columnist for the independent newspaper Thisday. Anyim is seen as an ally of Obasanjo in a quiet tussle for influence within the governing People's Democratic Party. The party's machinery--its top fundraisers and organizers--is dominated by a loose network of political bosses, businessmen and former military officers once close to Maj. Gen. Shehu Yar'Adua, a former Obasanjo deputy who died in prison in 1997. As military rule ended following the death of Abacha, this faction helped found the party, and only later was Obasanjo persuaded to run as its candidate. Some foreign diplomats have voiced concern at the legislative paralysis in a period when Nigeria wrestles with ethnic and religious conflicts, and the violence in the Niger River delta. But the legislature's turmoil ""is not a sign of instability,"" said Oladapo Fafowora, a retired Nigerian diplomat. ""We have just returned to full-fledged democracy after 15 years during which all structures of democracy were either destroyed or suspended. In democracy if there's a long break with the past, you'll have to start all over again."""18-Oct-99,NIGERIA (94%); NIGER (79%);,"When former Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo was inaugurated as president of Nigeria in late May, he took over a once-prosperous nation that had been reduced to misery by a series of larcenous military regimes. In the late 1970's, Mr. Obasanjo was himself Nigeria's military ruler, although the first to turn over power to a civilian. In 1995, Gen. Sani Abacha, the country's most ruthless leader, jailed him for three years. But General Obasanjo remained close to the military and, bankrolled by some of Nigeria's most nefarious officers, won elections this year. There was reason for skepticism about his intentions. Nevertheless, President Obasanjo -- who is to receive Secretary of State Madeleine Albright later this week -- has won over many of his critics by distancing himself from his former military allies, taking important steps to combat corruption and restoring political freedoms. He is now beginning economic reforms. With one important exception -- the troubles of the oil-producing Delta region -- President Obasanjo has awakened hopes that Nigeria's slide can be halted or reversed. Some of Mr. Obasanjo's actions are not only symbolically important, but can also reduce the chance of yet another military coup. On June 10 he fired 93 high-ranking officers, including all who recently occupied political posts. Mr. Obasanjo also canceled all contracts awarded by the military government in 1999, which saw billions of dollars in sweetheart deals. He has established three commissions to investigate corruption. Nigeria is freer than it has been in years. A bustling civil society is back in operation and unions are regaining influence. A new commission that will hold hearings and collect reports on serious human rights abuses has only limited powers, but it is led by respected activists. Mr. Obasanjo's efforts to revive the economy have been blessed by a sharp rise in the price of what is virtually the country's only product, oil. He has chosen a capable economic team, which has begun to reverse Nigeria's pariah status with international lenders. His most visible and popular achievement to date has been to end an absurd gasoline shortage that kept drivers waiting in line, sometimes overnight, for expensive gas. The shortage was caused by corrupt manipulation of oil supplies. Fighting corruption is Mr. Obasanjo's most important and difficult challenge.  State treasuries are so looted that many cannot pay $20-a-month teachers' salaries. Mr. Obasanjo has proposed an anti-corruption bill, and measures to cut middlemen out of state transactions. But Mr. Obasanjo, sadly, has shown little interest in one necessary measure to combat corruption and several other problems -- a new relationship between Nigeria's states and its central government, which controls most of the country's revenue. The issue is seen most dramatically in the Niger Delta. Oil money goes to the central government, where it disappears. The oil-producing Delta gets virtually nothing back to alleviate desperate poverty or clean up environmental destruction. This has radicalized many in the Delta. Youth gangs have kidnapped oil workers and sabotaged production, which has cost Nigeria billions of dollars. Security forces have responded with hundreds of killings. In early June, Mr. Obasanjo met with Delta community leaders. But his conduct and his proposals show that he sees the region mainly as a security problem. Without more local say over oil money and how it is spent, the Delta could explode. Mr. Obasanjo's greatest contribution to Nigeria's stability may eventually be his willingness to reduce his own powers. http://www.nytimes.com"26-Nov-99,UNITED STATES (96%); NIGERIA (94%); AFRICA (92%); NIGER (79%);,"Nigeria is Africa's most populous country, and potentially one of its most prosperous. But for decades, a deeply rooted culture of corruption has undermined Nigeria's economy, impoverished its people and tarnished its international reputation. It has also helped make Nigeria one of the world's leading centers of drug smuggling, including much of the narcotics that reach the United States. Now, under a new democratic government, there are encouraging signs of change. If President Olusegun Obasanjo continues his aggressive campaign against bribery, kickbacks and consumer scams, Washington and other Western governments should reward his efforts by rescheduling some of the debts Nigeria incurred under the corrupt military regimes of the past. Mr. Obasanjo came to office with a deserved reputation as a reformer. In the 1970's, he headed the only military government in Nigeria's history to freely hand power to an elected successor. Later, under the harsh 1990's dictatorship of Gen. Sani Abacha, he spent three years in prison for opposing government repression. But few expected a serious attack on corruption or a serious investigation into the abuses of his military predecessors. Mr. Obasanjo's earlier government was known for diverting oil revenues and demanding payments for licenses and contracts, and his election campaign this year had been financed by Nigeria's military establishment. But since taking office six months ago, President Obasanjo has removed hundreds of corrupt military officers and government officials and brought legal claims against their business cronies that could permit the recovery of billions of stolen dollars. Corruption still plays too big a role in Nigerian political life, and Mr. Obasanjo has shown a disturbing tendency to wink at illicit conduct by his closest political allies. But the change in Nigeria's ethical climate is pronounced. Nigeria's oil and mineral wealth should disqualify it from outright debt relief. But when Mr. Obasanjo visited Washington last month, President Clinton endorsed stretching out payments on some of Nigeria's $30 billion international debt as further reforms unfold. The administration should wait until Mr. Obasanjo's strong anti-corruption legislation overcomes parliamentary resistance. Washington should also demand compliance with international human rights standards, especially in the oil-producing Niger Delta, where the repressive policies of previous military governments are still in force. But once these conditions are met, America should help make Nigeria a showcase for the proposition that an honest, democratic government can bring a demonstrably better life to ordinary people. http://www.nytimes.com"20-Dec-08,UNITED STATES (96%); BURKINA FASO (79%); GUATEMALA (79%),"Lorne Craner, the president of the International Republican Institute; Bill Frist, a former Republican leader of the Senate; Kenneth Hackett, the president of Catholic Relief Services; and Alan Patricof, a founder of a venture capital firm, are appointees to the Millennium Challenge Corporation's board.  AS Barack Obama works to reinvigorate America's standing in the world, foreign aid will be one of his most precise tools of statecraft. Ever since the Marshall Plan helped rebuild Europe after World War II, aid has been instrumental in winning hearts and minds and catalyzing global economic growth that has contributed to America's prosperity. But not all foreign aid is the same. Hard lessons learned over the past five decades have taught us that good governance, accountability, local ownership and long-term engagement are the keys to success. In January, the new administration will inherit the five-year-old Millennium Challenge Corporation, which was created by Congress to ensure that foreign assistance operates according to these principles. He would do well to adopt it as a core development tool. Aid works best in countries whose governments are capable and committed. Before directing any American aid to a country, the corporation measures its performance on 17 indicators of democratic government, anti-corruption efforts, investments in health and education (particularly for girls) and economic freedom. Only those countries that perform strongly are allowed to compete for a five-year compact that makes them eligible to receive American aid for programs intended to reduce poverty and stimulate economic growth. By building its program around independent measures of policy performance, the corporation has been able to catalyze reform in poor countries -- sometimes before any aid money is spent. Burkina Faso, one of the  poorest countries in the world, has committed to improving girls' primary education. And in Guatemala, which does not yet qualify for a compact, the president has made improvement on the indicators a national priority and appointed the vice president to lead the effort. Aid programs are sustainable only when they are designed and carried out by the country that needs them. The Millennium Challenge Corporation insists on playing a robust consulting role to ensure that any program the United States helps finance has a good rate of return and a clear effect on reducing poverty, and that the highest standards of accounting are followed. But it also requires that poor countries assume primary responsibility for their own development to ensure that our assistance truly helps the poor help themselves. The corporation's board includes key members of the president's cabinet -- the secretaries of state and Treasury, the United States trade representative and the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development -- along with a bipartisan group of four citizens appointed by the president on the advice of Congress. The cabinet members make sure the program operates according to the president's foreign policy, while the four private members see that it remains faithful to the principles that Congress laid down for it. The long-term engagement with the United States that is required for any country to earn a Millennium Challenge Corporation compact provides a platform for the kind of robust diplomacy that President-elect Obama has embraced. As he seeks to adapt American foreign assistance to a transformed world, one decisive step he can take is to signal his strong support of the corporation's approach to global development."9-Apr-10,NAMIBIA (99%); CHINA (93%),"WINDHOEK, Namibia -- Three suspects in a $12.8 million kickback scheme involving the sale of Chinese-made X-ray scanners last year to the Namibian government pleaded not guilty on Thursday to 13 charges of corruption, money laundering and fraud. The case has drawn international attention because the Chinese company involved, Nuctech, was led at the time by Hu Haifeng, the son of President Hu Jintao. Investigators here said he was not being treated as a suspect at the moment, but they complained of being stonewalled by the Chinese authorities. After news broke of the arrests last year, Chinese censors also blocked all Internet references to Namibia inside China, an indication of the political sensitivity of the case in Beijing, analysts said. All three suspects -- including a senior Namibian civil servant and a Chinese executive for the company -- face charges under the Namibian Immigration Control Act, the Prevention of Organized Crime Act and the Anti-Corruption Act, in connection with a $12.8 million ''commission.'' The payment was secretly agreed to between a private company that the suspects had established and Nuctech, five days after Nuctech had officially concluded a $55 million deal with the Namibian Finance Ministry to provide the scanners. Under the terms of this ''agency agreement,'' the suspects were to push for a higher price for the scanners and use their political access to ''expedite prompt payments,'' according to a copy of this contract submitted to the court. Namibian prosecutors charge that the $12.8 million commission was the same amount demanded by Nuctech from the Namibian Finance Ministry as a manufacturing deposit. After receiving what investigators said was an initial $4.2 million portion of this commission, the three went on a huge spending spree, buying houses, cars and farms, the prosecutors said. The state seized these assets and froze all bank accounts last year. But in late January, a Namibian judge ruled that the state did not have a case on the seizures and ordered the assets to be returned. The state is appealing this ruling now. The three suspects were granted bail in separate proceedings, with the amount for Nuctech's  representative, Yang Fan, set at $130,000. But in spite of having more than $2 million in a local bank account, Mr. Yang has not been able to gain access to it to pay his bail and has remained in jail, he told the court Thursday. Also as a result, he has not been able to hire a lawyer to represent him, he told the court magistrate, who halted proceedings. The suspects must wait until May 7 to hear whether the Namibian prosecutor general will refer the case to Namibia's High Court for trial, the magistrate ruled. The 13 charges read out Thursday were still preliminary charges."6-May-10,NIGERIA (97%); SENEGAL (92%); SAUDI ARABIA (79%); NIGER (79%),"DAKAR, Senegal -- President Umaru Yar'Adua of Nigeria, whose chronic ill health sapped initial promises of reform and led to a constitutional crisis in his country, died Wednesday night, the information minister said in a brief interview. He was 58. ''He has died,'' said the minister, Dora Akunyili, adding that Mr. Yar'Adua had expired at the presidential villa in the capital, Abuja. Mr. Yar'Adua suffered from kidney and heart ailments, and his health had been one of the country's top concerns for weeks, ever since he departed at the end of November for emergency treatment in Saudi Arabia. He did not transfer power when he left. In the following months, Nigeria, already racked by low-level civil wars over oil and religion, was left in limbo. There was no center of authority, and a peace plan Mr. Yar'Adua had enacted for the violence-plagued oil-producing south seemed in danger of falling apart. Mr. Yar'Adua, shielded by his wife and other supporters, did not appear in public and made no statements, apart from a few faltering words to the BBC in January from his hospital room. As public anger over the power vacuum grew amid fears that the country would revert to military dictatorship, the National Assembly reluctantly acted in February, handing power over to Mr. Yar'Adua's vice president, Goodluck Jonathan. Ever since, Mr. Jonathan has called himself merely the ''acting president,'' proceeding on the assumption -- which few people among the country's political class or media shared -- that Mr. Yar'Adua would one day return to office. He was taken back to Nigeria in the middle of the night on Feb. 24, but was seen by no one outside his immediate circle. There were public demands that Mr. Jonathan meet with him, but there was no indication that he had done so. Increasingly discounted as a political force, by virtue of his presence Mr. Yar'Adua placed an additional question mark over the presidency of Mr. Jonathan, a native of the rival southern half of Nigeria. That has now been removed. Mr. Yar'Adua, a soft-spoken former governor from the country's Muslim north, won a deeply flawed election in 2007 that included credible reports of fraud and ballot stuffing. Still, the election was seen as an advance in a vast, populous and resource-rich country that less than a decade before had been enduring a brutal military dictatorship. Trained as a chemist, he was born Aug. 16, 1951, into a political family. His father became a minister soon after Nigeria gained independence, and his brother held a ranking post in a military government of the late 1970s. Nigerians, keenly aware that their impoverished and wealth-stratified nation has not realized its potential, had hopes that Mr. Yar'Adua might help it do so. He promised to tackle a culture pervaded by corruption, improve the shaky to nonexistent electricity supply, and end the violence that crippled production of oil, Nigeria's principal source of cash. But his truncated presidency fell short on all three points. The leading anti-corruption official in the country was chased from office after vigorously pursuing high-level graft, including among Mr. Yar'Adua's supporters. The lights continue to flicker on and off throughout the country. And the Niger Delta, although less incendiary than in some previous years, still experiences periodic flare-ups. The shadowy rebel groups in that region purport to fight under a banner that nonetheless remains as glaringly real as when Mr. Yar'Adua took office three years ago: Nigeria's vast inequities in wealth."20-Jun-11,ZAMBIA (99%); SOUTHERN AFRICA (79%); MALAWI (79%); AFRICA (79%),"Frederick Chiluba, the first democratically elected president of Zambia, a man whose image as a defender of civil liberties was later tarnished by his efforts to suppress political opposition and accusations that he used millions of dollars of public money on his wardrobe and other extravagances, died Saturday in Lusaka. He was 68. He suffered from chronic heart problems. His death was confirmed by his spokesman, Emmanuel Mwamba. The son of a copper miner, Frederick Jacob Titus Chiluba -- a diminutive man barely five feet tall -- was Zambia's president from 1991 to 2002. His ascent to high office was for a time considered a heartening success story in a poor, landlocked nation of 13 million people in southern Africa. He left secondary school before graduation and was working as a low-paid bookkeeper when he joined a union, rising through the ranks in the labor movement until he became chairman of the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions in 1974. The nation had won independence 10 years earlier. Kenneth Kaunda, a hero of the liberation struggle, was Zambia's first president, but his single-party, socialist rule was an economic failure. In 1981, he jailed Mr. Chiluba and other labor leaders without charges after they instigated wildcat strikes. A judge ruled the detentions unconstitutional, and after three months behind bars, Mr. Chiluba emerged emboldened. He would eventually forge a coalition of unions, civic groups and churches to form the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy to challenge Mr. Kaunda at the polls. A personable man with oratorical gifts, Mr. Chiluba was a born-again Christian and often used biblical references in his speeches. He was also a passionate advocate of democracy, and in 1991, when Mr. Kaunda finally agreed to multiparty elections, Mr. Chiluba won the presidency with nearly 76 percent of the vote. In his first address, the new president said, ''The Zambia we inherit is destitute -- ravaged by the excesses, ineptitude and straight corruption of a party and a people who have been in power for too long.'' He lamented that after 27 years of Mr. Kaunda's leadership, ''Now the coffers are empty. The people are poor. The misery endless.'' Mr. Chiluba was indeed inheriting a fiscal mess, and though he steered the country toward a free-market economy, the government remained dependent on foreign aid, and the average Zambian was still mired in poverty. The remarkable transformation seemed to come in Mr. Chiluba rather than in his nation. The Chiluba government was notably corrupt, and the president appeared to regard himself as irreplaceable. In 1996, he barred Mr. Kaunda from running against him, changing the Constitution to preclude candidates born outside Zambia. He even attempted to deport Mr. Kaunda to Malawi. In 2001, Mr. Chiluba again toyed with rewriting the law, this time to allow himself a third term in office. But by then, the president's reputation as a reformer had been replaced by one far less flattering. Civic groups and churches rose up in opposition and thwarted the plan. Instead, Mr. Chiluba anointed his former vice president, Levy Mwanawasa, as his successor, presuming that incriminating secrets would remain concealed. But the new president, narrowly elected, instead decided to shine a light on public corruption. Mr. Chiluba would soon be charged with stealing $500,000 of public funds. He additionally was sued in a civil action by Zambia's attorney general, who decided to try the case in Great Britain, where the former president was said to have laundered millions of dollars he plundered while in office. Testimony in the civil matter was astonishing. Zambia's anti-corruption task force had seized much of Mr. Chiluba's wardrobe, including 349 shirts, 206 jackets and suits, and 72 pairs of size-6 shoes, many of them personalized with his initials affixed in brass. The heels added two inches to his stature. Mr. Chiluba spent more than $500,000 in a single clothing store, Boutique Basile, in Geneva. Its owner testified that garments were sometimes paid for with suitcases full of cash. ''The president,'' unlike the emperor, ''needs to be clothed,'' Justice Peter Smith of the High Court said in 2007, ruling that Mr. Chiluba owed Zambia $57 million. Much of the money, Justice Smith said, had been funneled into an intelligence agency bank account in London ''set up primarily to steal government money.'' Justice Smith said the former president ''should be ashamed,'' pointing out that while he was accumulating handmade shoes and silk pajamas, many Zambians ''could not afford more than one meal a day.'' Mr. Chiluba, who never appeared in court, refused to recognize Justice Smith's verdict, calling it ''racist'' and ''obscene.'' The criminal proceedings, held in Lusaka, were less sensational. They dragged on for six years, frequently delayed by Mr. Chiluba's ill health. The former president denied stealing any public funds, saying instead that he had received millions in gifts from ''corporate interests'' and ''well-wishers'' whose identities he would not reveal because of ''the golden rule of anonymity.'' In 2009, a magistrate acquitted Mr. Chiluba, ruling that however large his fortune, the money could not be traced to missing government funds. Celebrating the news, the former president said, ''The devil has tried to put the stigma of a thief on me, but God has dealt with the devil.'' By then, Levy Mwanawasa had died in office. His successor, Rupiah Banda, has since disbanded much of the nation's anticorruption apparatus. Mr. Banda has referred to Mr. Chiluba as a ''damn good president'' and credited him with bringing political freedoms to the country. Mr. Chiluba will be accorded a state funeral, the government announced. He is survived by his wife, Regina, and, according to local reports, 10 children."12-Oct-07,SOUTH AFRICA (94%); AFRICA (79%),"A politically powerful industrialist is gunned down in an ambush linked to a reputed  mobster. Investigators link the mobster to the national police commissioner. Prosecutors obtain a warrant for the commissioner's arrest. Then suddenly, the warrant vanishes -- and the chief prosecutor who secured it is removed from his job. Not even South Africa's political insiders know for sure where this mystery leads, and the man who does know, President Thabo Mbeki, is not saying anything. But political and legal experts alike increasingly suspect the worst: that a brutal two-year battle for power in the  governing African National Congress is spreading from party corridors into the government itself. With a convention to choose the party's next leader barely two months away, a bitter rivalry between the two major camps -- that of Mr. Mbeki, who aspires to continue as the party president, and that of the populist politician Jacob Zuma, who wants to replace him -- has become even more caustic. Mr. Mbeki fired Mr. Zuma as deputy president in 2005 after investigators tied Mr. Zuma to a bribery scandal involving a multibillion-dollar military contract. Mr. Zuma has regularly accused prosecutors, and by implication Mr. Mbeki, of manipulating the justice system for political ends. Many analysts dismissed that as sour grapes. Now the same issue has surfaced in the case of the national police commissioner, Jackie Selebi, a senior figure in the party who is broadly asserted to be an Mbeki supporter. And some analysts are no longer so certain. Marinus Wiechers, for one, says that that he fears that the temptation to use the government's powers for political ends has become irresistible. ''The party-state is a thing that threatens all democracies, especially young democracies,'' Mr. Wiechers, a constitutional law expert and former university vice chancellor, said recently. ''If you break down the separation of powers, you're certainly heading for a constitutional crisis.'' Were that true, it would -- like Nixon's  use of the Internal Revenue Service against his critics -- be widely considered an affront to the nation's democratic values. In what has become known as the Selebi affair, however, neither Mr. Mbeki nor his aides have explained why they intervened in a legal proceeding to prevent Mr. Selebi's arrest. Rather, Mr. Mbeki has named a prominent member of the African National Congress to investigate the matter and broadly suggested that the full findings may not be made public for reasons of national security. Political commentators have already noted, acidly, that Nixon used that excuse to cover up his own transgressions. The basics of the Selebi affair are about the only things that remain clear. In September 2005, hit men pumped seven shots into a Johannesburg mining magnate, Brent Kebble. Investigators implicated a reputed  organized-crime figure, Glenn Agliotti, known as the Landlord, who later said the Kebble murder was an ''assisted suicide'' that he helped arrange. Mr. Agliotti's cellphone records showed that he called Mr. Selebi -- South Africa's police commissioner and the president of Interpol, the international police organization -- from near the scene of the murder shortly after it occurred. In the ensuing outcry, Mr. Selebi denied any wrongdoing, called Mr. Agliotti a close friend and said he never discussed police business or criminal activity with him. Mr. Agliotti said he was only being a good citizen and reporting a crime to the police when he called Mr. Selebi. Mr. Mbeki declined to suspend or investigate Mr. Selebi, telling critics to have faith in his judgment. But investigators for South Africa's elite anti-corruption squad, the Scorpions, found evidence of crimes involving the two men. Last month, Vusi Pikoli, the head of the Scorpions and the nation's chief prosecutor, presented the secret evidence to two Johannesburg judges and secured warrants to arrest Mr. Selebi and to search his home and office. The warrants, however, were never executed. In late September, Mr. Mbeki's justice minister apparently learned of the warrants, demanded that Mr. Pikoli resign and then suspended him when he refused, according to local news reports. Mr. Pikoli's replacement then visited the two judges, asking them to rescind the warrants. The arrest warrant was canceled, the search warrant remains intact, Mr. Selebi remains in command -- and to date, nobody has explained why. Mr. Mbeki has asked Mr. Pikoli's successor to review the evidence against Mr. Selebi and to recommend whether any action is needed. Mr. Pikoli, meanwhile, is under investigation by Mr. Mbeki's appointee, apparently for prosecutorial excesses. While the public version of the charges is not specific, it suggests that Mr. Pikoli is accused of giving immunity too liberally to organized-crime figures in return for incriminating evidence against Mr. Selebi, and of securing his arrest warrant without informing higher-ups. In South Africa's Parliament, the African National Congress, which controls 7 in 10 seats, has closed ranks, and calls by the opposition to investigate the affair have been rebuffed. News of the arrest warrant and its reversal, aired in newspapers and only grudgingly confirmed by the government in the past month, has set off outrage in the news media and among South Africa's minuscule political opposition. After nearly two weeks of daily headlines, Mr. Mbeki's only public comment on the issue has been to joke that the president does not issue arrest warrants. ''It's a big mess,'' said one veteran criminologist, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared losing work with the government, ''and it's a mess that comes from the uncertainty about the boundaries that separate the state from the ruling party.'' Bereft of facts, South Africa has been rife with speculation. The most damning version accuses Mr. Mbeki of protecting Mr. Selebi, a member of his party's executive committee with some influence in the debate over the party's next leader. Another version draws on the longstanding rivalry between the Scorpions and South Africa's national police, the nation's leading law enforcement organizations, and suggests that Mr. Pikoli overreached in an attempt to dispatch a rival. The Scorpions also broke the bribery case that led to Mr. Zuma's dismissal in 2005. Although his friend and financial adviser has been sent to prison in that case, Mr. Zuma so far has evaded prosecution -- and some suggest that Mr. Mbeki has sidelined Mr. Pikoli because he has moved too slowly to eliminate Mr. Zuma as a political rival. Or it could mean nothing, with due process occurring behind the scenes. Mr. Mbeki is a famously distant politician, renowned not just for ignoring public opinion but for shunning it. ''The failure to answer questions and inform the country of what he's doing is not a new feature of Mbeki's style,'' Steven Friedman, a longtime political analyst, noted drily."25-Sep-11,RWANDA (95%); SINGAPORE (92%); KENYA (92%); CENTRAL AFRICA (79%); AFRICA (79%),"Nyamata, Rwanda The white altar cloth in the Catholic Church of Nyamata is still stained brown with blood. Shoes, dresses and trousers worn by families massacred within the sanctuary lie, gently decaying, atop the pews. The hole in the church's iron door, blown open years ago by a grenade, will never be repaired: The Catholic Church of Nyamata is now a museum, a memorial to the thousands of people murdered here in April 1994, at the peak of the Rwandan genocide. When I stepped outside, I could hear a congregation singing: A new church has been built next door. Around the corner, I could hear children in their classrooms, hard at work on a Saturday. Along the road to Kigali, the Rwandan capital, trees have been planted. Development economists and aid mavens know very well the story of Rwanda's remarkable recovery. But the country's achievements may be less appreciated by the wider public. Seventeen years after more than 800,000 ethnic Tutsis were murdered in just a few months by their Hutu neighbors, Rwanda has 7 percent economic growth, near-universal health insurance and fierce anti-corruption laws. Kigali is remarkably clean and relatively safe. Some 40 percent of Rwandans own cellphones. National identity cards now identify people as ""Rwandan,"" not Hutu or Tutsi. It is the ambition of Paul Kagame, the Rwandan president - and former leader of the Tutsi exile army that conquered the country in the genocide's wake - to go much further. While visiting one Rwandan government agency I accidentally picked up some notes left by previous visitors, an advisory team from Singapore. Their presence was no accident: Lee Kwan Yew's benign authoritarianism is widely admired here, and some of his methods are in evident use. The former Singaporean leader infamously banned chewing gum in his country. Kagame has banned plastic bags - they aren't biodegradeable - and requires all Rwandans to wear shoes. But there are limits to copying the Singaporean model. Rwanda is landlocked, and it has difficult neighbors. A truck leaving Kigali takes at least four days to reach Mombasa, Kenya, the nearest port. Worse, the driver will pay, according to one survey, $864 in bribes at 36 roadblocks along the way. Much though it might like to be an export-led African tiger, Rwanda's geography prevents it. Rwanda's government has, as a result, set an ambitious goal: to become a ""services hub"" for central Africa or, in the local jargon, a ""knowledge- and information-based economy."" Toward that end, the government has begun laying fiber-optic cable across the country and has been vigorously courting foreign investors (Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim was in town just a few days ago). And here is where Rwanda's ambitious economic plans run into Rwanda's political reality. Though some opposition is legal, and though people in the capital speak openly about the country's deficits, the Rwandan press is weak and journalists are downtrodden. Some have been murdered. Others are in jail. Many have fled the country. All are considered fair game for bullying, and not only by the government. One journalist showed me an e-mail he received from a local nongovernmental organization that wanted him to publish a photograph. Its conclusion: ""Please post the picture online and if not, please give a clear explanation as to why not."" Until now, Kagame and his ministers have argued - citing the track record in Singapore and elsewhere - that control of the press, of politics and of speech was essential to the preservation of what still seems, to them, a fragile peace. Their fear of destructive criticism - and of losing power - is not excusable, but it is understandable, given their history: The current political elite is largely composed of members of the Tutsi minority who with Kagame fought their way back into the country in 1994, where they found piles of corpses. Supporters of the old regime live across the border in Congo, or so current leaders believe, and still write angry denunciations of the regime from their exile. And yet no government that prohibits the free circulation of information can create a ""knowledge- and information-based economy."" Even leaving aside the ethics, nobody will invest in a ""services hub"" where people fear speaking the truth. Some of Rwanda's leaders at the very highest levels know this and are pushing broad media reforms; I was in Rwanda with the Legatum Institute - a London-based nonpartisan group devoted to good governance, for which I am director of political studies - to learn about these changes. The Rwandans still have a long way to go, as they themselves will acknowledge. But they may have no choice, for there is a larger point here: In recent years, it has become fashionable in some circles to speak of a ""Beijing consensus,"" a road to growth and development that eschews democracy, scorns Western models and favors authoritarianism, benign or otherwise. A few years back, Rwandans leapt onto this bandwagon too. It got them a clean capital, fast growth and low crime - quite far, in other words. But how much farther? The development economists and aid mavens often speak of the ""bottlenecks"" in infrastructure and energy supply that might block growth in Rwanda. Maybe it's time to add ""lack of free speech"" to that list. applebaumletters@washpost.com"17-Aug-97,KENYA (94%); RWANDA (92%); AFRICA (92%); EASTERN AFRICA (92%); UGANDA (92%);,"The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have provided the summer's most welcome change in the way global finance and business operate. But they have also furnished a jarring reminder to prognosticators that things often fail to work out as we think they will. Kenya is at the center of the international bankers' reforms and the failure of past conventional wisdom. Because of corruption, the two world financial institutions have suspended loans to the government of President Daniel arap Moi, who also faces bloody street protests because of his dictatorial rule. When I lived in Kenya in the early 1970s as Africa correspondent for The Post, there were two firm bits of conventional wisdom about that beautiful East African nation: One was that Moi, a politician of limited intellectual ability who hailed from a minor tribe, was a transitional figure who could not survive long as president. The other was that Kenya's resources, international visibility and dynamic society should enable it to overcome its crippling internal ethnic rivalries and become a great African success story. Neither prediction looks very good today. Moi's unshakable hold on power for nearly 20 years has been accompanied by a steady decline in the nation's stability and prosperity. There can be little doubt now that the two factors are intimately connected. When the Central Intelligence Agency commissioned an independent study on why states fail two years ago, political leadership was listed among the leading indicators of national catastrophe. East Africa today provides confirmation of this in several ways. Uganda and Rwanda, after enduring terrible bloodlettings and economic collapse, have emerged from their times of trouble with secure and assertive political leadership. Rwanda's Paul Kagame and Uganda's Yoweri Museveni have, through their support of change in the Congo, sketched the basis for a promising regional alliance that is likely to gain increasing international support. But they still must overcome the other failed-state criteria the CIA-commissioned study lists: infant mortality, population pressure, closed trade borders, weather, ethnic tensions and more. The study recommended an official ""watch list"" of countries that get in the trouble zone. It is unclear if the agency ever established such an indelicate document for policymakers. A Michelin guide to political turmoil could be a bestseller in international circles. But you can understand the agency's reluctance to acknowledge that it is watching for three-star hellholes to come. Imagine the hurt feelings, and expulsions of spooks, that would follow. Would a country like Kenya make such a list today, despite all the advantages it still has over its neighbors? It is a measure of Kenya's intrinsic strength that it has been going downhill every year for two decades in the eyes of many of its citizens, former residents and visitors, but still works as a center of global tourism and as a regional headquarters for business and international organizations. The pragmatism of founding President Jomo Kenyatta and his advisers -- as well as the munificence of Kenya's glorious wildlife reserves, tea and coffee plantations and seaside resorts -- gave Moi a substantial heritage to squander after he came to power in 1978, on Kenyatta's death. Moi had been chosen as Kenyatta's vice president in part to secure a tribal alliance between Kenyatta's Kikuyu and Moi's Kalinjin followers. The Kikuyu politicians who squabbled over succeeding Kenyatta let Moi come to power on the theory that they could easily manipulate him and toss him aside later. That was a disastrous miscalculation. Moi divided and conquered the Kikuyu, shuffling the army and internal security commands into the hands of his tribesmen and allies. He let corruption flourish to buy off his more pliable opponents, using harsher measures against others. But Moi's misrule is now being challenged in the streets of Nairobi, where his police killed five demonstrators in one recent protest, and in the board rooms of the world's leading international financial institutions. In a departure from past practice, the International Monetary Fund this month suspended a $ 220 million loan to Kenya because Moi failed to create a strong anti-corruption authority demanded by the fund. The World Bank has also recently delayed smaller loans to Kenya because of concern about corruption. This apparently coordinated squeeze on official corruption in Kenya -- and presumably elsewhere in the future -- is a welcome innovation. International organizations have for too long averted their eyes and treated corruption as an internal matter beyond their reach. Flagrant corruption that is tolerated or assisted by national governments is not a matter of sovereignty. It is a cancer on the international system as well as on the national state. It should be identified and fought far more quickly than it has been in the past. The predicament becomes even more acute as Russia and China pursue their efforts to integrate into the global economy. The forms of corruption that plague these two ex-centrally planned economies differ, but raise many of the same problems present in Kenya. Corruption on a national scale is a proper target for international condemnation and action as well as intelligence scrutiny."4-Mar-95,,"Winnie Mandela, the estranged wife of South Africa's President, Nelson Mandela, is charged by police with defrauding four impoverished black communities. The continuing descent of this former heroine of the anti-apartheid struggle is an individual tragedy, not a metaphor for the larger story of the African National Congress in power. Still, corruption is a serious problem in South Africa, from bribe-seeking police and customs agents to the kickbacks sought from businesses by rainmakers trading off old A.N.C. connections. So far there is no evidence directly implicating top officials of the new Government, a favorable contrast with the last years of white rule. But relative virtue is not good enough. If fickle international investors are to be attracted to South Africa, and poverty is to be mitigated and adequate public services provided, the Mandela Government and the A.N.C. leadership must not tolerate official corruption. Past sacrifices made on behalf of the anti-apartheid movement cannot be a license to loot the public trust. The latest moves against Mrs. Mandela, like the forced withdrawal from a diplomatic posting of another renowned anti-apartheid leader, Allan Boesak, help convey that message. But a more systematic campaign is needed before a culture of corruption becomes entrenched. American businesses that left South Africa to protest apartheid and now seek to return can help by resisting the offers of those who would throw deals their way. President Mandela's moral authority makes his participation essential to an anti-corruption campaign. He has already charted the rhetorical foundations for such an effort with two stern and powerful speeches. As with many other areas of day-to-day management, much depends not just on Mr. Mandela but also on his second in command and potential successor, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki. Mr. Mbeki has not yet publicly given the corruption issue the high priority it deserves. An alarmed South African public, including honest A.N.C. militants and members of the local business community, are urging him to take up this important fight. The Clinton Administration and American businesses should join their voices to this righteous South African chorus."20-May-94,SOUTH AFRICA (96%); NIGERIA (95%); AFRICA (94%); UNITED STATES (92%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%);,"Civil rights leader Beko Ransome-Kuti chain-smoked and downed Coca-Cola and coffee while staring at his computer through bloodshot eyes.

""On behalf of the toiling masses of the Nigerian people,"" the letter began, ""the Campaign for Democracy wishes to congratulate you on your election as president of a free and democratic South Africa."" The letter went on, ""We also want to use this opportunity to tell you not to give any form of recognition to the illegitimate military government in Nigeria and its delegates to your inauguration ceremony."" Nigeria, sub-Saharan Africa's most powerful and populous country with 88 million people, was one of the continent's most vitriolic opponents of apartheid, the South African white minority's system of racial separation. But rather than inspiring Nigerians, the success of South Africa's democratic elections in putting the black majority in power merely highlighted the failures of Nigeria's own democracy movement. ""How South Africa Shamed Nigeria,"" read a headline in Concord, an opposition newspaper. Its accompanying article said: ""A cringing, squeamish pygmy. That is what Nigeria, the much vaunted giant of Africa, has been reduced to by the successful elections held in South Africa."" Last June, Nigeria's ruler, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, annulled the results of the country's first free and fair presidential elections. The dictator, who had seized power in a coup eight years earlier, appointed an interim civilian administration when he stepped down in August, and 10 weeks later another general, Sani Abacha, grabbed power, becoming Nigeria's seventh military ruler since the country won independence from Britain 34 years ago. Abacha has banned political parties, dissolved parliament, replaced civilians with soldiers to administer Nigeria's 30 states and has launched what he calls a ""War Against Indiscipline and Corruption."" His opponents say the anti-corruption drive is the general's response to criticism by Western lenders, particularly the United States, of Nigeria's endemic graft and slow democratic reform. Washington cut aid after cancellation of the elections and imposed sanctions that barred the military from receiving U.S. visas. As Babangida had done, Abacha pledges a return to civilian rule, although he has given no date for his departure. Instead, he has called for a four-month-long constitutional conference to begin June 27. Some groups have threatened to boycott the talks, and supporters of Moshood Abiola, the winning presidential candidate in June's elections, are urging him to form a rival government. However, Abiola has so far failed to live up to the expectations of his supporters. They rallied behind him to become Nigeria's first southern president after decades of domination by the northern elite living off the government's revenues drawn from oil in the south. Abiola fled the country for two months after the elections, citing fear for his life. His failure to ride the swell of discontent has critically weakened what was formerly a hearty opposition in a country traditionally divided along ethnic and religious lines. Another huge blow was Abacha's winning over of some of the military's most vocal opponents. He recruited the Campaign for Democracy's attorney and one of its leaders, Olu Onagoruwa, as justice minister. ""They always find willing civilians who invite them [the military to take power] and who work with them and who encourage them,"" said Foreign Minister Baba Gana Kingibe. Kingibe, in fact, was Abiola's running mate, though members of the two men's party repudiated Kingibe when he joined Abacha's cabinet. ""When he [Abiola] fled and left us to our sorts, certainly many pressures and questions were being addressed to me: What do we do next? What is the nature of the resistance we are going to make now and with what objective? And of course with each passing day, that objective of upholding the mandate of [the elections] became more and more elusive,"" Kingibe said. The public's reaction to Nigeria's mercurial politicians was apparent the day after Ransome-Kuti wrote his letter to Mandela. On that day, the Campaign for Democracy had called for its first nationwide stay-at-home protest against Abacha's regime. By noon, however, the streets of Lagos were their normal gridlock of commuters. Demonstrations last July drew tens of thousands into the streets and left scores dead. Opposition leaders blamed the protest's failure on poor organization, but people did not seem to have their hearts in it. ""People are saying, 'Well, if people came out and voted and the result is annulled and the same people for whom you have voted are also in government, so what hope is there for the ordinary Nigerian?' "" said Paul Ejime, deputy Lagos bureau chief of the Pan African News Agency. ""So, they don't want to be pushed around anymore. I think that is the general feeling of cynicism and inaction and ineptitude and apathy that is sweeping the country."" But that might not last for long if Abacha continues his economic policy. Whereas intellectual, politically inspired protests lack teeth these days, such issues as fuel shortages and loss of jobs might send people into the streets. Nigeria is sub-Saharan Africa's largest oil producer, but it has imported fuel in recent years because of shortages caused by cross-border smuggling by the military and the deteriorating condition of the nation's refineries. They currently operate at one-third capacity. Fuel lines snake longer than a mile in Abuja as tanker trucks coming from the south make lucrative detours to the borders. At 3 cents a gallon, Nigeria has some of the cheapest gasoline in the world. Roughly 30 percent of the nation's fuel is lost through smuggling, diplomats say. The oil sector accounts for 90 percent of the government's revenue, so a 20 percent drop in oil prices made matters even worse. Nigeria's non-oil sector has even more severe problems. Manufacturers have been scrounging for hard currency to import raw materials ever since the government eliminated the parallel market this year. Many Nigerians describe Abacha and his government as less than intelligent men. However, Abacha, backed by the northern elite, has managed to stay on through three military governments while the list of forcibly retired generals seems to stretch longer than the nation's gasoline lines. Meanwhile, democracy advocates are waiting for a Mandela to legitimize their struggle. ""We go to parties explaining how inadequate the northern elites are, but no one does anything,"" said political science professor Olufemi Otubanjo. ""They say things will explode, but the fire needs to be stoked. Every Nigerian is waiting for his own miracle. ... We have not begun to struggle yet."""7-Aug-95,,"Giulio Andreotti, the besieged former giant of Italian politics, should hope to do so well in court. Late Friday, in the nearby town of Ferentino, the aging Andreotti took to the stage defending Pope Boniface VIII, a medieval pontiff who was kidnapped by agents of Philip the Fair of France. Philip had sought to put the papacy under his thumb. In the role, Andreotti defended the pope against charges of heresy, performing magic, sodomy and incest. Some other year, this might merely seem a quaint cameo appearance by a venerable and well-read politician. But this peculiar evening's play was filled with theatrical parallels. Andreotti, a seven-time prime minister and a dominant figure in Italian post-Cold War politics, is scheduled to go on trial next month in Palermo, Sicily. He is accused of having ties to the Mafia. In a separate case, Andreotti is under investigation for ordering the assassination of a corrupt, muckraking journalist. The accusations against him are a capstone to Italy's 3 1/2-year ""Clean Hands"" anti-corruption drive. The campaign, spearheaded by public prosecutors in Milan, has brought down an entire political ruling class, including Andreotti's Christian Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, numerous politicians and their business partners. Nothing like the scale of the papal captivity, perhaps, but for the Italian political scene, cataclysmic. So on Friday, several lines recited by Andreotti dripped with irony. ""They tell so many legends,"" he said at one point, waving a kind of scepter. ""The seat of the pope is not so comfortable,"" he said at another point. ""There is no back to it. . . . So the saying, 'As well off as the pope' is not always true."" The crowd applauded. The Palermo trial of Andreotti will have its own drama. Paolo Mieli, the editor of the influential newspaper Corriere della Sera, has called it the trial of the century. Mafia informers testified that Andreotti bestowed the kiss of allegiance on the now jailed crime boss Toto Riina. Others said he ordered the journalist killed because he feared discovery of a major kickback scandal. Clean Hands has a mixed record in nailing major political figures. Former Socialist prime minister Bettino Craxi was sentenced to eight years in prison for taking kickbacks but has taken refuge in Tunisia. Former foreign minister Gianni De Michelis was sentenced to four years for raking off funds from highway projects in northern Italy but is free pending appeal. Last week, Ciriaco De Mita, a former Christian Democratic prime minister, was found not guilty of corruption in relation to millions of dollars spent to rebuild parts of southern Italy following a 1980 earthquake. ""It was the continuation of a political maneuver; it was not a question of justice,"" De Mita said in an interview at his palatial summer home in Nusco, near Naples. De Mita is one of several former Christian Democrats planning a comeback. ""People call and ask my advice; I never left politics, really,"" De Mita said. Andreotti also may take heart from the difficulties confronting prosecutors in Palermo who have tried to convict a former top police official of having Mafia ties. Bruno Contrada recently was released for health reasons after 32 months' captivity. In those 32 months, the lead prosecutor, Gian Carlo Caselli, has been unable to build a compelling case against Contrada. Like the accusations against Andreotti, the charges against Contrada are largely based on the testimony of Mafia turncoats, known here as pentiti. If the case against Contrada cannot stick, some observers believe the charges against Andreotti also will go nowhere. Andreotti, who holds the honorary title of senator for life, is both admired and reviled for his command of the political scene over four decades. After staying out of the public eye for months, he has popped up recently at several public events -- book debuts, the U.S. Embassy's July 4 celebration and Friday at a summer festival at the ancient baths in Ferentino. He was pitted against a neo-fascist politician, Romano Misserville, who took the part of Sciarra Colonna, an Italian nobleman who led the French troops to Boniface. Legend has it that Colonna slapped the pope, who sat waiting, abandoned, on his throne in Anagni. Andreotti conceded only that ""Boniface was tough and his language was not something out of finishing school. . . . But he was sustaining the spiritual over the temporal."" A jury of a journalist and historian acquitted Boniface of wrongdoing."4-Oct-95,UNITED STATES (97%); CANADA (94%); SOUTH AFRICA (92%); ISRAEL (78%); RUSSIAN FEDERATION (68%);,"Judge Lance Ito told the jurors before their deliberations in the O.J. Simpson case that ""the whole world is watching,"" and he seemed to have that right. As it did for most Americans, the Simpson trial and its verdict came to symbolize for foreign onlookers the deep racial divides in the United States, the perils of televising the wheels of justice and the loopy culture of celebrity crime and media excess. Reaction to the verdict ranged from indignation on Canadian talk radio -- ""I think he got away with murder,"" said one caller -- to standing applause among blacks in a cafe in Soweto, South Africa, where CNN glowed on four television sets. ""We're aware that white America is trying to do the black guy down,"" said Manasse Shole, one of the patrons. Most South African blacks had not heard of O.J. Simpson before last year, but for many he became a symbol of racial victimization, as he had for many African Americans. Said Wandile Ndala, owner of the Soweto bar: ""We feel we must also play a role as black people to show the white people that they never, ever know us. . . . We don't say we are going to kill our wives or our girlfriends, but the black man must be free, obviously."" The global reach of America's trial of the century had its limits. In Italy, news of the verdict had to wait in line behind television segments on a new government budget, wrangling among anti-corruption prosecutors, controversy over immigration, and new taxes. A Frenchman interviewed about the case confused the defendant with a member of another Simpson family, the TV cartoon characters. In Moscow, the late-evening news about Simpson on the independent NTV network followed coverage of the situation in Chechnya. The Russian reporter noted that television viewership of the trial had matched that of the Persian Gulf War, and he contended that a ""very rich"" Simpson had been acquitted thanks to a skilled legal team and despite the view of most white Americans that he was guilty. In Israel, only viewers with satellite dishes could hear the verdict instantaneously. The onset of Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year, is coupled with a news blackout that is broken only in rare cases of national emergency. Canadians, who watch the United States from a front-row seat whether they want to or not, became avid followers of the Simpson saga. Live coverage and Canadian analysis on the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.'s all-news channel drove its ratings up by 20 percent. In southwestern Ontario, a power failure left 500 people in the dark about the verdict, and they swamped their local power company's office with complaints as they sought details of the news from Los Angeles. The circus atmosphere engendered by television cameras in the courtroom served as a constant source of comparison to a sensational murder trial in Ontario this year. In that torture-murder of two teenagers, strict publication rules were in effect, cameras were barred from the courtroom, jurors were not sequestered, and a verdict -- a guilty verdict -- was reached in short order. Canadian Justice Minister Allan Rock today pointedly praised the Canadian way of conducting trials. In Britain, London Evening Standard columnist Peter McKay wrote: ""We should not write off America. . . . The legal system that made this case last for over a year was not created by evil people who rejoice in the guilty going free. This imperfect instrument exists to prevent innocent people from going to prison. It will survive an O.J. acquittal."" One far-flung trial watcher was Rosa Lopez of Sensuntepeque, El Salvador, who gained brief notoriety in Los Angeles as a defense witness by offering an alibi, later discredited, for Simpson's whereabouts during the crucial period when the murders were committed. ""Of course it is good,"" Lopez told reporters who gathered outside her family's home. ""If the jury found him innocent, it is because he is innocent."" She plans, she said, to return to the United States in a few days. The verdict came at 2 a.m. Tokyo time, too late for Wednesday morning's regular daily newspapers in Japan, although the Mainichi Shimbun, a national daily newspaper, carried a story discussing how the Simpson case had inflamed racial tensions in the United States. ""O.J. Simpson trial reveals the social sickness,"" the headlines said. Three morning sports newspapers carried the acquittal story with banner headlines and no other news on Page 1. The Sports Hochi newspaper said, ""If he was found guilty, people worried that the L.A. riots of 1992 would happen again."" But the paper noted that the acquittal meant no riots would interrupt the Los Angeles event that most Japanese are more interested in: tonight's playoff game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds. Japanese pitcher Hideo Nomo is a star on the Dodgers, and Japan is intently following the playoff series. The most unusual foreign reaction was the afternoon headline in Panama City's tabloid Critica Libre. ""Simpson Guilty!"" it said. The newspaper's editors apparently misread an accompanying wire service article quoting legal analysts who were confident of a guilty verdict. ""So he's not guilty? Well, I guess there's not much different between the United States and Panama after all,"" said a Panama City taxi driver named Evelio. The blunder reminded him of the years when former military leader Manuel Noriega allegedly executed his political opponents. ""Here in Panama, all of Noriega's hired killers were innocent too,"" he said. Correspondents Tod Robberson in Panama City, Lynne Duke in Johannesburg, David Hoffman in Moscow, Daniel Williams in Rome and Mary Jordan and Kevin Sullivan in Tokyo contributed to this report."2-Jan-98,KENYA (97%);,"With more than half of the constituencies counted in Kenya's chaotic presidential election, the former Vice President, Mwai Kibaki, was putting up a strong fight against President Daniel arap Moi. As the counting of ballots continued at a slow pace, the situation remained explosive. Both Mr. Moi and Mr. Kibaki have laid the groundwork for rejecting the results should they lose, raising fears of violence from their supporters. Both men have accused the Kenya Electoral Commission of rigging the election against them after officials botched the delivery of ballots to many constituencies and had to extend voting. On Wednesday night, Mr. Kibaki, of the Democratic Party, and another opposition candidate, Raila Odinga, of the National Development Party, said they would not accept the results if Mr. Moi won and warned that the country was edging toward civil strife. ""It is clear that this rigging will lead to violence, to disaster,"" Mr. Odinga said. In response, Mr. Moi's aides put out a tough statement this morning warning opposition leaders to accept the results and warning them that security officials would ""deal swiftly and firmly"" with politicians who tried to disturb the peace. Today Mr. Kibaki struck a more conciliatory tone. At a news conference with Mr. Odinga this morning, he appeared unwilling to reject the election results as long as he had a chance of victory. Urging his supporters to be calm, Mr. Kibaki said Mr. Moi was trying to confuse Kenyans by placing all the blame on the Electoral Commission when much of the fault lay with the Government itself. ""Kenyans can no longer be duped,"" he said. He also committed himself to forming a ""government of national unity"" with Mr. Odinga and other opposition leaders, hinting that should he become President he would include other political factions in his cabinet. Mr. Kibaki, who is 66, may have reason for hope. With about 69 percent of Kenya's 210 parliamentary constituencies counted, he was trailing Mr. Moi by only 336,000 votes -- 1,351,000 to 1,686,700, according to unofficial returns broadcast on Kenya Television Network. Mr. Moi, who is 74, is seeking a fifth and final five-year term as President. His opponents say his administration has destroyed this once-prosperous country's infrastructure and economy, ruling with corruption and incompetence. In 1992, he reluctantly bowed to international pressure and scrapped the one-party state he had built in the 1980's, agreeing to hold multiparty elections. He won the 1992 contest with about 37 percent of the vote, mostly because his opponents were splintered along tribal lines. Mr. Kibaki, an economist who served as Mr. Moi's vice president from 1978 to 1988, ran a well-organized campaign with an anti-corruption theme. He accused Mr. Moi and his cronies of stealing tax revenues that should have gone to roads, schools and hospitals. He also promised free primary education to every child. Though Mr. Kibaki's message has won him more support than in the last election, when he placed third with 20 percent of the vote, he faces one big handicap. He is a Kikuyu, a member of Kenya's largest tribe. Most smaller tribes fear the return of a Kikuyu to the presidency. Under Jomo Kenyatta, the country's first president, the Government ignored their regions. Mr. Moi, who comes from the small Kalenjin community, has capitalized on that fear, forging a coalition of smaller tribes from the Rift Valley, the Northeast and the Indian Ocean coast. Indeed, tribalism is at the root of Kenya's current political crisis. Mr. Odinga represents the aspirations of the Luo, Kenya's third largest group, while the candidate now running fourth in the returns, Michael Kijana Wamalwa, comes from the Luhyia, the second largest tribe. If Mr. Kibaki, Mr. Wamalwa and Mr. Odinga had agreed to back a single candidate, they would have easily defeated Mr. Moi. But their supporters are too suspicious of candidates from other tribes to construct a coalition, analysts say. In addition, none of these challengers have strong support outside their tribal regions, while Mr. Moi has won allies from several tribes through Government patronage. The result is a tinderbox. If Mr. Kibaki and Mr. Odinga choose to reject the election results and call on their supporters to take mass action, the country could easily descend into tribal violence, diplomats and political analysts said. Some pro-democracy advocates are even arguing the election should be immediately annulled to avoid violence. A convention should be held to draft a new constitution that gives less power to the president and encourages coalition governments, they said. ""The moment Moi is announced as the winner, you are going to see this country go up in flames,"" Kivutha Kibwana, a pro-democracy lobbyist, said at a news conference today. The violent undercurrent could be seen today in the Railways Club in central Nairobi, where election officials were counting ballots in the presidential race in the Westlands constituency. It was a close race between Mr. Moi and Mr. Kibaki. After tallying the figures four times, Rosemary Moraa, an election official, announced: ""The winner is Mwai Kibaki."" Mr. Moi had gotten 16,651 to Mr. Kibaki's 17,154. Despite having agreed to all the numbers, agents from Mr. Moi's governing party -- the Kenya African National Union -- exploded and set upon agents for Mr. Kibaki. For several minutes, the two groups scuffled. A dozen riot police officers did little to stop the fray, but eventually herded the opposition supporters outside while Mr. Moi's backers remained inside, clustered around their candidate for parliament. In another incident, two people were killed by the police during a protest outside a counting station in Nakuru on Tuesday night."31-Jul-98,UNITED STATES (95%); SERBIA (94%); KOSOVO (93%); ALBANIA (93%); MEXICO (93%); EUROPE (93%); ANGOLA (93%); ASIA (92%); KENYA (92%); CAMBODIA (92%); SERBIA & MONTENEGRO (89%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (79%); JAPAN (79%);,"Sanctions May Not Be Way For U.S. Foreign Policy The White House and Congress have decided that in many cases sanctions are not an effective way to make foreign policy.

His selection reflects the complexities of power in Nigeria today. When the country's current leader, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, took over last June, he promised a transition to civilian rule after 15 years of disaster under general after general. Mr. Abubakar has kept his promise.  But the transition is incomplete. Military officers, who largely bankrolled Mr. Obasanjo's candidacy, will continue to loom over his government. Mr. Obasanjo will have to break with them to have any success in improving life in Africa's most populous nation. General Abubakar took power after the death of Gen. Sani Abacha, one of the most corrupt and certainly the most despotic of Nigeria's recent military rulers. Their thievery and mismanagement turned Nigeria, one of the world's richest nations during the oil boom of the 1970's, into one of the world's poorest. General Abacha snuffed out political life in this once-vibrant country, jailing many of his rivals, including General Obasanjo. In his nine months in power, General Abubakar reversed much of the political crackdown. Most political prisoners are now free. Newspapers publish openly. This election was the first in many years in which the Government did not dictate the number of parties, although General Obasanjo's opponent has complained about fraud in Saturday's voting. But General Abubakar's early promises to bring corrupt or brutal officers to justice have melted away. Some political opponents arrested on trumped up charges are still in jail. General Abacha's decrees muzzling the press are still on the books, and lately some journalists who write sensitive stories have been harassed and their publications confiscated. Police have killed protesters, with the worst repression in the Delta, Nigeria's poorest region despite being the source of its oil wealth. Many Nigerians hope that Mr. Obasanjo's government will end the military's political role, but this is unlikely. Mr. Obasanjo, who was president from 1976 to 1979, is the only military ruler to leave office voluntarily. Yet he is still close to the armed forces. Military men finance his party, and one of its biggest supporters is Ibrahim Babangida, among Nigeria's less savory former military rulers. That money allowed Mr. Obasanjo to build a political machine that won a majority in both houses of parliament in elections earlier in February. Desperately needed economic reforms and anti-corruption measures will anger officers, the main beneficiaries of the present morass. Reversing the poverty and environmental destruction of the Delta is another urgent task that may be hindered by Mr. Obasanjo's links to the armed forces, which are hated there. Those ties may also prevent him from calming ethnic tensions. He is a Yoruba from Nigeria's southwest, but many Yoruba distrust him, viewing him as closer to the northern army officials who have traditionally run Nigeria. To have any success in tackling these daunting problems, Mr. Obasanjo must make his government not the last stage in a military transition, but the first stage of full civilian rule. http://www.nytimes.com"10-May-99,SOUTH AFRICA (99%);,"When President Nelson Mandela's governing African National Congress issued a 14-page booklet on ""moral renewal"" last week, South Africa's opposition parties barely paused for breath before labeling it ""insulting insincerity."" Enough with the ""pious speech,"" the ""fruitless workshops"" and the ""glossy booklets,"" said the opposition United Democratic Party. The African Christian Democratic Party said much the same. ""To demonstrate that the A.N.C. is serious about moral renewal, it needs to punish immorality and criminal actions by members of its own ranks,"" said the Christian Democrats' president, Kenneth Meshoe. In a country with a jobless rate that may be as high as 40 percent and a crime rate so high that there are an average of 140 murders or attempted murders every day, unemployment and safety are the issues that top the agenda for most South Africans. But with only four weeks to go before this country's second post-apartheid elections, corruption is emerging as a key issue too. Polls indicate that South Africans give the Mr. Mandela's Government a poor rating on rooting out and controlling corruption in its ranks. Only 37 percent of the people taking part in a poll conducted last November by the Institute for Democracy in South Africa said the Government has done a good job in this area. Lately the A.N.C. has begun to take on this issue. It held a conference on corruption last month. The booklet, which encapsulates the topics discussed at the conference, pledges, among other measures, to engage its members in a meaningful debate on the subject. In addition, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who is expected to become the country's next President, is holding daylong public hearings in the country's three most populous provinces to ""obtain first hand impressions"" about the problem. At the first session in Soweto last week, many of those who took to the microphones could hardly control their anger and frustration. Hospital employees said some doctors and nurses sold medical files to lawyers involved in insurance scams; crime victims told of watching perpetrators go free because ""suddenly"" the evidence had disappeared, and township residents told of paying money to housing officials for houses that never materialized. Most wore A.N.C. buttons and T-shirts or waved party flags and talked of low-level corruption. But one elderly man withstood the boos of the crowd to aim higher. ""Don't come to us only when it is election time because you will not know all our concerns,"" he said, adding that the A.N.C. needs to root out corruption in its own ranks before coming to the people. Mr. Mbeki simply stared at him. Many experts say the way South Africa's first black Government has handled allegations of corruption has left it vulnerable to criticism. Certainly corruption is nothing new to South Africa. Experts say there may well have been more of it under the former apartheid Government, although information about it was far more tightly controlled then. The Government's leading corruption investigator, Justice Willem Heath, says he has recovered millions of dollars in recent years, much of it from corrupt officials who were operating long before Mr. Mandela was elected in 1994. But some experts point out that the A.N.C. tends to circle the wagons when allegations of corruption are made against its own members, particularly those who were active during the anti-apartheid struggle. ""The A.N.C. has not always acted swiftly and cleanly in dealing with corruption,"" said Tom Lodge, a political analyst with the University of Witwatersrand. ""They are always saying: 'We'll have to wait and see. There has been no conviction yet.' Whereas in many countries, just an allegation of corruption and you are out."" Even in recent months, with the elections coming up, the A.N.C. appears to have made several missteps in this area. For instance, when it unveiled its preliminary list of candidates in March, opposition parties had a field day. Democratic Party officials quickly found 17 who they said had questionable records. The New National Party, another opposition group, found 12. The allegations ranged from the petty to the serious and included one candidate who had been convicted of attempted murder. Several others were under investigation for fraud. Eventually, seven candidates were dropped from the list. Mr. Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who has been convicted of kidnapping and could face further charges relating to the activities of her bodyguards in the late 1980's, remains high on the final list of candidates. She is still extremely popular among the poorest South Africans and has been a potent campaigner for the party. Only a few weeks ago, the A.N.C. was embroiled in another controversy that critics saw as more evidence of loose standards when it came to those with ""struggle credentials."" It nominated a lawyer, Ramesh Vassen, to be South Africa's consul general to India. While Mr. Vassen was once a member of the present Justice Minister's law firm and an anti-apartheid activist, he also turns out to have been convicted of stealing money from client trust funds. At first, A.N.C. officials defended their choice, though eventually Mr. Vassen's nomination was withdrawn. Critics of the A.N.C. see a far broader pattern of ethical laxness. They point to incidents ranging from the hero's welcome that was afforded to another anti-apartheid activist, Allan Boesak, when he returned to face charges of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from his own foundation (he was convicted) to the refusal to take any action at all against the Health Minister, Nkosazana Zuma. Her department had been accused of wasting millions of dollars on an extravagant and ineffective AIDS prevention play, called Sarafina 2. Investigators have concluded that the awarding of the contract for the play was highly irregular. There is little doubt that the A.N.C. will win the June 2 national and provincial elections anyhow. It is still riding a wave of loyalty for its role in bringing apartheid to an end. But the party wants a two-thirds majority, which would give it the power to change the constitution if it wants to. So every vote counts. And party officials, obviously, believe that the corruption issue is hurting them. On the campaign trail, Mr. Mbeki often deplores corruption and calls on everyone to take action against it. When Mr. Mbeki finally rose to speak at the Chiawelo Community Center in Soweto recently he urged the audience to fight back. In the measured tones that have become his trademark as a speaker, he suggested that while there was no bed linen left at the local hospital, many of them could see hospital linen hanging from their neighbors' washing lines. They must take steps to report their neighbors, he said. ""Government cannot succeed if you just sit here,"" he said. Mr. Mbeki has been outspoken about the need for moral rejuvenation. He argues that the years under apartheid have left the country in ""a threatening state of moral degradation."" But some analysts say that the A.N.C.'s recent efforts to confront corruption -- the conference, the booklet and Mr. Mbeki's tours -- are simply a way of focusing attention away from the Government's handling of the problem.  ""What they are doing right now is a political strategy to cope with the fallout,"" Mr. Lodge said. ""These are not an anti-corruption measure.""  http://www.nytimes.com"1-Nov-98,"AFRICA (94%); CHINA (92%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (92%); EUROPE (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%); SWEDEN (92%); HOLY SEE (91%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (79%); UGANDA (79%); CENTRAL AFRICA (79%); RWANDA (79%); ASIA (79%);","More Swedish Fire Victims Identified GOTEBORG, Sweden -- Forensic specialists examining badly burned bodies identified more of the 60 young people who died early Friday morning when fire engulfed a crowded dance hall.

Malaysian to Be Tried on More Sex Charges KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Fired Malaysian finance minister Anwar Ibrahim will be tried on additional sex charges after facing two trials on corruption and sodomy that are expected to last at least eight months, the chief prosecutor said. In two successive trials that go to the heart of Malaysia's political unrest, Anwar faces five counts of corruption and five of sodomy, all of which he denies. The first corruption trial begins on Monday.

Arafat spoke a day after his Palestinian Authority approved the latest Middle East peace deal despite opposition by several of his cabinet's 30 members. Asked about his crackdown on Hamas militants since the bombing on Thursday that killed one Israeli soldier but did not harm the children, Arafat said: ""It [Hamas] has conducted terrorist military operations, the latest of which targeted a bus full of schoolchildren. Thank God a military escort received the strike instead of the bus.""

The exercises -- called Zolfaqar-2 after the sword of Imam Ali, the son-in-law of Islam's Prophet Muhammad -- are occurring against a background of tension with Afghanistan. Relations between the two nations deteriorated sharply in September after the Taliban militia, which controls most of Afghanistan, admitted that its forces had killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist in the northern city of Mazar-e Sharif.  ""Russia will not go down on its knees. Everyone should be firmly aware of that."" Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov -- Page A1"30-Jun-14,ZIMBABWE (94%);,"Tonya Putnam is an assistant professor at the Department of Political Science of Columbia University French banking giant BNP Paribas was just hit with an $8.9 billion fine resulting from a combined settlement with federal and state government agencies. The reason? Extraterritorial violations of U.S. laws that prohibit private banks anywhere in the world from using U.S. dollars to transact with Iran, Sudan, Syria and other states under U.S. sanction. The unprecedented size of this penalty, which stems from transactions with Sudanese companies between 2002 and 2007, is raising eyebrows on both sides of the Atlantic-along with European hackles. Especially galling to many, including finance journalist Felix Salmon, is that the laws BNP Paribas violated have little or nothing to do with protecting the international banking system. Instead, they exist to serve U.S. foreign policy goals of isolating politically recalcitrant regimes. France, like the United States, wants to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, and both countries condemn the Sudanese government's brutal actions in Darfur. However, the U.S. and French governments differ on what to do about it. Consequently, U.S. efforts to force foreign banks to follow U.S. policies instead of those of their own governments are a source of foreign resentment ... and not only in France. So, who gets to decide which laws, if any, govern banks, corporations and other non-state entities whose activities affect multiple countries simultaneously? This is a question of growing importance as the world becomes more interdependent. The answer will not surprise you (spoiler alert: it's the exceptionally powerful states), but the scope and character of the mechanism might. Extraterritorial restrictions on dealings with political antagonists of the United States grab headlines. But they are far from the only examples of U.S. extraterritoriality. Other areas where the United States has a history of throwing its weight around using U.S. laws and institutions to regulate conduct outside U.S. borders include antitrust, securities, bankruptcy, trademark protection, anti-corruption efforts and human rights. Only a few states have any real capacity to enforce their own laws extraterritorially on a wide scale. Extraterritorial capacity, in this view, means using ties to a state's territory, markets and institutions to claim direct legal authority over conduct outside its borders. Because so many large enterprises have links to the United States, U.S. law has considerable reach. Banking is a prime example, since no large international bank can avoid dealing in U.S. currency. For private entities that fear becoming targets of U.S. extraterritorial regulation, the bite is this: The very ties that provide a basis (under U.S. law) for U.S. jurisdiction in the first place are often connected to assets that later can be seized to satisfy penalties for violations. Transnational actors thus disregard U.S. law at their peril. For this reason, the strategic ones invest heavily in figuring out when, where, and against whom U.S. law might be brought to bear. The motivation is often to evade U.S. law. Even so, the threat of U.S. enforcement affects behavior, keeping it closer to the U.S. ideal than it would otherwise be. This is because selective market avoidance, complex corporate structures, and arms-length models of control provide only so much insulation against U.S. extraterritoriality. Even highly sophisticated entities at times fail to anticipate how U.S. authorities will interpret the scope of U.S. law, and what it requires. They can also miscalculate U.S. enforcement priorities, or the incentives of other private entities to sue in U.S. courts. All of this, in turn, enables the U.S. government to maintain policies that may be quite unpopular internationally. Notable examples include long-standing U.S. trade sanctions against Cuba, and strict U.S. rules against horizontal market collusion among private firms. Do options exist for countering unwelcome instances of U.S. extraterritoriality? Foreign governments have long tried to find ways to restrain the United States with limited success. One emerging possibility for checking U.S. assertiveness is reciprocal actions from the European Union, which now rivals the United States in the size of its internal market. As David Bach and Abraham Newman show, Europe is already well aware that it can leverage trade access to incentivize outsiders to adopt European standards in areas ranging from product specifications to data privacy. However, Europeans have shown few signs of mirroring U.S. extraterritorial practices. The reasons why are complex, but significant. First, Europeans have long been critical of U.S.-style jurisdictional unilateralism and often underscore its poor fit with international law. Second, regulatory enforcement in Europe is still largely the job of public officials, whereas in the United States private litigants can directly initiate extraterritorial enforcement of many U.S. public laws using domestic courts. Sometimes this entails simply doubling down on those already convicted of criminal violations with further suits for private damages. (Europe is only now beginning to experiment with this type of private enforcement in the competition law arena.) However, it is also common in the U.S. system for private litigants to independently select when, where, and against whom U.S. regulatory authority will be directed, even when this creates problems for U.S. foreign policy. This is not to suggest that U.S. courts do the bidding of just any plaintiff, American or foreign, that seeks to have U.S. law enforced extraterritorially. Far from it. Figuring out when U.S. courts have applied U.S. laws extraterritorially, when not, and why it matters for international affairs is the subject of my book (nearing completion) as well as my 2009 article in International Organization. The Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), has engaged in a recent fining frenzy. Coupled with the U.S. Supreme Court's approval last week of broad extraterritorial discovery of Argentina's foreign assets to enforce repayment of defaulted bonds, this might suggest a new wave of American legal aggressiveness. However, my research suggests it is actually becoming more difficult to get U.S. federal courts to interpret the extraterritorial reach of ambiguous U.S. laws expansively. This is evident in decisions handed down over the last decade in issues ranging from human rights to securities regulation. This reticence may be a sign of waning U.S. hegemony, or the product of dynamics internal to the U.S. judiciary - or both. What is clear is that a growing coterie of textual literalists on the Supreme Court is doing more to reel in U.S. extraterritoriality using a judicially constructed ""presumption against extraterritoriality""_than have decades of foreign criticism Mugabe Urged to Reopen College  The closing of the University of Zimbabwe by the Government last week has led to a chorus of outrage here, and President Robert Mugabe's Government has responded to the dismay with further measures to stifle dissent. The university was closed indefinitely last Wednesday after students rioted and threw stones at the police. All 8,000 students were ordered off the campus in suburban Harare and all grants and scholarships were suspended. The Government announced that it would press charges against nearly 40 students arrested by the police on Wednesday. The students are still in custody, and there is no word on when the university, the only one in the country, might reopen. Church figures, professors, opposition politicians and union leaders have all called for the Government to reopen the university and to adopt a more conciliatory attitude toward the students. But such appeals appear to have had little effect in softening the official stand. On Friday, the Government arrested the Secretary General of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, Morgan Tsvangirai, after he issued a strongly worded condemnation of the university shutdown and voiced support for the students. Emergency Powers Criticized The document criticized the Government's use of emergency powers to arrest student leaders. The sweeping emergency powers were created in 1965 by the white minority Government to stamp out black nationalism. The powers give the Government the ability to detain an individual indefinitely without trial. The union statement said the continued use of the emergency powers by the Mugabe Government was a ''clear manifestation of rising state repression . . . against women, university lecturers, workers and trade unionists.'' Mr. Tsvangirai was taken from the trade union offices in handcuffs by three plainclothes policemen. The police are also holding two student leaders whose arrests early Wednesday set off a clash between stone-throwing students and policemen firing tear gas. A meeting of bishops from the Catholic, Anglican and other leading churches met last Thursday to discuss the incident and urged the Government to reopen the university. The campus troubles started over an attempt to hold a seminar on Sept. 29 to mark the first anniversary of student anti-corruption riots, which led to a judicial inquiry into official corruption early this year, bringing about the resignation of five Cabinet ministers."15-Dec-74,UNITED STATES (95%); SOMALIA (79%);,"Labor unions, univ student orgns, other groups press for release of Aper Aku, Nigerian businessman jailed under emergency decrees more than 3 mos ago after charging, in apparently defectively researched affidavit, that Benue-Plateau State Gov Comr Joseph D Gomwalk illegally profited from his office.

B8 Traffic Alert B3 Chronicle B15"26-Nov-93,NIGERIA (97%);,"Nigeria's new military ruler named a politically diverse Cabinet today that includes allies of the apparent winner of the presidential election in June. The Cabinet of 32 ministers is to be sworn in on Saturday, a Government statement said. Although no portfolios were stated on the Cabinet list, political analysts said the line-up was probably the most experienced since independence from Britain 33 years ago. ""This list is like a Who's Who of Nigeria's contemporary politics,"" one political commentator said. Absent from the list was the apparent winner in June, Moshood Abiola, who has kept a low profile since the interim government was taken over last week. Today Mr. Abiola criticized the return of the military, but said he was not calling on his supporters to rise up against it. But he said the election results should be allowed to stand. Mr. Abiola was leading in the vote when it was annulled by General Babangida, plunging Nigeria into its worst political crisis since the Biafra civil war of 1967-70. Among those named to the Cabinet were Iyorchia Ayu, former leader of the Senate and an ally of Mr. Abiola as well as his running mate, Baba Gana Kingibe, who has been named Foreign Minister. It also includes members of the last Cabinet, former Oil Minister Don Etiebet, who began an anti-corruption crusade at the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation in September, and former Finance Minister Aminu Saleh. General Abacha justified his takeover as necessary to save Nigeria from collapse. And 24 hours after taking charge, he banned politics and dismantled all political institutions. The general, who is Nigeria's seventh military ruler, has been an influential member of every administration since the last democratic government was toppled by the military in 1983. He has yet to announce any political program but has pledged that the military will not stay in power long. On Wednesday, the military government installed a Provisional Ruling Council, of which General Abacha is chairman and Defense Minister."29-Dec-97,,"For Willis Juma, the decision to vote against the governing party in Kenya's presidential election on Monday comes down to his aching back. Though he has a degree in accounting, the only job Mr. Juma could find after college was part-time work lifting sacks of coffee for about $3 a day. He lives in a shantytown where there are no paved roads or sewers and where a cholera epidemic is raging. ""We are being suppressed by the Government in so many ways,"" Mr. Juma, 25, said Saturday at a rally here for an opposition candidate. ""You can't get a job unless you are politically correct. We are paying a lot of money in taxes, but if you go to the hospital you can't get even those simple tablets like aspirin."" Like many Kenyans, Mr. Juma blames years of official corruption and mismanagement under President Daniel arap Moi for his situation. For two decades, Mr. Moi, 74, and his party have run this once prosperous former British colony with a mixture of graft and mismanagement. But even though a majority of the nine million Kenyans registered to vote are expected to cast their ballots for opposition candidates, Mr. Moi is still favored to win the election, because he faces 13 challengers deeply divided along ethnic lines, diplomats and analysts say. In 1991 Mr. Moi reluctantly bowed to heavy international pressure and ended the monopoly on power held by his party, the Kenya African National Union. But Kenya's first multiparty elections, in 1992, were marred by ethnic clashes in the Rift Valley, a Moi political stronghold. Hundreds of people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced as supporters of Mr. Moi, who is from the Kalejin minority, attacked people from large ethnic groups who supported other candidates. Opposition candidates also faced enormous obstacles in 1992. The Government-owned radio and television stations ignored their campaigns, while local officials loyal to Mr. Moi harassed opposition leaders at every turn, barring them from entering the President's political strongholds. At the same time, the governing party printed money and used it to buy votes in the hinterlands, international election observers said. Despite these advantages, Mr. Moi drew only 37 percent of the vote. He won anyway, largely because the opposition was so divided that it could not agree on a single challenger. This year, violent pro-democracy protests over the summer and harsh criticism from industrialized countries that provide economic aid again compelled Mr. Moi to agree to political reforms. In October his party repealed several laws that allowed the President to jail opponents and ban opposition parties. The reforms also barred local officials and the police from taking part in politics, expanded the electoral commission to include opposition representatives and ordered the Government news media to give equal time to challengers. Days after the reforms were passed, Mr. Moi announced a three-week campaign to be waged in the Christmas season, insuring that his opponents would have little time to take advantage of the new political playing field. Mr. Moi's most formidable challenger is a former Vice President, Mwai Kibaki, an economist and political insider with strong support from Kenya's largest ethnic group, the Kikuyu. Mr. Kibaki has promised to stamp out corruption, revive the economy and give every child a free primary education. Another strong challenger is Charity Ngilu, a businesswoman and member of Parliament from the relatively small Akamba group. She has positioned herself as a compromise candidate for people who are disenchanted with Mr. Moi but still suspicious of candidates from the larger groups like Mr. Kibaki. ""I realized that opposition leaders were never going to unite, never going to allow Kenyans that one single candidate,"" she told reporters recently. ""So I created that alternative leader Kenyans were looking for."" For the last three weeks, the opposition candidates have scrambled around the country by car, preaching to small crowds at roadsides and in parking lots, looking for the right oratorical formula to dislodge one of Africa's longest-serving presidents. Mr. Moi, meanwhile, has taken full advantage of his office, traveling from town to town in his presidential jet. His speeches are attended by the trappings of power -- police bands, choirs, crowds of schoolchildren singing his praises and thousands of loyal party members, some of whom are paid to attend. But the President's tone has changed since 1992. At a recent rally, he railed about Kenya's bad roads and poor hospitals as if he were a political outsider. Where he once imperiously ordered supporters to vote for him and threatened to crush opponents with force, he is now begging for understanding and support. ""I'm asking you to vote for me,"" he said, holding up his trademark ivory and gold scepter. ""If you know I will make some contribution or I have played my part in contributing toward the development of Kenya, vote for me."" But that development is hard to see. Per capita income has fallen from $700 at independence in 1963 to about $270 now. Economic growth this year will be less than 2 percent. About four million college and high school graduates do not have jobs. One recent study placed the gap between rich and poor here second only to that in Brazil. Power and water shortages are common even in Nairobi, the capital. The roads, neglected for years, are falling apart. Even the main highway from the port of Mombasa to Nairobi is nearly impassable in places. It is a country where most of the 28 million people buy their clothes used and live in slums without running water, where people sleep two to a bed in the capital's best public hospital, where most college graduates take menial jobs or remain unemployed for years. ""Young people like me, you go to school, you go to training, you get out and you don't get employment,"" said Juma Nassur, 34, an unemployed auto mechanic who supports Raila Odinga, a young liberal member of Parliament. ""Our Government is corrupt."" Among the oppposition candidates, Mr. Kibaki, who was a top member of Mr. Moi's Cabinet until 1992, has cast himself as an anti-corruption crusader. On the hustings, he accuses Mr. Moi and his cronies of stealing millions from development projects. Over and over, he hammers the themes of stolen tax money, bad roads and poorly stocked hospitals. ""This Government is full of thieves,"" Mr. Kibaki told a crowd of about 10,000 supporters today in Uhuru Park in Nairobi. ""The taxes you pay are enough to fix the roads. They are enough to buy medicine, to do repairs to the hospitals, to pay doctors and nurses, to educate primary school students."" But it is Ms. Ngilu's campaign that has generated the most excitement. Having served only one term in Parliament, the 45-year-old bakery owner and restaurateur is seen by many as a fresh face in politics, untainted by scandal. She has promised to serve just five years, to stanch bribery and rewrite the Constitution to give less power to the President. Her campaign has attracted many women across ethnic lines, as well as underemployed young men and middle-class Ken yans who are tired of the old-school politicians. By and large, the campaigning has gone ahead with little interference from the police or local officials, diplomats say. The election, in which 210 parliamentary seats are also at stake, is one of the most scrutinized in Kenya's history. Financed by $2.5 million from foreign donors, Kenyan church organizations have deployed more than 840 monitors to watch the campaigners on the road and more than 27,000 poll watchers to go to voting sites on Monday. ""Generally the situation is much better than it was in 1992,"" Sam Kabue, a church official who heads the campaign monitoring group said. ""There is less intimidation and more freedom for people to go out and say what they want."" Even if there is no election rigging, none of the challengers have a chance of winning on the first ballot, analysts said. Mr. Moi's coalition of smaller ethnic groups, who would fear a Kikuyu or Luo as President, appears to be holding together, while the other main candidates lack strong support outside their own groups. But the opposition does has a slim hope of forcing a runoff election. That is because an unusual electoral rule requires the leading vote-getter to garner at least a quarter of the votes in five of the country's eight provinces or face a runoff with the second-place candidate. Mr. Moi won easily in the first round in 1992, when he made a respectable showing in the Akamba and the Luhyia communities. But Ms. Ngilu's candidacy may make it hard for Mr. Moi to get a quarter of the votes in the Eastern Province, where her Akamba group is the majority, and Mr. Wamalwa could lock him out of the Western Province, where his Luyhia are the majority. With two other provinces already expected to go to opposition candidates, this is a scenario Mr. Moi wants to avoid. A runoff might unite the anti-Moi vote behind the second-place candidate. And even if Mr. Moi wins the election as expected, the fundamental problems facing his Government are not about to go away. Neither is the unhappiness among the working and middle classes. ""The Government is out of touch with the feelings of the common man,"" said John Mbugua, a Ngilu supporter who sells electrical goods from a street stall in Nairobi. ""Under the present Government, it has completely collapsed. We don't even have roads you can talk about. ""Sometimes I feel hopeless. Saying I feel sad is not enough. We are drifting toward the unknown."""30-Dec-97,KENYA (99%);,"Kenya was thrown into a political crisis today after officials extended the presidential election to a second day because of widespread logistical problems. Opposition leaders immediately accused the Government of trying to rig the voting. Many polling places were so swamped with crowds of frustrated voters at 6 this evening, when polls were supposed to close, that the Kenya Electoral Commission ordered a second day of voting, raising questions about how the Government would safeguard ballot boxes overnight. The decision fanned fears among opposition candidates that the governing party was going to stuff ballot boxes to insure a fifth term for President Daniel arap Moi, the 74-year-old strongman who has been in power in Kenya since 1978. Some presidential candidates threatened to reject the election results and take to the streets unless the ballot boxes were kept in under guard in polling places overnight. They also demanded that election officials begin at once to count ballots in constituencies where no problems were reported. ""The election commission has been infiltrated and is being manipulated by the Government with the intention of distorting the results of this election,"" Mwai Kibaki, the Democratic Party's candidate, said tonight. Election officials declined to comment on these accusations, though they acknowledged that the voting had been hampered by bad weather, delays and confusion. Floods prevented voting in much of northeastern Kenya, where some residents tried to paddle boats to their polling stations. Some polling places did not receive enough presidential ballots for all of their registered voters. In other places, the ballots were delivered late or sent to the wrong locations, causing three- and four-hour delays in the opening of polls. The accusations of vote-rigging came at the end of a chaotic day in which millions of Kenyans walked for miles and stood in line for hours to vote. In most of the country, the voting was more peaceful than many people had predicted. Two people were reported killed in political violence today, far fewer than the hundreds who died in ethnic clashes leading up to the 1992 election. A small riot broke out in the town of Ngong when Mr. Moi's Vice President, George Saitoti, who represents the area and is facing a tough re-election campaign, arrived at a polling station with several extra ballot boxes. No one was hurt in the fracas, but just after 7:15 the police fired in the air to disperse the crowd, which had stoned Mr. Saitoti's car and burned the extra ballot boxes, a witness said. Mr. Moi is unpopular with most Kenyans because rampant official corruption and inept management in his administration have deeply eroded this once prosperous country's economy over the last two decades, diplomats and political experts say. Still, Mr. Moi was expected to win the election, largely because he still can pull about 40 percent of the vote and faces a field of 12 challengers (as well as two who have dropped out but are still on the ballot) deeply divided along ethnic lines. Unable to agree on a single challenger, the opposition's sole hope for victory lay in forcing a runoff, which might unite the anti-Moi vote behind the second-place candidate. The problems at the polls today, however, have given opposition leaders ammunition for their charge that Mr. Moi is trying to steal the election.  Some challengers were already predicting violence if Mr. Moi is re-elected. One was Charity Ngilu, a 45-year-old member of Parliament and businesswoman whose anti-corruption message has attracted many Kenyans. She has asserted that Mr. Moi's agents have tried to buy votes in her home district of Kitui and are paying her supporters to give up their voting cards. She maintained that she had found evidence to support her claims -- about 400 voter cards hidden in a bottom desk drawer of the local election officer -- after she and her backers stormed the election commissions offices in Kitui this morning. The officer denied any wrongdoing, saying the cards had not been bought but were duplicates made for people who had lost the originals. ""If Moi wins, we will not allow him to take over,"" Ms. Ngilu said later. ""If he wins, it's going to be very difficult for him to manage. Kenyans are very angry and I will incite my people. People in other places will also incite their people."" Mr. Kibaki, the former Vice President and a top contender, said tonight that the election commission had deliberately sent too few presidential ballots to his strongholds to hamper the voting. For instance, the district of Gagaki, on the slopes of Mount Kenya, he said, the polling station received only 400 ballots for President, when it has 4,000 registered voters. More ballots were delivered after a five-hour delay. The same thing happened in at least 29 other constituencies where the opposition is strong, he said. ""We know it could not have been an accident,"" he said. In Nairobi, several polling stations opened three or four hours late because ballots had not been delivered on time and poll officials were unprepared. At a primary school in the Westlands area, for instance, people stood in lines two city blocks long and waited for three hours just to get into the polling station. Despite the long lines, most voters did not give up. Many said the election was too important to their futures to abandon their rights just because of a long wait under a hot sun. ""I'm exercising my democratic right to vote,"" said Richard Wanjohi, 40, a contractor, who had been in line for three hours. ""I really want to see that I have a change in the Government."" But in other parts of Kenya, which has 28 million residents divided among 42 ethnic groups, the voting went off without a hitch. The atmosphere was much less tense than in 1992, when ethnic clashes at voting places and intimidation by soldiers and the police was common. In Kajiado, for instance, a Rift Valley town 40 miles south of the capital, long lines of Masai men and women, dressed in traditional garb, voted peacefully while election monitors watched. Each polling station had only three soldiers, who generally kept a low profile. More than half of the voters in Kajiado were illiterate, however, election officials said. They were shown which box to mark on the ballot while representatives from all the parties watched. Several of the Masai said they still supported Mr. Moi, despite the corruption and lack of Government services in the region. They said they were afraid that a president from one of the larger tribes, like the Kikuyu or Luo, would do even less for them. Mr. Moi comes from the small Tugen subgroup of the Kalenjin tribe. ""Moi is not a bad man, but it is his servants who are bad,"" said Olerisa Leintoy, a 40-year-old Masai woman. ""Because we are a small tribe we have to support Moi."" Forty miles to the northeast, in Machakos, a stronghold of Ms. Ngilu's Akamba tribe, hundreds of voters waited for three hours under a blistering sun to cast their votes at a station in the Machakos Show Grounds. Many said they supported Ms. Ngilu and believed that she could clean up the Government, because she was a relative newcomer to politics, untainted by graft. ""We just hope for a total change, a reversal of the trends,"" said Josiah Musyoka, a 41-year-old furniture maker. ""I think everybody is really fed up now."""31-Dec-97,KENYA (99%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%);,"Kenya's general election degenerated into confusion today as both President Daniel arap Moi and opposition candidates accused the beleaguered Kenyan Electoral Commission of rigging the election against them. As polls finally closed this afternoon after a unexpected second day of voting and the counting of ballots slowly got under way, politicians on all sides were already laying the groundwork for rejecting the results. In a statement read on the state radio, President Moi accused the 21-member commission of involvement ""in a scheme to rig the ongoing general elections in favor of the opposition."" His statement came a day after three leading opposition candidates asserted that the electoral commission had deliberately sent too few ballots to opposition strongholds to hinder voting. Questions about the election raised fears among many Kenyans and diplomats that there might be a resurgence of political violence. Pro-democracy protests took 12 lives and rocked this country's economy last summer. ""You have a situation where whoever loses is going to have the ability to say the process has been rigged,"" said a diplomat who insisted on anonymity. ""The question now is how many people are going to scream, and how loudly and what else will they do?"" The election pits Mr. Moi, 74, who has been President since 1978, against more than a dozen challengers who are divided along tribal lines. The President, whose administration has been marked by corruption and a crumbling economy, was expected to win a fifth term narrowly with about 40 percent of the vote because the anti-incumbent vote is so splintered, political experts said. But the polling on Monday descended into chaos in many parts of this East African country because of bad weather, logistical problems, mismanagement and disorganization among local election officials. Late Monday night, with crowds of frustrated voters still waiting for ballots at many of the 13,600 polling stations, the commission extended the voting by a day. Today, more reports of irregularities filtered into the capital from across the country even as voting continued in some regions and ballot counting started in places where the polling had gone smoothly on Monday. There were widespread instances in which ballots were sent to the wrong polling stations. In many cases, there were too few presidential ballots for the number of registered voters. Some polling stations in the Rift Valley did not open until 3 in the afternoon for lack of ballots. Some in western Kenya did not open at all on Monday. There were also numerous reports of violence between various political factions, vote-buying outside polling stations, the buying and destruction of voter cards, missing ballot boxes, intimidation, and in at least one district, burned ballot boxes and destroyed ballots. Worried that the voting would be rigged to give Mr. Moi a victory, many party workers spent the night guarding ballot boxes in polling stations and vote-counting locations across the country. Although the official election observers from foreign embassies and church groups had not finished compiling their reports, some diplomats and political experts estimated that at least a quarter of the country's 210 parliamentary constituencies were affected by the irregularities. But they added that many of the problems had been rectified on the second day of polling, and it did not appear that the irregularities would skew the election results. The political damage, however, had already been done by the allegations of rigging, they said. Gabriel K. Mukele, the vice chairman of the election commission, said most of the problems had resulted from mistakes made by the company in England that had printed the ballots. He said that in some cases the printer had packed ballot books in the wrong crates, causing them to be sent to the wrong constituencies. Mr. Mukele also acknowledged that local election officials had made errors, often sending the wrong number of presidential ballots to polling stations. He denied charges, however, that the election commission, which has representatives from both the governing party and the opposition, had created the problems to hurt one candidate or another. ""Some officers did not do the distribution properly,"" he said. ""What is not true is that the ballots were sent in small quantities selectively to favor one candidate."" For security reasons, Mr. Mukele said the ballots were shipped to Kenya from England just days before the election and the crates were not opened until the night before the polling. This was done at election headquarters in far-flung districts. As a result, election officers did not discover until a few hours before the polls were to open that many ballots had been misdirected. In addition, he said, heavy flooding and muddy roads had hampered the distribution of ballots in less developed parts of the country, like the Rift Valley and the northeast. Helicopters were used to ferry the ballots to those areas today, he said. Kenya is the size of Texas and has 28 million inhabitants. Defending the commission's work, Mr. Mukele said the irregularities affected only about 5 percent of the constituencies and ""are not serious enough to lead to considering these elections as faulty in my view."" He said the mix-ups in delivering ballot papers had been remedied today. ""There is suspicion in Kenya,"" he said. ""And our politics are ethnically based. Everyone wants to be at the top. Allegations come very early. Anything that someone might imagine might happen is put out to everyone as a fact."" ""The politicians don't trust one another,"" he added, ""and they make wild allegations for the consumption of the simple people and they are taken as fact by their tribal followers."" But Kenyan election observers and pro-democracy advocates disagreed vehemently. A statement by election observers said there had been ""major shortcomings in the voting exercise,"" while the main pro-democracy advocacy group that organized the demonstrations last summer called the election ""irredeemably flawed"" and a ""fantastic farce."" The top presidential challengers, meanwhile, continued to cry foul. ""Moi has rigged the process as he did in 1992, just that this time round he will not fool anybody,"" Raila Odinga, the candidate for the National Development Party, told Reuters. ""We are prepared for him, and we are ready to take him head on."" The atmosphere was tense at counting stations in Nairobi and Machakos today, as election officials began going through the ballots by hand with hundreds of party loyalists and riot police officers crowded around outside the stations. It was slow going. For instance, it took more than two hours this morning and several shouting matches to count the first ballot box for the presidential race in Nairobi City Hall. There were 371 other boxes stacked up at one end of the hall. The ballots were sorted into piles by a dozen clerks while angry party representatives scowled at them and objected several times. ""By tomorrow we should be through,"" said Jane Karanja, a weary election official in charge of the counting. ""I'm praying for that."" In the town of Machakos, about 40 miles south of the capital, people were edgy at the Machakos Social Hall, where counting began this morning. The town is a stronghold of Charity Ngilu, the 45-year-old businesswoman and political newcomer whose anti-corruption message threatened to break Mr. Moi's hold on the Eastern Province. A crowd of 200 Ngilu supporters waited outside hall for news while officials dumped out the paper ballots on tables in front of party agents and went through them. Each time a box showed a majority for Mr. Moi, an angry murmur rose from the crowd. ""Tell them if they are stealing votes, we will burn this place down!"" shouted Kioko Maundu, a 24-year-old unemployed man. ""They are thieves."""4-Dec-85,UGANDA (94%);,"  Bob Astles, once an aide to the dictator Idi Amin, was freed today after six years in prison. Mr. Astles, a Briton who came to Uganda in 1949, was head of Mr. Amin's anti-corruption squad before the regime was deposed in 1979. He also held Ugandan citizenship but renounced it to obtain his release."25-Sep-11,"TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (95%); AFRICA (93%); KENYA (92%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%);","Nyamata, Rwanda The white altar cloth in the Catholic Church of Nyamata is still stained brown with blood. Shoes, dresses and trousers worn by families massacred within the sanctuary lie, gently decaying, atop the pews. The hole in the church's iron door, blown open years ago by a grenade, will never be repaired: The Catholic Church of Nyamata is now a museum, a memorial to the thousands of people murdered here in April 1994, at the peak of the Rwandan genocide. When I stepped outside, I could hear a congregation singing: A new church has been built next door. Around the corner, I could hear children in their classrooms, hard at work on a Saturday. Along the road to Kigali, the Rwandan capital, trees have been planted. Development economists and aid mavens know very well the story of Rwanda's remarkable recovery. But the country's achievements may be less appreciated by the wider public. Seventeen years after more than 800,000 ethnic Tutsis were murdered in just a few months by their Hutu neighbors, Rwanda has 7 percent economic growth, near-universal health insurance and fierce anti-corruption laws. Kigali is remarkably clean and relatively safe. Some 40 percent of Rwandans own cellphones. National identity cards now identify people as ""Rwandan,"" not Hutu or Tutsi. It is the ambition of Paul Kagame, the Rwandan president - and former leader of the Tutsi exile army that conquered the country in the genocide's wake - to go much further. While visiting one Rwandan government agency I accidentally picked up some notes left by previous visitors, an advisory team from Singapore. Their presence was no accident: Lee Kwan Yew's benign authoritarianism is widely admired here, and some of his methods are in evident use. The former Singaporean leader infamously banned chewing gum in his country. Kagame has banned plastic bags - they aren't biodegradeable - and requires all Rwandans to wear shoes. But there are limits to copying the Singaporean model. Rwanda is landlocked, and it has difficult neighbors. A truck leaving Kigali takes at least four days to reach Mombasa, Kenya, the nearest port. Worse, the driver will pay, according to one survey, $864 in bribes at 36 roadblocks along the way. Much though it might like to be an export-led African tiger, Rwanda's geography prevents it. Rwanda's government has, as a result, set an ambitious goal: to become a ""services hub"" for central Africa or, in the local jargon, a ""knowledge- and information-based economy."" Toward that end, the government has begun laying fiber-optic cable across the country and has been vigorously courting foreign investors (Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim was in town just a few days ago). And here is where Rwanda's ambitious economic plans run into Rwanda's political reality. Though some opposition is legal, and though people in the capital speak openly about the country's deficits, the Rwandan press is weak and journalists are downtrodden. Some have been murdered. Others are in jail. Many have fled the country. All are considered fair game for bullying, and not only by the government. One journalist showed me an e-mail he received from a local nongovernmental organization that wanted him to publish a photograph. Its conclusion: ""Please post the picture online and if not, please give a clear explanation as to why not."" Until now, Kagame and his ministers have argued - citing the track record in Singapore and elsewhere - that control of the press, of politics and of speech was essential to the preservation of what still seems, to them, a fragile peace. Their fear of destructive criticism - and of losing power - is not excusable, but it is understandable, given their history: The current political elite is largely composed of members of the Tutsi minority who with Kagame fought their way back into the country in 1994, where they found piles of corpses. Supporters of the old regime live across the border in Congo, or so current leaders believe, and still write angry denunciations of the regime from their exile. And yet no government that prohibits the free circulation of information can create a ""knowledge- and information-based economy."" Even leaving aside the ethics, nobody will invest in a ""services hub"" where people fear speaking the truth. Some of Rwanda's leaders at the very highest levels know this and are pushing broad media reforms; I was in Rwanda with the Legatum Institute  - a London-based nonpartisan group devoted to good governance, for which I am director of political studies - to learn about these changes. The Rwandans still have a long way to go, as they themselves will acknowledge. But they may have no choice, for there is a larger point here: In recent years, it has become fashionable in some circles to speak of a ""Beijing consensus,"" a road to growth and development that eschews democracy, scorns Western models and favors authoritarianism, benign or otherwise. A few years back, Rwandans leapt onto this bandwagon too. It got them a clean capital, fast growth and low crime - quite far, in other words. But how much farther? The development economists and aid mavens often speak of the ""bottlenecks"" in infrastructure and energy supply that might block growth in Rwanda. Maybe it's time to add ""lack of free speech"" to that list. applebaumletters@washpost.com The global discontent  What's intriguing about the eruption of Occupy Wall Street is that it's so similar to other populist movements that are demanding change in nearly every major region of the world. You can't help but wonder if we aren't seeing, as a delayed reaction to the financial crisis of 2008, a kind of ""global spring"" of discontent. Obviously, circumstances differ: The anti-corporate activists gathered in Manhattan's Zuccotti Park  have a different agenda  than the demonstrators in Cairo's  Tahrir Square, or this past summer's rioting street protesters in Britain and Greece, or the anti-corruption marchers in New Delhi. These movements mostly lack leaders or clear ideologies, so they're hard to categorize. But the protesters do share some basics: rejection of traditional political elites; a belief that ""globalization"" benefits the rich more than the masses; anger about intertwined business and political corruption; and the connectedness and empowerment fostered by Facebook and other social media. This neo-populism is all the more striking because it seems to transcend traditional political boundaries. The Tea Party movement may wear conservative colors, but it arose as a protest against elites in Washington and on Wall Street who were seen to be profiting at the expense of everyday people. Occupy Wall Street comes at these same issues from the left, but the two movements have much in common. The Arab Spring is the world's most potent populist movement, sweeping away governments in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. These uprisings began as leaderless explosions of indignation - blurring the usual lines of capitalist and socialist, Muslim and Christian. These cleavages have returned, especially in Egypt. But the core of the revolution there remains a rage against traditional elites. Protests in Europe have the same note of mass indignation. In Greece, Italy and even France, you see the anger of the middle class that their debt-enfeebled governments can't deliver on welfare-state promises. In some countries, such as Britain and Germany, there is unrest, too, among growing immigrant populations that are not tethered to national cultural or political norms. Even in the boom countries, such as China and India, there is the turmoil that comes with rising expectations. According to China's Ministry of Public Security, the country experienced 87,000 incidents of popular unrest in 2005. That's 238 protests a day! The Chinese stopped publishing the number after that, but it surely hasn't gone down. India, too, has seen a rising tide of protest, symbolized by the mass street marches in the summer that surrounded Anna Hazare's hunger strike to protest corruption. It's a stretch, perhaps, to look for shared themes in such disparate countries. But these movements seem to have a common indignation toward leaders who are failing to maintain social justice along with global economic change. That's certainly true in America, where the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street both rage against a financial elite that stumbled into a ruinous recession - and then got bailed out by a Washington elite that's in hock to special interests. The Tea Party, especially, tapped the bedrock American mistrust of big banks, which dates to Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. Growth and prosperity would restore public confidence, as in the past. But this time, the anticipated recovery - and deflation of popular anger - still seems a few years away. Europe's neo-populism will surely increase, as countries struggle with painful economic adjustments. Population is declining in most of Europe, which means there will be fewer young workers to pay for the pensions of retirees. To regain competitiveness and solvency, wages and the quality of life will have to decline in many European countries. Meanwhile, according to a recent study by the National Intelligence Council, by 2025              Western Europe's Muslim population could increase to 25 million to 30 million from the current 15 million to 18 million, causing  additional strains. There's no sign yet of a new European political leadership that can accomplish the necessary rewrite of the social contract. Much of the world's neo-populist anger is justified, given the greed and folly of recent years. What worries me is the echo of the 1930s, a similar period of economic change and dislocation. When the traditional business and political leaders seemed to have failed during the downturn of the '30s, populist indignation veered sharply right and left - toward dangerous movements that expressed national indignation at the point of a gun. America was lucky then to have had, in President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a charismatic politician who could rehabilitate the center. And now? Not so lucky. davidignatius@washpost.com  Egypt          Mubarak sons saidto have $340 million The two sons of ousted president Hosni Mubarak have an estimated $340 million in Swiss bank accounts, a senior Egyptian Justice Ministry official said Monday. Assem al-Gohary said Swiss authorities are investigating whether one of the sons, Alaa, was involved in money laundering along with other regime figures. At home, Mubarak and his sons have been charged with corruption and are under arrest. Mubarak also is charged with complicity in the killing ofabout 850 protesters during theJan. 25-Feb. 11 Egyptian uprising. Switzerland has already frozen the assets of the Mubarak family and other former regime figures, which Gohary estimated at nearly $450 million. In Egypt, the attorney general froze the assets of the former presidential family on Feb. 20. - Associated Press Mexico          61 freed captiveswere migrants Mexican President Felipe Calderon said Monday that 61 men who had been kidnapped by a drug cartel before soldiers rescued them were migrants. Calderon said kidnappers working for the Zetas drug cartel were holding the men captive in the northern border city of Piedras Negras until their families paid a ransom. Soldiers found the men Saturday at a safe house guarded by three of the alleged kidnappers. Federal prosecutors say cartel workers intercepted the migrants outside a bus station in Piedras Negras and lured them to go with them by falsely offering to take them into the United States for charges ranging from $600 to $3,000. - Associated Press Venezuela          Opposition leader faces new obstacle Venezuela's Supreme Court threw into doubt the presidential campaign of a prominent opposition leader Monday by upholding a ban on his holding office. The Supreme Court ruled as ""impracticable"" a decision issued last month by the Costa Rica-based Inter-American Court of Human Rights that demanded that Venezuelan electoral officials allow Leopoldo Lopez to run for office. Lopez was on a list of politicians blacklisted because of corruption probes, but he insists he is innocent and notes that he was never sentenced in a court. The former Caracas district mayor was barred from holding office by Venezuela's top anti-corruption official starting in 2008. The temporary prohibition resulted from allegations that a nonprofit group that Lopez led had received donations from 1998 to 2001 from state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, where his mother worked. The comptroller general also sanctioned Lopez in 2004 for alleged irregularities in the movement of funds from one portion of his local budget to another. - Associated Press Judge chosen as Jordan's prime minister:King Abdullah II designated a well-known international judge as his prime minister Monday, a royal palace statement said, replacing a premier who ran afoul of reformers.

The Securities and Exchange Commission charged the three executives Friday with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act from 2003 through 2007. They are former chief executive Mark Jackson, former controller and head of internal audits Thomas O'Rourke, and James Ruehlen, who is the director and division manager of Noble's Nigerian subsidiary. O'Rourke settled the charges by agreeing to pay a $35,000 fine. He neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. Jackson and Ruehlen are disputing the charges. Noble, which has operations worldwide and an office in Sugar Land, Tex., was charged with criminal and civil foreign-bribery violations in November 2010 as part of what the government called a ""sweep"" of the oil services industry. The company cooperated with government investigators and wasn't prosecuted. It agreed to pay about $5.6 million in restitution and a $2.6 million criminal fine. The SEC's charges are the latest action in the government's efforts to combat overseas corruption in international business. A number of U.S. and foreign companies have been charged in recent years with violating the anti-corruption law, which makes it illegal to bribe foreign government officials or company executives to secure or retain business. In its lawsuit filed in Houston, the SEC said that Jackson and Ruehlen bribed Nigerian customs officials to process phony paperwork showing that Noble's oil rigs were moved in and out of the country even when they weren't. The purpose was to save the company substantial costs of exporting rigs from Nigeria and then re-importing them with new permits. O'Rourke helped approve the bribes and allowed the payments to be falsely recorded as legitimate operating expenses for Noble, according to the SEC. ""These executives knowingly authorized and paid foreign officials to process false documents, and they consciously concealed the scheme from Noble's audit committee,"" Gerald Hodgkins, an associate director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in a statement. Jackson's attorney, David Krakoff, called the SEC's allegations ""baseless."" He said the former Noble chief executive ""will vigorously defend himself in court, where the evidence will show what the SEC already knows, that at all times Mr. Jackson acted in good faith at Noble. ""He looks forward to clearing his good name in this proceeding,"" Krakoff said in a statement. F. Joseph Warin, an attorney representing Ruehlen, said it was his client who initially raised the issue within the company. Ruehlen ""fully cooperated throughout the investigation and always acted in an ethical and transparent manner,"" Warin's statement said. ""The claims against Mr. Ruehlen are wrong and they will be proven so at trial."" - Associated Press  Russia          Putin opponent winskey mayoral election An anti-corruption crusader has won a landslide victory in a mayoral election in a major Russian city, dealing a painful blow to the ruling party and energizing the beleaguered opposition. Yevgeny Urlashov won 70 percent of Sunday's vote in Yaroslavl, a city of about 590,000 some 150 miles east of Moscow, easily defeating the acting mayor, who was the candidate of president-elect Vladimir Putin's United Russia party. Urlashov's victory reflects growing public irritation with official corruption and social inequality. And it gives new hope to Russia's opposition, which has struggled to maintain momentum after Putin won a third presidential term last month. Opposition leaders have urged their supporters to focus on local elections, and Urlashov's victory is likely to bolster that strategy. Urlashov, a 45-year-old lawyer who was a member of the municipal council, won the race after a campaign heavily slanted in favor of his rival, who received blanket positive coverage from local television. Police also raided Urlashov's headquarters. - Associated Press Colombia          Guerrilla group frees 10 captives Colombia's main rebel group on Monday freed what it says were its last 10 military and police captives, returning the men to their families after at least 12 years spent in jungle prisons. The release of the six police officers and four soldiers highlighted efforts by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia to seek peace talks. It is Latin America's oldest and most potent guerrilla band, and it has been weakened by Colombia's U.S.-backed military. Flown to Bogota aboard a loaned Brazilian air force helicopter, the freed captives waved jubilantly. They were escorted from the helicopter by nurses to waiting relatives for reunions behind closed doors. Some jumped for joy on the runway. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC, had announced Monday's liberation on Feb. 26 in tandem with a halt in ransom kidnappings as a revenue source. - Associated Press Saudi Arabia          Girls may be allowedto play school sports Saudi Arabia is considering letting girls play sports at school, a senior education official was quoted as saying Monday, in what would represent a relaxation of rules governing women's lives in the conservative Islamic kingdom. Under Saudi Arabia's strict Islamic legal system, powerful clerics have issued religious rulings against female participation in sports. Women must receive the permission of a male ""guardian"" to travel abroad, work and have some elective surgery. They are also barred from driving. After King Abdullah moved last year to bring women into the country's political process, however, there have been some signs that authorities may allow sportswomen to compete internationally and make it easier for girls to exercise. - Reuters Mali          West African groupimposes sanctions The body representing West African nations on Monday imposed severe financial sanctions on Mali after a 72-hour deadline elapsed and soldiers who recently seized power in a coup failed to fully restore constitutional order. The Economic Community of West African States held an emergency meeting in the capital of Senegal on Monday. After the three-hour meeting, the chairman of the bloc, Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara, said the sanctions would go into effect immediately. They include the closing of the borders with Mali and the freezing of the nation's account in the regional central bank, measures that are likely to suffocate the economy of this poor and landlocked nation. Mali imports its petroleum products from neighboring Ivory Coast, and with the border closed, Mali is likely to run out of gasoline. It could also plunge the nation of more than 15 million into darkness, because the electricity grid is partially powered by diesel during the hot season, when hydropower is ineffective because of the low water table. - Associated Press Hungarian president quits after plagiarism report:Hungary's parliament has accepted the resignation of President Pal Schmitt, who announced that he was stepping down after losing his doctorate in a plagiarism scandal.

The U.S. Geological Survey said the 6.3-magnitude tremor was centered 108 miles from the tourist resort of Acapulco, not far from where a much more powerful earthquake struck last month. - From news services Turning spotlight on beacons for rights  As the sightseers round a corner in a chartered van, their tour guide recites facts about the capital city through a scratchy microphone. But these are no ordinary tourists. Salwa Bugaighis and Amira Yahyaoui, two of nine female activists from around the world being feted in Washington this week, are deep in conversation about feminism and its frustrations in the aftermath of their countries' revolutions. Household names in their homelands, the dissidents - Bugaighis, one of the first women on Libya's transitional council, who resigned to protest the role's tokenism, and Yahyaoui, 27, Tunisia's leading anti-censorship blogger - will be honored Wednesday night at the Kennedy Center by the Vital Voices Global Partnership. The event is sort of  like the Oscars, but for the world's toughest women's rights activists.          Along with six other female leaders, Bugaighis and Yahyaoui are on a Sunday evening bus tour of Washington attractions. The sightseeing is meant to get the honorees - who have heard about one another on blogs or through Facebook but have not met - out of hotel conference halls and give them a little bonding time. And it seems to be working. Fast friends, the visitors talk about how - despite the fact that women and men stood hand in hand during the Arab Spring protests - men sidelined the women almost immediately afterward. ""The question is how do we, as women, stand again?"" said Shatha al-Harazi, a 26-year-old reporter for the Yemen Times who overheard the women from Libya and Tunisia. Al-Harazi, who has braces, could be mistaken for a teenager. But she was summoned to the presidential palace after her tweets called attention to Yemen's human rights abuses. She said that President Ali Abdullah Saleh should resign. ""Since I was in the fifth grade, I have always been questioning things,"" Harazi said as the tour van rumbled along Embassy Row. ""But men always want women to be this decoration, like you are this remote control that they can turn on and off. It took so much courage for Salwa to resign. To meet her is like spending time with your role model."" This year's ceremony brings together many of the female leaders who emerged during the Arab Spring. It also includes Mexican anti-corruption politician Ruth Zavaleta Salgado and Liberian girl-soldier rehabilitator Rosana Schaack, who observed the need when she was working as a nurse during the country's civil war. It has been the kind of week when Samoan entrepreneur Adi Tafuna'i, who works with female farmers to sell the country's organic coconut oil to the Body Shop, could be seen discussing the power of women in business with Samar Minallah Khan, a documentary filmmaker from Pakistan who focuses on her country's discrimination against women. ""It does feel like a bit of girl bonding, but with superwomen, since each of the women have their own power and strength,"" said Khan, who brought her 14-year-old daughter, who removed her generation's omnipresent earbuds to take it all in. The women photograph a statue of Eleanor Roosevelt during a stop at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial. They say that they are amazed at how effectively the United States is able to market its short history and that their own countries should do a better job of honoring female leaders. Vital Voices was started in 1997 by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to identify and empower emerging female leaders. It has trained more than 12,000 women from more than 144 countries. Presenters at this year's 11th Annual Global Leadership Awards include such luminaries as Tina Brown, Mariane Pearl, Chelsea Clinton, Diane von Furstenberg, Claire Shipman and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.). The ceremony coincides with the release of ""Vital Voices: The Power of Women Leading Change Around the World,"" a book by Alyse Nelson, the group's president and chief executive. She tells the stories of the international female leaders she has spent time with during her two nearly decades with the organization, including Kenyan Rebecca Lolosoli, who runs Umoja, a women-only village for those fleeing abuse; Somaly Mam, a former sex worker in Cambodia who now helps women in the same situation; and Marina Pisklakova, who started Russia's first domestic violence hotline. The book reads like a global management guide, but one that draws its anecdotes from women who have been agents of social change in male-dominated societies.           During a stop at the Georgetown waterfront, Zavaleta - a Mexican politician and former speaker of the house of representatives who exposed widespread corruption within her party - encouraged Shaack to run for office. ""I really want to try,"" Shaack said, asking a slew of questions. The new friends also brainstormed about how to honor the one woman who couldn't make it to the ceremony to receive the organization's Global Trailblazer Award. Manal al-Sharif, 33, is a Saudi who was imprisoned after filming herself driving. She posted the video on YouTube and is now leading a national campaign to overturn the Saudi kingdom's ban on female drivers. She was scheduled to attend the event, but opted not to because she was concerned about her ability to leave and reenter the country without facing repercussions. (Sharif has been under increased pressure after a speech she gave last month at the Oslo Freedom Forum that was critical of the Saudi dictatorship.) ""We revolt twice as women in our societies,"" Harazi observed. ""But I know as a group we will find a way to give attention to her struggle. That's what this is all for."" waxe@washpost.com  israel          Officials: Sinai tanksviolate 1979 treaty Israeli officials said Tuesday that Egypt is violating the 1979 peace treaty between the two countries by deploying tanks in the demilitarized Sinai desert near the Israeli border. The officials said they have relayed their objections to the Egyptians directly and through American mediators. An Egyptian border official confirmed that his Israeli counterparts had voiced concerns. Egypt has been building up its military presence in the lawless area since Islamic militants attacked an army post there on Aug. 5 and killed 16 soldiers. Under the historic peace accord, Egypt was allowed to have only lightly armed policemen in the zone along the border with Israel. Limited numbers of tanks were permitted only in a zone on the far western side of the peninsula. Israel, which also views the Islamic militants as a threat, agreed last year to exceptions to the treaty allowing Egypt's military to deploy heavier weaponry in eastern Sinai close to the border. Egyptian troops moved in after the Aug. 5 attack, backed by armored personnel carriers and attack helicopters, in coordination with the Israelis. However, the Israeli officials alleged that the deployment of heavier M-60 battle tanks went further than agreed and that they should have been consulted. - Associated Press iran          Curbs on study by women draw rebuke A recent decision by Iran to ban women from studying dozens of subjects, including nuclear physics and oil engineering, threatens to wipe out one of the last vestiges of gender equality in the country, an exiled Nobel Peace laureate said. The Islamic republic's Science, Research and Technology Ministry has barred women at 36 universities from 77 fields of study, according to state-run media. Female students learned of the curbs when they received their registration letters in recent weeks. The new rules ""demonstrate that the Iranian authorities cannot tolerate women's presence in the public arena,"" Nobel peace laureate Shirin Ebadi wrote in an open letter to the United Nations dated Friday. ""They are trying to push women back to the private sphere of their homes so they may abandon their opposition and legitimate demands.""
