Under the African nation's proposals, according to conference participants, an official from the International Monetary Fund would take a key role in managing Zaire's central bank and another foreign official would supervise all outlays by the Finance Ministry. The plan was presented at the start of a two-day meeting between Zairian officals and representatives of 10 creditor nations and three international bodies.  Together, they exercise a crucial influence on the survival of President Mobutu Sese Seko's government. While the meeting was scheduled before the invasion by Katangan rebels a month ago, the overriding issue was whether Mobutu's government, and Western investments in the huge country, can be protected time and again from determined attackers - who President Carter has maintained are Cuban-trained. The creditor nations show little sympathy for Mobutu yet seem to be forced to save him to keep Zaire in the Western camp and capable of paying its debts. This mood of political frustration lends an air of unreality to the meeting, which is supposed to concentrate solely is financial issues affecting the potentially rich mineral-exporting nation. Lack of discipline in Zaire's central bank and inefficiency and corruption within the government have been major factors for the past few years in Western reluctance to extend still more credit and aid to a country whose debt is already said to total about $2.5 billion. The so-called ""Mobutu plan,"" and Zaire's economic woes, both go back some two years and are due in part to the sharp decline in world copper prices.  Copper provides about 70 percent of Zaire's export revenues, with cobalt the second major mineral export. The situation neared the brink of economic catastrophe following the invasion of mineral-rich Shaba province the secessionist rebels based in Angola.  The attack, although eventually driven off by French paratroopers, has shut down the mines for at least six months and driven away or left dead many of the Europeans who operate the mines . The meeting here is not designed to make decision on what to do about the economic plight but rather to hear the revised Zaire plan and achieve some sort of consensus about what can be recommended to the governments of the United States, Britian Belgium, France, West Germany, the Netherlands, Italy. Japan, Canada and Iran, as well as IMF, World Bank, and the executive committee of the European Common Market. The officials meeting here are trying to agree on recommendations for an initial $100 million to $120 million emergency aid program of food, medicine and humanitarian supplies over the next three months that was agreed in principle at a five-power meeting in Paris earlier this month. The Mobutu plan, however, could eventually cost a few billion dollars. Although the plan was not made public, Belgian officials said their fomer colony indicated its long-term investment needs through 1980 amount to about $1 billion.  Whether this would come from governmental or private sectors is now being discussed. Zaire, according to Belgian officials, already has unmet debt repayments projected at 2.2 billion between 1977 and 1980.  Some 40 percent of this is owned to private creditors. In addition to the investment program additional aid would be needed from international organizations. The key factor in whether the plan gains widespread supporty, however, is said to hinge upon the IMF granting new credits to Zaire.  In 1976-77 the IMF granted special standby credits totaling some $273 million. The Mobutu plan is said to propose major efforts to get the shattered mining industry back into production, attract foreign investors, revamp the public service, improve customs and import licensing services and democratize the country. Zaire has always had many Europeans in key advisory posts - especially Belgians, who have some $6 billion in vested there.  But the new plan envisions bringing in many others. The arrival of these foreign experts, Zairian delegate Bokana W'Ondangela said, ""doesn't mean we are coming back to colonialism - but simply into international cooperation.  We are turning to our friends and to international organizations for assistantce."""1-Jan-80,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (95%); RWANDA (93%); BURUNDI (92%); FRANCE (91%); UNITED STATES (79%); GERMANY (79%); ZAMBIA (79%); ANGOLA (79%); JAPAN (79%); BELGIUM (77%);","Around the northeastern Zairian town of Bukavu, a fertile highland area on the Rwanda-Burundi border, food crops are rotting in the fields because avaiation fuel is not available to fly it to other parts of the country. Because what remain of the thousands of miles of roads in Zaire at independence in 1960 are now mostly washed-out gulleys, ""trucks can't bring it out, either,"" the Zairian said. ""Farmers in that region smuggle coffee into Rwanda in exchange for gasoline,"" he said.  ""Each region does its own thing to survive."" Smugglers bring food into Lubumbashi from Zambia, Zaire's equally hard pressed southern neighbor.  In three years, the price of bread here has jumped from 25 cents a loaf to $1.50. Government corruption, exorbitant borrowing and mismanagement all have contributed to turning Zaire from prosperity a short five years ago into what is now considered among the world's worst economic ""basket cases."" Added to these ills was 1974's sharp drop in the price of copper -- Zaire's main foreign exchange earner -- from $1.40 to 60 cents a pound. Almost insolvent by 1976, Zaire ended up $5 billion in debt.  Today, Zaire must pay for nearly all its imports in foreign exchange prior to to delivery.  Few companies are willing to extend credit to the country. ""Fifty percent of this mess can be laid directly on the Zairians,"" said one Western source.  ""But I also blame the West for pouring loans in here when Zaire was doing well."" One-fifth, or $1 billion, of Zaire's debt is owed to international commercial banks who envisioned healthy returns on their loans when times were good.  The rest is owed to other governments and their agencies in the West. Anxious to keep the vital copper and cobalt mines in southern Shaba Province running, and to support the authoritarian but friendly government of President Mobutu Sese Seko against Communist inroads that have taken over neighboring governments in Angola and the Republic of the Congo, the West has found itself in the position of continuing to fund his corrupt regime and Zaire's downhill slide. Last November, the principal Western nations that aid Zaire -- including the United States, Belgium, France, West Germany, Britain and Japan -- met in Brussels and agreed to lend the country an additional $200 million in 1980.  In December, Zaire's creditors -- a group comprised primarily of the same nations -- pledged in Paris to reschedule hundreds of millions of dollars in debt over the next several years. A debate is raging in the international economic community on whether to ""turn off the spigot"" to Zaire, said a World Bank official here.  But so far creditors, despite Zaire' current $1.1 billion debt arrears, have put their confidence in the International Fund, which has attempted to take control of the administration of Zaire's economy. Mobutu ""realizes he must follow the IMF stabilization plan,"" one financial expert said, ""and allow their team to run the economy, or they pull out.  He doesn't have much breathing space."" As part of his agreement to the fund's plan in 1978, Mobutu had to accept a team of IMF-selected Western economic experts, headed by West German banker Erwin Blumenthal, to run the national bank.  ""A major part of that was to halt those who were dining at the trough,"" one expert said. Other international experts have ben brought in to run sections of the Ministry of Finance. The Fund's intercession came too late to stop Zaire's purchase of a now-deteriorating $18 million radio-television complex from France, or the recently opened $34 million People's Palace conference center from China. ""Zaire didn't need either one,"" a Western source said. Twenty-four percent of Zaire's public debt is tied to the construction of the economically wasteful 1,100-mile Inga-Shaba power line project.  When completed in 1983, the line will carry hydroelectric power from Zaire's coast down to Shaba for the copper industry. ""They just listened to incredibly bad advice on that project,"" said one informed source.  ""It'll be years before it pays for itself."" Almost immediately upon his arrival in August, 1978.  Blumenthal attacked the country's pervasive corruption at official levels, extending his reach to Mobutu's family and political entourage.  As principal director of Zaire's central bank, Blumenthal cut off all credit and foreign exchange to Mobutu's powerful and wealthy uncle, Litho Moboti, Fifty Zairian companies, owned by Mobutu's closest associates, were banned from doing any business with the bank until they paid long overdue loans previously ignored with impunity.  Most have paid up. Blumenthal and his team also put stringent controls on how foreign exchange earned from Zaire's copper and cobalt exports, the source of 70 percent of the country's revenue, would be distributed. Thirty percent of export earnings were kept by the bank to begin paving off the country's debst, two-thirds spent on food, medicines, spare parts and raw material imports for local industry, 2 percent on gasoline, and 5 percent on nonpriority items. Blumenthal also had to face down at least one Army general whose subordinates threatened him with physical harm unless the general was given some foreign exchange, according to a Western source: ""The general didn't get one penny, and he was later dismissed from the army. Blumenthal left in a huff last July, after completing 11 months of a year-long IMF contract, following a conflict with the Central Bank's Zairian governor, Emony Mondanga. ""Blumenthal was not a man to compromise,"" said a source who knows both men, ""and Emony does not suffer his power to be diluted.  Blumenthal said he was going to Germany for a vaction, and unles Emony was removed, he would not return."" Neither Mobutu nor the IMF backed Blumenthal's demand, another source said: ""He won many fights and lost some, including that one."" The Fund has since replaced Blumenthal with Mauritanian economist Mamadou Toure, who arrived in mid-October.  A full IMF investigation team will come during the last two weeks in January to check Zaire's compliance with Fund guidelines. When you ask 'whither Zaire?'"" said a U.S.-educated Zairian intellectual, ""you should be asking 'whither Mobutu?' As long as the West supports Mobutu,"" he continued bitterly, ""then this pit I call home will continue to go down."" In a country where an estimated 40 percent of government funds goes into the pockets of government officials, Mobutu has climbed the acquisition ladder from a salaried Army lieutenant general to become one of the world's wealthiest men. ""We're not talking about peanuts,"" said one expert on Zaire's trouble finances, ""We're talking about Mobutu's people using the Country's bank as their personal piggy bank to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars."" A Western official cited a study by Prof. Crawford Young of the University of Wisconsin that indicate irregular financial transactions involving coffee exports.  In 1977, Zaire exported about $540 million worth of coffee but only about $160 million were registered by Zaire's central bank. ""Clearly some funds go into foreign accounts,"" an American official said. Mobutu and his family control Celsa, a major coffee conglomerate in Zaire. The official also described as ""murky"" Zaire's diamond exports.  They are also controlled by the president. Despite IMF intervention, many here believe Zaire will never regain economic health as long as Mobutu remains in power. Direct rake-offs of government funds by Mobutu and his poltical cronies are reflected all the way down the line of authority to rank-and-file soldiers in the Zaire Army, many of whom extort civilians as a matter of practice.  But the Army, too, has its troubles.  Officers traditionally pocket the pay of their soldiers, and sell their good on the thriving black market. Smuggling, for those outside of Mobutu's family and personal patronage circle, is a hazardous endeavor, but many risk life and limb, ""sometimes just to get enough to eat,"" said one informed source. This year, Zaire will lose an estimated $40 million in coffee revenues and $60 million in diamond revenues to smugglers. In an effort to break out of a cycle of deepening poverty, Zaire's financial planners have put together a $1.8 billion economic reform and development proposal, characteristically called ""The Mobutu Plan,"" that they hope will be financed by the West over a three-year period. Kiakwama Kia Kiziki, the country's minister of economy, industry and commerce, argues that the plan is the only thing that can turn Zaire's economy around. But one informed source, waving copies of the foot-thick proposal, said the plan has no priorites, the financing is unrealistic, and Zaire ""can't absorb that amount of money over three years."" The West is ""not about to bail Zaire out"" with the plan, said one Western source familiar with the proposal. But Kiakwama, speaking in his plush, wood-panelled office, ended an interview on a note that has in the past brought last-minute help to Zaire. ""If there is no peace in Zaire,"" he said, ""there is no peace in Africa.  The West must help us now."" Most observers believe Zaire' principal hope for turning the economic tide that has flowed so strongly against it in recent years are its mineral reserves. Prices for both copper and cobalt have risen since 1976, with copper presently up to 90 cents a pound, and cobalt at $25 a ton to regular purchasers like the United States and $32 a ton on the mineral spot market. Cobalt prices, which were only $6 a ton a year ago, are in fact so high that transportation and gasoline-short Zaire has been flying the mineral out of Shaba instead of using its cheaper and only availabl rail route through South Africa. The increase in earnings has gradually pulled Zaire's growth rate from a minus 6 percent to about minus 1 percent today.  But the real possibility of a recession in the industrial West and Japan could set the country on an economic backslide. ""Any drop in demand or drop on [mineral] prices would hurt us,"" acknowledged Economy Minister Kiakwama. ""If prices remain as they are today, we think we can get out of negative growth by 1981.  If there is a recession in the United States and Europe -- remember our economy is based on what happens there -- then we will suffer,"" Kiakwama said. According to one Western source, ""If the mines at Kolwezi keep producing, if the world market is stable for a couple of years, and if there are no upheavals (in Shaba) like last year, then Zaire has a chance in the long run. ""I know,"" the source said.  ""Those are a lot of ifs."""28-Jun-80,GHANA (96%); AFRICA (79%);,"When Kwame Nkrumah brought Ghana to independence in 1957 as the first black African nation to break the colonial bonds, he and his country represented to the entire continent the euphoric promise of prosperity that freedom could bring. Today, Ghana's economy is in chaos, and the memory of the unfulfilled promise leaves bitter bile in the mouths of many of the country's 12 million citizens as they struggle dispiritedly for daily survival.  Many dream nostalgically of the return to the heady days of Nkrumah -- the ""redeemer"" they had at one time rejected. Saddled with a nine-month-old weak civilian government after years of military rule, Ghana's deepening difficulties follow a dreary pattern of many African nations' political and economic fortunes over the past 20 years.  Military coups and shortsighted economic planning have left a large number on weak footing. Hilla Limann, Ghana's newest civilian president, rode into office last year on a wave of Nkrumah nostalgia in the midst of a feverish, nationwide ""housecleaning"" ""by the have-nots against the haves."" But the exuberance of that period, initiated by a coup by junior officers that overthrew and executed the reportedly ""corrupt"" top officers of the previous military government, has been replaced by despondency as Ghana's economy continues to spiral downward and inflation erodes the average Ghanaian's dietary level. The retired leader of last year's coup, Flight Lt. Jerry J. Rawlings, has now been added to the Nkrumah shadow that overhangs the Limann government. ""There was a brief period [last year], after Rawlings took over, when things looked like they were going to get better,"" said Emmanuel Kwaku, ""but things are just getting worse.  It is harder and harder to survive."" ""This man Limann is not dynamic.  It is our own fault because we chose him.  We miss Nkrumah,"" continued Kwaku, who said he quit his 18-year job with the government-owned Daily Graphic printing company because he found he could earn more money hiring out his car. There is irony in the nostalgia for Nkrumah.  Ghana's deepening poverty began under his now fondly remembered rule and was exacerbated by pervasive corruption. Immediately after independence, Nkrumah shifted the country's then abundant resources to establishing an industrial base and virtually ignored Ghana's fertile potential for the development of agriculture. As the expensive industrialization plans began to fail and the production of Ghana's major revenue earner, cocoa, began to decline, the Army stepped in. Nkrumah's ouster was greeted by widespread rejoicing.  There followed a short-lived civilian government and three additional military coups. The most recent one, June 4, 1979, was led by disgruntled junior officers who said they had grown tired of seeing politicians, bureaucrats and high ranking officers enrich themselves while the average Ghanaian went to bed at night hungry. Led by Rawlings, the officers ruled through the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council.  The coup makers allowed previously scheduled elections to take place two weeks after they assumed power. The Revolutionary Council also ordered the executions of eight officers and officials, three of them former military heads of states, on charges of pilfering the nation's coffers.  They dubbed their rebellion ""the June 4 Revolution"" and ordered black market operators hoarding scarce goods to sell their wares at government-controlled prices. Hoaders were punished by public caning, and their houses were blown up.  Scores of Army officers and businessmen were jailed on charges of ""Kalabule,"" the Ghanaian term for all forms of profiteering. Prices soon dropped.  In a country where the average government employe earns $10 a day, the price of eggs plummeted overnight from 30 cents to 5 cents each. Rawlings handed over power in September to Limann, who won the elections. But he warned that the armed forces would not tolerate the pervasive corruption that had marked Ghana's former military and civilian Governments. Limann, 46, a politically unknown career diplomat before the elections, began his rule with the clumsy retirement of Rawlings, who reportedly heard his retirement announcement on his car radio. Since Limann's government has been in power, food prices have shot back up to higher levels than before Rawlings' revolution.  The black market rate for Ghana's legally inconvertable currency, the cedi, jumped from 15 to 20 to the dollar. Kenkey, the corn meal staple, is difficult to find in Accra and eggs are smuggled into neighboring Togo in exchange for hard currency. Rawlings, who remains extremely popular in Ghana, has grown increasingly critical of Limann's performance and charged that he has been the target of official harassment.  Three weeks ago on the anniversary of the June 4 coup, Rawlings held a symposium on the gains of the Revolutionary Council.  At the meeting in downtown Accra's community center, several thousand Ghanaians from all walks of life stood outside the packed center and loudly cheered whenever they heard Rawlings' voice from inside. ""This is a very fragile, frightened government that is always looking over its shoulder at Rawlings,"" said a Western observer.  ""They wish he'd just go away,"" said another source.  ""He's a catalyst for all the misery here."" In March, the government arrested 13 junior officers and one civilian on charges of plotting a coup.  Since then Accra has been rife with rumors of other arrests of coup plotters. ""There are still enlisted men who wish to conduct another coup,"" said a reliable source.  ""The political situation would be a lot better if Limann was seen as a strong president, but his government is very shaky."" Growing numbers of university professors, professionals and Ghanaians with marketable skills are leaving the country as soon as they can buy a passport on the black market. ""What is all this talk about brain drain and coup plots?"" asked Deputy Minister of Information James Ampah-Kwofie. Ghana has a democratically elected government and will not tolerate another military government, he said.  ""Civilian groups have vowed to fight against any new military government, and there is now an ongoing probe of the Army.  It is unfair to say this government is not doing anything."" Ampah-Kwofie reviewed with a reporter a spate of what he called negative stories about Ghana by American reporters.  ""We need understanding, not this,"" he said. ""The West should be encouraged to invest in Ghana. ""We know the economy is bad,"" he said.  ""My wife goes to queue up for food from three to six in the morning.  But it was in a shambles before we came into office and that was the military's doing."" One economist said that Ghana's main hope lies in the government rebuilding the agricultural base and revitalizing cocoa production.  Cocoa exports have dropped from a high of 500,000 tons annually in the 1950s to 265,000 tons last year. This year's crop is expected to rise to 300,000 tons but much of the benefit of that increase will be eaten up by steadily dropping world market prices for cocoa. Ghana lacks the foreign exchange to import insecticides, fertilizers, farm tools and machinery.  Domestic food production has declined.  Even gold production, Ghana's second largest revenue earner after cocoa, is low because of deteriorating machinery that cannot be replaced. Ghana's Central Bank has been severely restricting luxury imports to build up a reserve of foreign cash.  At one point last year, foreign exchange reserves amounted to only $67 million, enough for one month's imports.  The usual minimum margin is three month's reserves. The International Monetary Fund wants Limann's government to substantially devalue the cedi before it grants major economic assistance to Ghana.  The last two Ghanaian governments that devalued the cedi were overthrown. Information official Ampah-Kwofie expressed amazement at the IMF demand.  ""Do they realize the repercussions here in Ghana if we go through with this?"" he asked."20-Jan-81,LIBERIA (97%); UNITED STATES (94%); AFRICA (79%);,"It has been nine months since 17 noncommissioned officers in the Liberian Army rose up from their tumbledown, tin-on-tin barracks on a beach below the Executive Mansion here, shot and bayoneted President William R. Tolbert Jr., and took over the Government without half a notion of how to run a country. ''If it weren't for the bloodshed and the enormous economic problems,'' Amos Dawson, the dean of Liberia College, said the other day, ''you could characterize a lot of what has happened as amusing.'' Moreover, said a high civilian official in the new revolutionary Government, ''to cope, you have to regard a lot of what goes on as comedic.'' The man who became Liberia's leader after the coup, the 20th head of state this country has had since it was founded by freed American slaves in 1847, is Master Sgt. Samuel Kanyon Doe, an 11th-grade dropout who was trained two years ago by a United States special forces unit. He became Liberia's chief executive on April 12, 1980, not because he aspired to the job, but merely because he was the ranking officer involved in Mr. Tolbert's assassination. Master Sergeant Doe, seven lower ranking sergeants, eight corporals and two privates became the Government of Liberia, known as the People's Redemption Council. Corruption Under Tolbert Alleged The soldiers gave as their reasons for the coup more than a century of domination by the descendants of the freed American slaves who set up Africa's oldest republic, corruption by the Tolbert Government and economic deprivation of the 1.8 million Liberians at the hands of the 90,000 ''Americo-Liberians.'' Sergeant Doe increased the pay of the lowest ranking soldiers from $75 to $250 a month and also gave raises to higher paid officers and to civil servants. He promised to hold down the price of gasoline and rice, a staple. Almost a year to the day before the coup, there had been bloody riots here over an increase in the price of rice. The 28-year-old, modest new head of state eschewed his predecessor's West German limousine, first in favor of a Chevrolet and later a Honda Civic. His illiterate wife, Nancy, the mother of his two children, started bringing home-cooked, hot lunches to his office. The learning process began. First the soldiers, most of them in their 20's, learned that the Government had $5 million in the central bank and that it owed $700 million in foreign debts. A former Finance Minister under President Tolbert, an adviser to the revolutionary Government before leaving to live in the United States, endeavored to explain delicately to the sergeant that he had to raise the price of gasoline. An Incentive for the Soccer Team Initially, Sergeant Doe held to his promise to freeze prices.  Exasperated, the financial adviser finally blurted, ''You don't sign this paper, country go blooey.'' The sergeant signed. Gasoline prices have doubled, to $2.80 a gallon. For a while it seemed to Liberia's educated elite that the country was being run by the ''Keystone Kops.'' The head of state threatened the national soccer team with imprisonment if it did not win a match with Gambia. The match ended in a tie. About 700 civil servants were jailed, but most were freed within a few days and charged $8.50 for each day of their incarceration, $3.50 for a light bulb and $5 for water. Corporals used their guns instead of their tongues to resolve arguments. A vast though undisclosed number of skilled Liberians emigrated. Fancy Houses Taken Over The military took over many of Monrovia's fancy houses. They took the screens off the windows of the house that had belonged to former Foreign Minister Charles Cecil Dennis Jr., who had been executed. The next-door neighbor asked why. ''To let the chickens in, of course,'' a corporal said. The People's Redemption Council wrecked so many cars that it had to impose a rule on itself: Wreck one and the Government buys you a replacement; wreck two and you buy your own. Ever so slowly, though, the Redemption Council appears to be learning how to govern. ''They have learned what they don't know,'' said a bank manager who asked that his name and his nationality not be disclosed. Diplomats say that Sergeant Doe has become much more aware of his responsibilities, that he is asserting himself more and that he has cut back the instances in which soldiers get out of line. Moreover, Western diplomats say, the sergeant himself at last has a grasp of how tenuous Liberia's economy is, though not much of an idea of how to stabilize it beyond seeking loans. Iron Ore and Rubber Revenues The country's monthly revenue, mostly from iron ore and rubber, is about $17 million. Its monthly expenditures are about $30 million, including $7 million in debt repayments. Last month, Liberia barely avoided bankruptcy with a hastily assembled American emergency grant of $7 million. This month, four foreign banks managed to put together a $4 million loan to get the Government over the hump. An official in the American Embassy here calls it putting Band-Aids on hemorrhages. To his credit, Sergeant Doe has taken some steps that have brought him a degree of confidence from international bankers. He has told Government agencies that they cannot ask for another dime for the time being. Announcing that ''our policy shall be to repair rather than to replace,'' he has stopped the purchase of any new equipment. He has also frozen Government hiring. This month the Government will start taking deductions for mandatory national savings bonds from all salaried employees. The bonds are expected to raise a quick $50 million. They are to be paid back to the employees, with interest, in five years. The policies helped persuade the International Monetary Fund to provide Liberia with $85 million toward this year's budget of $372.5 million. Sergeant Doe reportedly says that he would like nothing better than to return Liberia to civilian rule, but that he wants to pull the country out of its economic mess first. Civilians capable of running a government say they are not all that anxious to assume the headaches now anyway. And before the army can return to the barracks, they must have new barracks. Conditions in the present ones had a great deal to do with the killing of President Tolbert. 'We Are Not Nincompoops' ''I want you to talk to the master sergeant,'' George Boley, executive assistant to the head of state, said to an American correspondent recently. ''I want you to see we are not nincompoops.  And I want you to see the barracks. The reason the soldiers are in town is they don't want to be in the barracks. No water at all or muddy water. Their children have diarrhea all the time.'' As it turned out, Sergeant Doe had a cold. When a journalist got into his office, tape recorder in hand, the sergeant said: ''Cut the tape. Cut it.'' Then he explained that he would like to chat for two hours, but felt too ill to talk for one minute. The interview was over."16-Mar-81,NIGER (99%); AFRICA (97%); CENTRAL AFRICA (92%);,"The devastating Sahelian drought and pervasive civilian corruption provided the pretext for the bloody Army coup that brought a military government to power here seven years ago.Yet, perhaps uniquely for Africa, Niger's severe military government has achieved what it announced it had taken power to accomplish -- self-sufficiency in food and an end to mass starvation. Situated in Central Africa's semi-arid Sahelian belt, Niger will always be at the mercy of the weather's vagaries, but since 1974 it has plowed its meager resources and what foreign aid it has received into increasing production of staple grains with such intensity that the country may achieve a level of production that exceeds its 2.7 percent annual population growth rate. lThat would be a first for contemporary Africa. Officials in African countries, many of which were self-sufficient in food before independence, have become alarmed in recent years by the ever-increasing amounts of scarce foreign exchange their countries spend on imported foodstuffs. Africa's estimated population of 400 million is increasing on a yearly average of 3 percent while food production, where it is not declining, is increasing at a rate far below the birth rate.  Despite huge outlays in foreign assistance and grandoise agricultural schemes, most African countries have not been able to reverse this trend.The one exception is Niger. ""For the past three years,"" said the director for the U.S. Agency for International Development in Niger, Jay Johnson, ""Niger is the only Sahelian country out of the total of eight that has not needed and emergency food"" donations. ""And it appears now that food production in Niger is exceeding population growth,"" Johnson added. Niger's austere military ruler, Col. Seyni Kountche, took power from what many neutral observers have characterized as a corrupt and mismanaged elected civilian government that had exacerbated the painful problems the country of 5.5 billion suffered during the 1968-1974 Sahelian drought. Hamani Diori, the ousted president who had headed the country since independence from France in 1960, was imprisoned in the French-built Zinder fortress east of here until last April.  He lives today in a villa here in the capital, where he receives visitors and family but remains under guard.  His wife along with about 100 other people, was killed reportedly with a gun in her hand defending Diori against the coup makers. Kountche's stern government keeps a tight rein on the spending of the country's $336 million annual budget in contrast to Diori's government.  Last August, for example, Boubakar Abdou Adamu, former civilian secretary general to Kountche's government, was charged with siphoning funds into his own pocket by double invoicing government purchases with the aid of a local French businessman. Both Adamu and the Frenchman are now in jail awaiting an as yet unscheduled trial.  Following their arrests, the ascetic Kountche ordered a massive two-month audit of all government offices. ""Not much else was done around here until that audit was completed,"" said a Western observer, ""and you could almost feel a collective sign of relief when everyone else came up clean.  Kountche runs a very tight ship."" ""Kountche's government is an authoritarian regime that acts arbitrarily and doesn't follow Western concepts of judicial procedure, for example, but his government does not treat people unfairly,"" added another Western observer. Niger is fortunate in having large amounts of uranium in its northern desert regions around the town of Arlit.  Earnings from uranium exports, which doubled to 400,000 tons a year in the past two years, have, in part, fueled the country's successful program of stepping up food production.  The country may face some tighter economic measures in the near future, however, since the world market price of uranium dropped from $46 a pound last year to the current price of $32 a pound. The plunge in uranium earnings, 75 percent of Niger's revenue, may lead to a severe cutback in a number of expensive development projects and a money crunch in the mid-1980s when a number of the large loans come due.  Presently the world's fourth producer of uranium after the United States, Canada and the combined exports of South Africa and Namibia (South West Africa), Niger may soon face stiff marketing competition from Australia as that country increases its production. Although the government refers to itself officially as provisional, there have been no signs that Kountche plans to allow a return to civilian government in the near future.  His government has recently appointed a commission to study the creation of a grass-roots organization, called Development Society, that theoretically will allow some broad-based participation in the formation of government policies. Observers and Nigerriens are anxiously awaiting the commission's recommendations, due by January of next year, as the Development Society is supposed to serve as a vehicle for modernization, maintain the political status quo and not disrupt the traditional lifestyles and values of the peasants, who make up 90 percent of the population. ""That is a very tall order,"" said one observer.  ""What I think it amounts to is this government is suffering from a complex because it does not have a mandate to rule,"" he added.  ""Kountche is very respected by the Nigeriens but he it not popular."" Asked in an interview why there has not been a move back toward civilian government if his government is indeed provisional, Kountche referred to his country's poverty and lack of a sense of national identity. ""We cannot make the hungry man a democrat,"" said Kountche.  ""In Niger, our primary needs are food, housing, education, health and being clothed.  Second, we have become a nation very recently, 20 years ago,"" with still divided and possibly disruptive ethnic groups. The Development Society's ""whole consequence would be to prepare for final and real democracy in Niger,"" Kountche said. On Niger's growing economic difficulties, Kountche said his government will keep expenditures and overseas borrowing as tight as possible keeping in mind the government's food production priorities.  ""This is an effort without a price tag for us,"" he said. ""We'll take the necessary measures to avoid becoming the slaves of the International Monetary Fund,"" said Kountche. Last year, Niger's peasants produced 1.7 million tons of grain, mostly sorghum and millet, or 200,000 tons more than the country's annual needs.  ""Each year [since the end of the drought] we're getting increases and the farmers are building up their stocks,"" said AID official Johnson. ""We are a proud people,"" said Kountche.  ""There were many heads of families who were really humiliated [during the drought] by this [food donation] process because they had to ask for their day-to-day food."" For now, he concluded, ""as long as their is good rainfall in Niger, we are not going to ask for food."""18-Aug-81,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (95%); AFRICA (79%);","The newspapers usually carry a frontpage picture of him and an item about what the Guide is doing.  His portrait hangs in every office, invariably depicting him wearing a leopardskin cap and holding a carved swagger stick - two articles that have become the symbols of his power. Sometimes his aides wear enameled badges bearing his portrait in the lapels of suits modeled on the presidential mode of dress. His voice comes over the radio, reciting slogans like an incantation. The Guide is Mobutu Sese Seko, founding president of the Popular Movement of the Revolution, President of Zaire and Father of the Nation, to use some of the official titles. Personality Cult Fades Somewhat The personality cult surrounding him has faded somewhat in recent years; the television news, for instance, no longer depicts him descending in carts from heaven. But his presence and power remain pervasive. At birth, every Zairian automatically becomes a member of the Popular Movement of the Revolution. The party is supreme, its various institutions placed ahead of Parliament, the Government and the Supreme Court. General Mobutu is the unshakeable head of the party, which is the only one in the country. His power flows in other ways too. Nguza Karl-i-Bond, a former Prime Minister who fled to exile in Brussels recently, has publicly accused President Mobutu of skimming off millions from the central bank. A Western economist who has been in Zaire for six years and who asked not to be identified said: ''Foreign exchange is political power here. As long as we can keep on using it as patronage, we exercise supreme power over the chosen few.'' The country's Roman Catholic bishops have openly condemned the ''corruption'' of President Mobutu's regime, which began in 1965 with a coup and which has survived many challenges, including one of Africa's worst economic crises and two invasions by dissidents in the southern part of the country. 'He Knows Where to Stay Safe' ''Mobutu is a survivor,'' a Western diplomat said. A Zairian baggage porter, who lives in one of the slums surrounding Kinshasha, agreed with that assessment after a fashion: ''He knows where to stay safe. He does not come here. He is afraid of the people.'' That claim does not ring entirely true for, during a visit to Kolwezi, at the heart of the copper-mining province of Shaba Province in the south recently, President Mobutu toured the cracked streets and poor homes where most Zairians live. ''The people went out and waved,'' a taxi driver said. ''We had to. Each street has its representatives on the party and they came round and told us to come out to cheer. ''But did he see the pain and the suffering here?'' the driver said. ''I don't think so.'' Like all of those critical of President Mobutu, he requested anonymity. President Mobutu's rules have been erratic, but some positions seem constant. Head of a nation that produces cobalt, copper and industrial diamonds, the President has won Western, Chinese and other support by playing up the consequences of a possible Soviet takeover here. In 1977, Morocco helped him repulse rebels in Shaba, the former Katanga Province; in 1978 the French Foreign Legion did the same for him, and today, French, Belgium and Chinese instructors are training his army. Need of Outside Support Cited ''If the West, the United States in particular, dropped him, he would fall,'' said a missionary who has been in Zaire, the former Belgian Congo, for 24 years. ''It is outside support that keeps him where he is.'' Another constant has been a kind of pragmatism, an aide to the President said. General Mobutu has embarked on policies, like a nationalization program in 1972, that proved disastrous. When production plummeted and the disaster became all too apparent, after the foreigners who had been running the nation's agriculture, business and industry had all been obliged to hand over their jobs to Zairians, President Mobutu reversed the policy. Similarly, when the full depth of Zaire's economic crisis - caused by a drop in the copper price in 1974 and 1975, and other maladies - became obvious, President Mobutu, at some political risk, accepted stringent guidelines imposed by the International Monetary Fund, including a string of devaluations. The value of the zaire, the nation's currency, is a seventh of what it was in 1978 and poverty is widespread. ''It may take time, but when he realizes what's wrong he does something about it within the limits of the possible,'' an African diplomat said. A Western diplomat commented that the limit of the possible seemed to be the outer fringes of the loyalist coterie around the autocratic President. No New Prisons Built President Mobutu boasts that since his country, then called the Democratic Republic of the Congo, became independent in 1960, not a single new prison has been built. All the same, the President's human rights record has been criticized in the West, particularly by the Carter Administration.  Authoritative sources say that General Mobutu's secret police remain active. The army, too, has been a pillar of President Mobutu's regime.  Troops are currently guarding strategic sites in central Kinshasa in case of political unrest, military sources said, and the army has been used against students, strikers and dissidents in recent years. Despite the complaints against President Mobutu, many Western analysts believe that without him Zaire would revert to the anarchy that prevailed in the five years after the country's independence before the general took power. His policies over the years, Western diplomats said, have insured that there is no figure of any stature to replace him, and if he should be removed from the political scene, these analysts anticipate a scramble for power that could embroil the nation's 250 tribes against one another in a re-enactment of earlier bloodshed. Some Residual Support Seen According to this argument, President Mobutu has given Zaire's 29 million people a measure of peace and unity that they did not have in the early 1960's. This means that he still has some residual support among people who would rather put up with whatever the present brings than revert to conditions of the past. An enigma that strikes many Western analysts visiting or living in Zaire is why the people appear to tolerate conditions that clearly should produce deep discontent. Peasants in the countryside, for instance, are obliged to hand out their earnings to soldiers and government officials, even after paying official taxes. Even the President himself has denounced some of his own followers for corruption that he has called ''le mal Zairois,'' or the Zairian illness. The autocratic President is now hoping that with the change of Administration in Washington, he will receive a sympathetic hearing from President Reagan, and, Western diplomats said, he has already been encouraged by signals from Washington indicating that longtime allies of the United States, like Zaire, will be supported."18-Aug-81,LIBERIA (94%); AFRICA (92%); GHANA (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%); NIGER (79%);,"It is a measure of Master Sgt. Samuel K. Doe's continuing popularity that street crowds applauded spontaneously as he passed by recently in a custom-built Mercedes Benz limousine immediately after announcing a 20 percent price increase in rice -- their daily staple. A little more than two years ago, a similar governmental proposal unleashed violent ""rice riots"" by street crowds. Twelve turbulent months later, the president, William Tolbert, was ousted in one of contemporary Africa's bloodiest military coups and replaced by Doe as head of state. Last month, under pressure from the International Monetary Fund and U.S. State Department, Doe lifted the years-old subsidy of rice prices, pushing the price from $20 up to $24 per 100-pound bag, and substantially raised taxes in an effort to halt Liberia's slow economic deterioration and reduce the government's large annual cash deficit. Yet significantly for this small West African country's future, the official corruption and extravagance that Doe and the other coup-makers had promised to eradicate have crept back into the same prominent roles they held under the Tolbert government. Elsewhere in Africa, the fiscal management records of the many military governments over two decades of independence have varied widely from the fiscally conservative, almost corruption-free military government of Niger to the venality of Ghana's former military leadership. There is some hope for sound financial policies under Doe's government, economic analysts said, but there are also some disturbing warning signs. In his July 17 speech announcing the end to the $9 million yearly government rice subsidy, Doe also outlined additional emergency measures that will add from 2 to 10 percent to personal income tax bills for Liberia's salaried work force of 71,000, boosted the gasoline tax by 20 cents to $3 a gallon and launched a modest $615 million four-year development plan. ""The fact must not be hidden that our economic and financial condition remains grave,"" said Doe in his 40-minute speech. ""As your leaders, we, the members of the People's Redemption Council have had to make some difficult choices among unpleasant and difficult alternatives."" But the Redemption Council is beginning to be the focus of growing domestic disgruntlement, most of which is still publicly muted, due to the reappearance among Army officers and some high-level civilians of blatant bribe-taking, high living, ethnic favoritism that could be a harbinger of tribal conflicts and the shifting of a heavier than necessary tax load onto Liberia's taxpayers to ensure the comfort of the new government leaders. Identical complaints were given as justifications for the overthrow of Tolbert's government. While much of Liberia's present financial difficulties were inherited from the Tolbert government, the country's previous high credit rating -- attributable to a 13-decade history of political stability -- was wiped out with the coup. Diplomatic and financial analysts here believe that Doe has yet to bring under firm control the other soldiers on the ruling Redemption Council. Five council members were executed last week after being accused of plotting against Doe. In addition, soldiers, and some imposters, have continued to extort and harass local businessmen since the early days of the coup. Chase Manhattan Bank's outgoing branch manager here, Ian Hodge, recently raised some of these issues in two farewell speeches. Hodge represented Chase here for five years and, although his talks were covered by local reporters, none of his criticism of the Redemption Council or Doe appeared in the government-run media. ""It is somewhat disturbing to note the apparent increase in the harassment of various business leaders by Redemption Council members,"" Hodge said at one point. ""The coup not only resulted in a new government, but also toppled the dominant so-called Americo-Liberians descendants of the 19th century American blacks who founded the country as the privileged and monied class within Liberia,"" Hodge said. ""A direct result has been an increase in tribal importance which has resulted in tribal friction, as the Krahn tribe of Sgt. Doe has obtained a massive amount of government largesse despite its relatively small size."" Sixteen tribes make up Liberia's 1.8 million population. One government official, who declined to be identified, acknowledged that ""corruption has returned and is going on on a wider scale"" than previously. ""The difference is that the total dollar amounts are smaller and it reaches down all the way to the small man in the street, whereas, it only benefited the top-level officials"" in Tolbert's government, he added. ""We're calling it a redistribution of the wealth."" Since the mid-1970s, Liberia has been suffering from a drop in world prices for two of its major exports, iron ore and rubber. The Tolbert government borrowed heavily overseas and saddled the country, which has an average annual budget of $250 million, with a $700 million debt. With support from the IMF, Doe's government has been able to reschedule a large amount of the debt repayment. The IMF insisted, however, that austerity measures be taken to reduce the government's $100 million deficit of last year to less than $75 million this year before it would grant Liberia $65 million in special drawing rights. The U.S. Embassy here notified Doe's government that unless it fulfilled IMF requirements the second half of a $25 million economic support grant would not be released. By ending the rice subsidy, raising income taxes and the tax on gasoline, Doe met most of the IMF demands. The rice subsidy alone, besides draining meager government resources, fueled massive smuggling of the cheaper Liberian rice across its borders into Sierra Leone, Guinea and the Ivory Coast. In his speech, Doe said he has also ordered an extensive reform of customs duty collection at Monrovia's port, which was described by a banking official as ""the most corrupt operation in Liberia."" Major problems remain. Individual members of the Redemption Council, for example, have allotted up to 12 cars for their personal use from government fleets. Anyone traveling on government business can claim $400 a day in expenses even if another government or international agency is paying the tab. In its first eight months in power last year, Doe's government had spent more than double the $600,000 a year that Tolbert's government budgeted for travel expenses. The recently failed Bank of Liberia was closed in March, but soldiers, implementing liquidation procedures, are collecting the debts in cash without receipts, according to particularly well-informed financial sources. The government's central bank, which already has to make good on a $21 million overdraft from the Bank of Liberia, ""will probably also have to repay the depositors their $10 million,"" said one source. ""This is money Liberia doesn't have."" For more than a year, the IMF has been trying without success to get Doe and the Redemption Council to agree to sell the 737 Boeing presidential jet they inherited from the Tolbert government. The annual debt payment on the plane ""is $2.2 million and if they sold it today, this government would realize a profit of $7 million,"" said a foreign financial source. ""But they prefer to have the plane available for their personal use,"" he added. To keep the plane and still meet IMF demands on reducing government expenditures, the 5 percent austerity income tax that IMF representatives recommended be applied across the board was implemented on a graduated basis with the higher paid of Liberia's workers taxed as much as 10 percent more. Patrick Seyon, vice president of the University of Liberia who has studied the country's economy, sadly shook his head when asked for a reaction to the income tax increases the day after they were announced. ""People are saying that the taxes fall too heavily on the wage earners and not on the market women or the Lebanese merchants here,"" Seyon said. ""They joke that they might as well quit their jobs and go into small-time trading in order to survive."""22-Aug-81,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (96%); AFRICA (79%); SUDAN (79%);","The Westerners who monitor Zaire's broken economy are, for the first time in years, displaying a glimmer of satisfaction about this vast and turbulent nation's handling of its economic affairs. What optimism there is, however, is hedged with caveats: In the view of one of those experts, the measures taken so far to ease Zaire's protracted economic crisis may prove to be no more than ''a way of putting off the day of reckoning.'' The manifestations of economic malaise are diverse in this Western-supported nation, which extends from the Atlantic seaboard to the heart of Africa, encompassing vast potential wealth from minerals and oil. Smuggling Impoverishes Nation Across the river from here, for example, is Brazzaville, capital of Congo, which is registered in diamond-trading circles as an official exporter. But, Western diplomats say, it does not have any diamond mines: The stones it exports are smuggled from Zaire. Similarly, people are working industriously in the eastern Kivu Province on the coffee crop, travelers report, and working with equal zest on shipping up to half the beans clandestinely through the Sudan. Then, economic experts say, coffee earnings that should be repatriated through the central bank are kept outside Zaire because it is unprofitable to bring the foreign exchange back into the country and convert it into zaires at the official rate of 5.56 to the dollar. The Government of President Mobutu Sese Seko has effectively acknowledged the currency black market by allowing businessmen to import goods without divulging the source of their dollars, Swiss francs or West German marks. Thus the diamond and coffee money goes out and is used to buy consumer goods abroad. These goods then come into Zaire, where they are sold for prices that reflect the black market rate of about 11 zaires to the dollar. The wealthy can buy a home freezer on Kinshasa's dusty sidewalks for 5,500 zaires. 'Black Money' Helps Economy ''This is important,'' one economist said. ''Last year Zaire recorded its first growth in years - 1.8 percent. The reason was that goods could be imported with black money, and the economy grew.'' The International Monetary Fund is the main international agency supervising Zaire's attempts to recover from economic woes.  The causes of these problems are diverse: a fall in the price of copper, its main foreign exchange earner, in 1974-75; agricultural neglect; a program of nationalization, or ''Zairianization,'' that was set up in 1972 and crippled production, and a seemingly endemic corruption. At the fund's behest, Zaire has devalued its currency (the zaire is now worth one-seventh of what it was in 1978), put a brake on Government spending, increased its tax revenues by tightening up on collection procedures (largely by installing Belgian customs officers at the main ports) and lifted some price controls. Favorable Report by I.M.F. These measures, and a perceived new readiness by Zairian officials to tackle their problems with politically unpopular remedies, prompted the I.M.F. to assess Zaire's performance in 1980 as generally positive and satisfactory. At the same time, the fund said in a recent study, fiscal measures have ''introduced a welcome element of flexibility and liberalism in the economy.'' Accordingly, the fund asserted, Zaire's effort toward economic recovery ''merits strong internal and external support.'' That support was demonstrated at two recent events.  On June 22, the I.M.F. decided to extend a three-year credit worth about $1.2 billion to Zaire, the biggest such loan in sub-Saharan Africa. And on July 8, the so-called Paris Club of Zaire's creditor nations agreed to reschedule $370 million of the $790 million in payments this year that Zaire owes on its foreign debts of more than $4.5 billion. Support Attributed to U.S. According to one senior diplomat, the United States is canvassing support for Zaire's economic recovery. A recent confidential assessment by Washington said that President Mobutu's Government had demonstrated the political will to embark on a three-year revival program that would cost 7 billion zaires, in addition to I.M.F. support. The assessment also recommended strong United States support for the rescheduling of this year's debt. The study argued that additional American aid would be needed if more expensive rescue operations later were to be avoided. But, like most other Western assessments, it stressed that Zaire's performance in striving for recovery would have to be monitored rigorously. One economist from a nonaligned country said there was little benevolence in the West's attitude toward Zaire.  ''When someone owes you as much as Zaire owes, you have to keep them afloat so they can pay you back,'' the economist said. Moreover, he argued, Western support for President Mobutu had heavy political overtones, since his country provided minerals such as copper and cobalt, its principal foreign exchange earners, to which the West wanted continued access. I.M.F.'s Long-Term View The I.M.F., in its study, said: ''Despite the recent progress, Zaire still faces enormous economic and financial difficulties'' stemming from its debt burden, a legacy of problems stemming from ''inappropriate policies'' and the decline in the market value of its minerals. Some of these difficulties are all too apparent.  Zaire spends $200 million to $400 million a year on food imports, half from South Africa, half from Western Europe, while only a fraction of its agricultural land is being cultivated. The gap between rich and poor is wide, and while inflation is down from a high of 100 percent a year, it remains at an estimated 50 percent. Much of the country's commerce, one economic expert said, runs on a ''parallel market'' that invites corruption among businessmen, Government officials and the military. The manufacturing sector is working at 30 percent of capacity because of a lack of imported raw materials and spares.  Bomboko Lokumba, Zaire's Foreign Affairs Minister, said recently that his country's aims were to increase imports in order to increase production, and to reduce state spending, tighten controls on foreign exchange allocations, cut the budget deficit and work with the I.M.F. The minister told Zaire's creditors that outside help was needed, and said his compatriots were ''confronted every day with difficulties and constraints that it is sometimes difficult for you to understand from impersonal tables and graphs.''"3-Jan-82,GHANA (95%); LIBYAN ARAB JAMAHIRIYA (79%); NIGERIA (79%);,"Ghana's military officers have been itching to get back into the presidential castle ever since international pressure cut short the 90-day rule of Flight Lieut. Jerry J. Rawlings in 1979. Last week, in the fourth coup attempt in two years, Mr. Rawlings again seized the Government radio station, promised to ''clean up corruption'' and pledged ''that nothing will be done from the castl e, whether by God or the devil, without the consent and the aut hority of the people.'' There was plenty to clean up. Despite triple-digit inflation and a sharp drop in production of cocoa, Ghana's main export earner, President Hilla Limann hasn't accepted foreigners' conditions for a $1 billion loan under International Monetary Fund auspices. The bailout was tied to devaluation of Ghana's virtually valueless currency, the cedi; but the last devaluation led to Lieutenant Rawlings's 1979 coup. Afterward, he ordered the execution of the chief of state, Lieut. Gen. Frederick W.K. Akuffo, two other former military rulers and five other persons. All were accused of corruption. Parliament has been investigating President Limann's top aides, including an official of the ruling People's National Party said to have taken a $5 million payoff from a British banknote printing company. Two years ago, after neighboring Nigeria cut off Ghana's oil, Lieutenant Rawlings was forced to permit elections. The winner, President Limann, retired Mr. Rawlings from the Air Force and accused him of plotting subversion with funds from Libya, where he is a frequent guest of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. Perhaps recalling his own executive style, Mr. Rawlings said on New Year's Eve that he was ''prepared at this moment to face a firing squad if what I try to do for the second time in my life does not meet the approval of Ghanaians.''"17-Feb-82,GHANA (99%); AFRICA (92%); LIBYAN ARAB JAMAHIRIYA (79%);   LIBYA (79%);,"After a disruptive 25-year history of five Army coups, Ghana has retaken the leftist path with a coup-installed ""revolutionary people's government"" whose leaders predict they will reverse the society's moral decay, provide a stable democracy and restore economic health to a country on the edge of financial collapse. The six-week-old government's leftist swerve has pushed beyond the socialist visions of the late Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana's first president, and borrowed from Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi's eclectic model of ""direct democracy"" through ""popular committees"" that theoretically will manage all aspects of the lives of Ghana's 14 million people. The world's former leading cocoa exporter with a still-untapped agricultural potential, Ghana has been dragged down steadily from a relative position of affluence at independence in 1957 to virtual bankruptcy today by the visionary economic planning and venality of successive civilian and military governments. Revelations in November of widespread corruption in the two-year-old elected government of president Hilla Limann were a major factor in the acceptance by Ghanaian civilians of the bloody coup on Dec. 31 that overthrew him, according to Western and Ghanaian sources. The coup was carried out by a small band of former Ghanaian Army men led by Air Force Flight Lt. Jerry J. Rawlings. Most of the disgruntled regular Army joined in. ""I ask for nothing less than a revolution, something that will transform the social and economic order of this country,"" Rawlings said in a radio broadcast the morning of his takeover. ""Let the world know that Ghanaians are determined to make democracy really work for the ordinary man, not just for a small group of people to exploit them and ride over their misery,"" he said later. The 34-year-old Rawlings, an open admirer of Qaddafi, is not unlike other African leaders who started out to create political systems that would eradicate elitist privilege and guarantee an equitable distribution of national income. Numbers of like-minded African leaders, however, have presided over governments that degenerated into totalitarian regimes. It is too early to predict where Ghana's revolution will end, but early signs have been mixed. Besides being corrupt, the Limann government proved weak in its efforts to pull Ghana out of a severe economic decline. A black market flourished for the overvalued Ghana cedi and inflation was as high as 125 percent. A government effort to revive food and cash crop production was a total failure. Limann's officials also balked at the stringent conditions set by the International Monetary Fund to accompany its offer of a $1.4 billion recovery program. By contrast, the ruling seven-man provisional National Defense Council, which Rawlings heads, has maintained momentum in a series of key moves including sending student volunteers to the countryside to help move the cocoa crop to the port of Tema. For the past two years, a good portion of the crop stayed on planters' farms because of bad roads or lack of transport. Last week there were long lines of Ghanaians outside banks turning in their 50-cedi notes in exchange for vouchers as ordered by the defense council. ""The exercise should reduce by 20 percent the approximately 6 billion cedis in circulation"" and help bring down Ghana's inflation rate, a knowledgeable source said. ""People's defense committees"" have sprung up in city neighborhoods, in rural villages and in industries to work out problems; they also act as watchdogs against corruption and black market dealings. But despite nominal backing by the armed forces for the defense council, informed Ghanaians say they have become nervous about military discipline after a chain of rank and file mutinies recently among the 12,000 soldiers and 2,600 Air Force and Navy personnel. On Feb. 4, sailors at Ghana's Sekondi Naval Base reportedly shot to death three of their officers before soldiers from a nearby Army camp intervened and rescued the remaining naval officers, who then refused to return to their base, sources said. Three days later, soldiers in the central city of Kumasi went on a two-day rampage after an Army major was stoned to death during an altercation at a church. The soldiers killed the pastor of the church,, burned down four churches and wrecked four others, according to a local paper and independent sources. ""Orders for all troops to report to barracks have been greeted with mutinies,"" said one well-placed source. ""There has been an unhealed split between officers and their men since 1979."" Rawlings first came to power in a June 1979 coup that overthrew the regime of Gen. Frederick Akuffo. The coup was carried out by junior and noncommissioned officers and Army privates against the corruption of their officers. Akuffo and seven other high-ranking officers were executed and a number of jailed. Rawlings handed power to an elected Limann government in September. Last month, unlike 1979, Rawlings' defense council immediately began to consolidate power by bringing most of the relatively independent press under its control. In mid-January, the local press reported a planned U.S.-supported invasion of 1,000 British commandos to be launched from Nigeria to return Limann (who is in detention with 200 other prisoners) to office. All three governments have vigorously denied the reports. The defense council also has begun to bring the heretofore independent 500,000-member trade union congress under its control. The defense council recently appointed 18 Cabinet-level department secretaries but has failed to agree on a secretary of finance or an economic recovery plan. The new government faces drastically reduced revenues as Ghana's cocoa crop--representing 70 percent of government revenues--has fallen from 570,000 tons in 1957 down to 250,000 tons exported last year. The drop has halved annual cocoa earnings to $440 million. The country is $400 million in arrears on short-term debt (total debt is $1.4 billion). Lack of foreign exchange is halting imports and import-dependent industries are operating at 15 percent capacity. A serious food shortage is not far off. ""All of these matters will be taken care of,"" said new Secretary of Information Attoh Austin. A history of ""deep-seated corruption, lawlessness and indiscipline are the real causes of these problems,"" he added. On reports of mutinies among the armed forces, Austin said, ""There have been some cases of friction, but I think they are isolated . . . ."""11-Oct-82,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (99%); AFRICA (92%); UNITED STATES (79%);","If cities moved, Kinshasa's gait would be a fitful lurch.  Its life rises and breaks, moments of high fever giving way to collapse and dulled sleep. Beneath the town, the Congo River smashes into rapids, but at Kinshasa the water sits - a dark brown lake, syrupy, cola gone flat. The city is enormous, with a population of perhaps three million, although no one could really count the people waiting for buses, begging, pushing wheelbarrows, peering from huts, lying in the dirt, walking, shouting, riding in limousines. There are millions here trying to make some kind of life in a city whose good humor and cruelty can be both confounding and unbearable.  The last few days in Kinshasa have been strange, anesthetized ones. The chiefs of state of France and the French-speaking African countries were in town for their annual conference, and Kinshasa had newly tarred roads and whitewashed curbs. The crowds were gone from the streets. A visitor who had once spent a lot of time in Kinshasa, appalled and attracted by its special, outlaw energy, asked an old acquaintance, an African who studied in the United States, what had happened. ''The word came down,'' he said. ''These were the days when Kinshasa was supposed to behave like Williamsburg, Va. They gave everybody Friday and Saturday off. They stopped the buses. The city wasn't there. Everything was quiet.'' Not many people believe statistics about Kinshasa, or about Zaire, because here there seem to be two sets of books for all the numbers in the country, down to license plates and telephones. Once, Zaire seemed about to become enormously rich. Instead it has drifted near bankruptcy. There are figures - like Zaire's $946 million debt-servicing obligation for the year, and its foreign debt of something like $5 billion - but they mean relatively little, The only numbers people believe are the ones reflecting the disintegration they see every day. For example, an ambassador said that a bus company with 120 buses had only four that worked. The air force has 17 Mirage fighters, but only seven that fly. The army bought 200 Panhard tanks, but about 100 are not usable. Air Zaire has three medium-range Boeing jetliners.  Two fly every now and then, and the third has been cannibalized for parts to keep the others going. Some pilots have not been paid in months. Airport workers siphon aviation fuel from arriving planes and sell it as kerosene in the city. More numbers: Zaire's monthly fuel bill is about $25 million in a country whose income allows only about $30 million in foreign currency expenditures. Gasoline is scarce. People sleep in cars waiting for fuel and pay bribes to get it. Theft, begging, and bribery are so institutionalized on official levels that the country was referred to in a recent report by a former International Monetary Fund official as corrupt beyond shame. Despite its indisputable burdens, Kinshasa is often described, in a rush of local boosterism, as ''relatively safe'' for foreigners. The phrase was used the other night by a woman who works at the Hotel Memling in the center of town. But when a visitor asked about walking to a restaurant about 500 yards away, the woman said she would send a security man to accompany the guest. ''He knows the best route,'' she said. ''And we give him a club.'' President Mobutu Sese Seko has run the country since 1965. The credo of the single party in the country, the Popular Revolutionary Movement, is known as ''Mobutuism.'' Central to it is a respect for the teachings of the Guide, as the President is known. There are 13 former legislators serving 15-year prison sentences for expressing interest in creating another political party, a grave form of deviationism in Kinshasa. The other day, while the conference was on, Mr. Mobutu invited a small group of reporters to the terrace of his presidential palace, set at the top of a sloping lawn that runs past the swimming pool and toward the distant Congo River. The President, who is a relaxed, unflustered handler of any kind of question, said that there was ''an international mafia'' of people plotting to harm the reputation of Zaire and his capital. He said this was partly because there was no place in Zaire for fashionable and empty ideologies. ''We don't please very much,'' he explained.  ''On the other hand, my people breathe and sing and dance. Thanks to my skill.'' A comic book of the Guide's life story is sold by hawkers downtown. In it, Mr. Mobutu kills a lion as a boy, leads machine-gun charges as a soldier and shakes the hand of Mao Zedong, Queen Elizabeth and Richard Nixon. The hawkers' starting price for a copy is the equivalent of $6. Interested buyers with time and patience can purchase the comic book for about 90 cents. In their few days here the chiefs of state saw almost nothing of the city -motorcade trips, limousines with darkened windows and helicopters kept Kinshasa at a distance. On an afternoon off, President Mobutu took them up the Congo River in his riverboat. When it was time to eat, a helicopter landed on a pad at the stern, and chinaware and copper pots full of food were carried from it, There was champagne from a nine-liter bottle -about the size of a fire hydrant - roast pig and mutton, beer and bananas. In two hours of sailing, there was almost no movement, no human form on the shore, just one canoe, with a family poking at something in the mud. The boat tied up at Nsele, a model farm and party headquarters, where Muhammad Ali trained for his heavyweight title fight in Kinshasa against George Foreman. Eventually, the guests boarded a bus to return to Kinshasa. The capital's reality, and that of Zaire, took over on the way back to the city. The bus broke down."30-Jun-83,MALAWI (99%); CENTRAL AFRICA (94%); AFRICA (93%); RUSSIAN FEDERATION (92%); CHINA (79%);,"The citizens of this landlocked Central African country voted today in a parliamentary election that will probably cause little change in either their lives or in the way this country has been governed for the last 19 years. About two million of Malawi's six million people are believed to have registered to vote for candidates bidding for the 101 elected seats in Parliament. As they have little final say over who the candidates are or what they stand for, the true test of sentiment will be the level of abstentions, reflecting apathy or protest. Malawi is a one-party state run by a Life President, Dr. Hastings Kamuzu Banda, who has led the nation since its independence from Britain in 1964. He has done so in a manner described by friends as paternalistic and by enemies as harshly dictatorial, controlling both the political and the economic life of the country. Apart from the presidency, he also heads the Ministries of Agriculture, Justice, Information, Tourism, Works, Foreign Affairs and Defense. An Untypical African Nation It has been an idiosyncratic period of one-man rule. Malawi is the only African country to recognize South Africa, its political opposition has been dealt with summarily and the nation has acquired a reputation as an African odd man out, isolated from the mainstream of the continent's politics. But despite crushing poverty and severely limited resources, Malawi is also one of the few African nations able to feed itself, and Western aid donors rate its use of foreign assistance highly. Mistrustful of Communist nations, Malawi does not have relations with China or the Soviet Union. President Banda is said to view the Russians as ''uncivilized'' because, he reportedly told visitors recently, Russia was never colonized by the Romans. He is a great respecter of ancient Rome and Greece. The conduct of the elections illustrates his political style.  Candidates, all of whom are members of the Malawi Congress Party, are theoretically chosen by the people who will vote for them, but President Banda - the self-titled Ngwazi, or Conquering Hero, of the nation - has the power of veto over the list of candidates presented to him before the vote. Qualifications Specified The official electoral rules say candidates should include ''persons who have never been expelled or suspended from the party; persons who are not subversive; persons who are of sound mind.'' They must all pass an English literacy test before being approved. The candidates in Malawian elections do not campaign or speak to their potential constituents. ''People are not allowed to canvass for candidature,'' the rules state. ''If canvassing is allowed, people who aspire to go to Parliament will be tempted to bribe and corrupt the people in the district. Bribery and corruption would enable people who are rich and crooks to go to Parliament.'' Thus, the candidates are presented to the voters at official meetings and the electorate makes its choice on the basis of this encounter. Parliament itself, Malawian officials acknowledge, is subservient to the party. As electoral systems go, it makes for a tranquil vote. There are no loudspeaker vans exhorting the populace to choose one candidate or another, no placards or posters depicting the aspirants, no tubthumping rallies, no ferment. The only public portrait on show is that of the Life President, currently on wide display in anticipation of celebrations on July 6. That was the day, 25 years ago, that Dr. Banda returned from his medical practice in Ghana to lead the struggle against colonialism. Fetes Are Spectacular It was also the day, six years later, that Britain's Union Jack was furled for the last time and independence was declared.  In preparation for the anniversaries, most city buildings are bedecked in green, black and red - the party colors - and women in particular are preparing for one of Dr. Banda's public appearances.  These are widely regarded as spectacular. President Banda will arrived at his stadium in an open Land-Rover, wearing his traditional outfit - a dark three-piece suit, a homburg hat and dark glasses - and carrying a fly wisk, his personal totem. Women will dance for him, dressed in brightly colored cloths printed with his portrait. At intervals, Dr. Banda will descend from the podium to join the dance, engulfed in a sea of ululating dancers so that only the fly wisk, held aloft, is visible. Then he will return to the podium. Speculation Forbidden The Life President's age is unclear. Officially it is put at about 77. Other estimates put it in the mid-80's, but speculation about the matter is forbidden here, as is public discussion about who will succeed him. Visitors who have seen him recently say he shows no sign of intending to relinquish power and no indication of weakened faculties, but his control of the nation has not been without challenge. Dr. Banda's career began when, according to his official biography, he walked 1,000 miles to South Africa to seek education and work.  Later, he went to the United States and was educated in subjects including medicine in Massachusetts, Ohio and Indiana. He qualified as a doctor in Edinburgh, Scotland, and did not return to his country for almost 40 years, until 1958, when the nation was called Nyasaland and was part of the British-run federation that also consisted of present-day Zambia and Zimbabwe. Among the many initials and titles that follow his name is the Order of D.O.F., meaning Destroyer of the Federation, a title bestowed by Zambia in 1975 in recognition of his opposition to British colonialism. Dr. Banda was detained for a year by the British for his activism in 1959. White Officials Retained Almost immediately after independence, a first challenge arose when six ministers opposed Dr. Banda's insistence on the retention of whites to help run the country. The six lost the battle after a 48-hour sitting of Parliament and fled into exile. One of them, former Justice Minister Orton Chirwa, and his wife, Vera, are currently under sentence of death here, having been lured back into the country two years ago and charged with treason under a legal system framed by Mr. Chirwa himself. The former minister led one of several largely ineffective exiled Malawian opposition groups. Another exile, Atati Mpakati, was assassinated in Zimbabwe last March. Three Government ministers and one member of Parliament died last month in a mysterious car accident that many people believe was a political killing. Over the years, several thousand people have been imprisoned for political offenses. The number of such detainees now is put by foreigners at 40 to 50. Big Foreign Debt Incurred In recent years, Malawi has run up a crushing foreign debt of $750 million, forcing it to spend 43 percent of its export earnings from tobacco, sugar and tea on repayments. Both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are expected to provide loans to help ease the problem, but only in return for domestic changes. There is expected to be pressure, Western economists said, for reorganization of Press Holdings, the country's biggest private company. President Banda holds 90 percent of the company stock, the economists said, supposedly in trust for the nation but used sometimes to finance personal projects. A traveler, for instance, might, while driving on a long and rutted dirt track in the bush, suddenly come upon a village equipped with running water and tarred roads and neat brick bungalows and electricity. Other villages lack these amenities - indeed, are dirt poor - but then, they are not the birthplace of a close relative of the President."13-Oct-83,KENYA (99%); SOMALIA (95%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%);,"President Daniel arap Moi was inaugurated today for a second full term and put in office a Cabinet that reflects Kenya's present economic pressures as well as the political change the country is undergoing. The new Cabinet, the first personally selected by Moi, also follows tradition by spreading ministerial appointments geographically to appease the country's many ethnic groups and tribes. Moi, reelected last month, a little more than a year after an unsuccessful military coup, has emerged as a stronger leader of this East African country and finally shed the grip of the once powerful supporters of the late Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's founding father. Two breaks with tradition were Moi's appointment of an apolitical university mathematics professor to head the Finance Ministry and the first Cabinet-level appointment of a Kenyan Somali, from the country's once turbulent northeast border region adjoining Somalia. The once dominant influence of Kenyatta's Kikuyu people continues to wane since his death and the Kikuyus control only four ministries in the new Cabinet, half the number they controlled in the past. The Kikuyus are Kenya's largest ethnic group, making up 20 percent of the country's 17.8 million people. A major change is the absence from the political scene of Charles Njonjo, the powerful attorney general for 17 years under Kenyatta and then member of Parliament and minister under Moi. Njonjo continued as a powerful figure after Kenyatta's death in 1978 with Moi's blessing but was reportedly caught by Moi earlier this year in a political takeover bid. He was dropped from the Cabinet then and has faded into obscurity. A newly elected member of Parliament, Hussein Maalam Mohamed, 34, has been appointed by Moi as minister of state in the president's office. He is the first Kenyan Somali to be given a Cabinet-level post. Mohamed is the younger brother of Lt. Gen. Mahmoud Mohamed, an Army leader and Moi loyalist who crushed the coup attempt last year by dissident Air Force officers. Because of Somalia's claims on parts of northeast Kenya, which is inhabited by ethnic Somalis, and insurgent attacks against Kenyan forces in the region in past years, Kenyan Somalis have been looked upon by the government as harboring divided loyalties. ""Somalis have been treated as second-class citizens here,"" said one Kenyan political observer, adding that the Mohamed brothers' prominent roles may end ""this practice and the Somalis' feeling of isolation."" Moi's administration still faces a recession-hit economy with problems exacerbated by unsettling levels of corruption. Economic grievances and charges of official corruption were some of the complaints of those who led the coup attempt. After three years of steady economic decline, Kenya has begun to experience a slight upturn this year but the country's economic difficulties are far from ended. Thus Moi's choice of George Saitoti, a University of Nairobi mathematics professor, as finance minister is seen here as ""a new seriousness on the part of this government of getting Kenya's financial house in order,"" said an economic analyst who asked not to be identified. In a belt-tightening speech following his swearing-in this afternoon, Moi, 59, touched on several of the most worrying aspects of Kenya's economy, including a high external debt of $2.9 billion, rising unemployment which is now over 30 percent, the severe economic drain on government resources of 147 government agencies, many of them criticized as being mismanaged, and Kenya's 4 percent annual population growth rate, one of the highest in the world. There will soon be an end to overseas borrowing for development projects, Moi said, and more reliance put on the efficient use of domestic resources. ""I will not pretend that this will be easy to do,"" he said, but the government ""will help where we can. We cannot afford to borrow more than we can repay."" Kenya was badly hurt beginning in 1979 by the world drop in prices for tea and coffee exports, which provide 40 percent of the country's earnings. Government spending above agreed-upon ceilings led to the suspension in January 1982 of an International Monetary Fund financial aid package. Economic growth--more than 6 percent annually in the 1960s and 1970s--fell to 2.7 percent in 1981 and to 2 percent by 1982. The Kenyan government estimates that the coup attempt resulted in foreign exchange losses of $73 million from reduced tourist revenues (normally 10 percent of foreign exchange earnings), imports of equipment replacements and the transfer of capital out of the country. With increases in tea and coffee prices this year, Kenya's foreign exchange situation has gone from ""desperate""--with money on hand to finance less than one month's imports--to a better than two-month level. The country is expected to earn $900 million this year, about $6 million more than last year, and the economic growth rate has climbed to 2.6 percent. Importantly, the IMF signed a new $170 million aid package with Kenya last March after it was able to produce an austerity budget of $1.48 billion. A $60 million budget deficit is made up in part with aid donations from western countries and IMF assistance. ""The Kenyans have made some deep cuts in their domestic spending that are good for now but will probably have a negative impact on their economic growth in the long run,"" said one economist. ""They'll need some good luck and continued tight fiscal management for a good while to come,"" he said."1-Jan-84,NIGERIA (96%); AFRICA (94%); UNITED STATES (79%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%);,"The abrupt overthrow of Nigeria's fledgling civilian government yesterday ended one of the most important political milestones in black Africa in recent years. The coup sponsored by elements of the country's armed forces--and the reported arrests of the country's civilian politicians, including President Shehu Shagari--extinguished, for the moment at least, a 4 1/2-year-old multiparty democratic government rare in Africa and the Third World. Oil-rich Nigeria--the most populous and wealthiest of black African nations--had been held up as a showcase of political reform in 1979 when it returned to civilian government after 13 years of military rule. Shagari, elected that year, was reelected by a wide margin last August. With a new constitution based on the U.S. model, it was felt that Nigeria's bold experiment with democracy could influence other West African countries to loosen the reins of their one-party states and military dictatorships, the prevalent form of government in Africa. But Nigeria's severe economic problems, brought on by the recent worldwide oil glut, and its tolerance for widespread corruption were soon to mar the nation's model reputation. Those two trends laid the groundwork for yesterday's coup. As world oil demand dropped in recent years, Nigeria's already badly managed economy plunged into chaos. Almost overnight, Shagari's administration, halfway through its first term, had to forsake the promise of abundance for a policy of economic restraint. Food prices soared; unemployment rose. Shagari imposed an import ban that forced many industries to operate at 25 percent of capacity or less. On Thursday, Shagari presented his latest austerity budget to parliament, calling on Nigerians to make further sacrifices as his government struggled to make up a growing deficit and meet the conditions for a badly needed $2.5 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. It was a far cry from the first two heady years of Nigeria's civilian government, when oil export revenues quadrupled to an unprecedented high of $24 billion. Shagari then embarked on an ambitious rural development program, committing billions of dollars to the agrarian communities where more than 75 percent of the country's approximately 100 million people live. Billions more were earmarked for the new capital, Abuja, as well as for heavy industries and badly needed roads, telecommunications and inexpensive housing. Amid all of the plenty, however, a venal circle of politicians, some of them close to Shagari, began to embezzle funds on a pervasive scale. Critics of the government were practically unanimous in characterizing Shagari as an honest politician, but in the same breath they called him weak for allowing his cronies to raid government coffers unpunished. By the time of the coup, corruption at every level of government had become expected practice. Even with the unprecedented wealth, Shagari's government was unsuccessful in passing it down to the urban and rural poor, who make up the overwhelming majority of the nation's almost 100 million population. A small elite, by comparison, grew increasingly rich. The growing tensions were made more ominous by the country's history of domestic upheaval. Six years after independence from Britain in 1960, Nigeria had its first in a series of bloody military coups. At that time, the Army moved against a civilian government that was widely seen as corrupt and whose blatant rigging of elections had sparked rioting and near anarchy in the country's western region. The first coup led to a military countercoup in mid-1966, followed by a tragic 2 1/2-year civil war, a third coup, a bloody coup attempt and, finally, the voluntary handover of power by the Army to an elected government in 1979. The 1979 elections were tightly supervised by the Army and were widely accepted in Nigeria as free and fair. The second set of elections, held last summer, was supervised by Shagari's civilian government and was widely criticized as being unfairly rigged to favor his party. In their initial proclamation after yesterday's coup, the Nigerian Army officers said they overthrew Shagari's second administration because it was ""inept and corrupt."" Charges of corruption have become obligatory post-coup allegations, but in Nigeria large numbers of the population will be only too ready to believe the charges."3-Jan-84,NIGERIA (94%); AFRICA (93%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%);,"The leaders of Nigeria's new military government, unveiling their plans for Africa's troubled giant, are stressing administrative continuity, coupled with economic austerity and a crackdown on public corruption. The new military leader, Maj. Gen. Mohammed Buhari, summoned the country's senior civil servants to a meeting today at which he pledged his government would listen to their advice and seek maximum continuity with the old administration of deposed President Shehu Shagari, according to radio accounts from Lagos monitored here. The whereabouts of Shagari, reportedly arrested in central Nigeria, is still unknown. Buhari, who took power in an apparently bloodless coup Saturday, warned the administrators that the new 16-member Supreme Military Council, which he heads, would not tolerate dishonesty in government. Corruption had been pervasive in the Shagari administration. Buhari suggested corrupt officials would be jailed without trial, saying he would forego ""the nonsenses of litigation"" in dealing with offenders. Western diplomats and analysts here, while cautioning that it is still too soon to draw a definitive picture, believe Buhari and his fellow officers will follow a conservative financial policy. They pointed to his pledges to honor Nigeria's foreign debts, estimated at more than $15 billion, and to maintain its membership in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as signs that he is not planning to lead Nigeria down a radical political or economic path. ""All indications so far are that this will be a conventional, conservative Moslem government,"" said one diplomat who has served in Nigeria. But there is uncertainty about Buhari's ultimate political agenda for Africa's most populous nation. Although Moslems have predominated in government, there are many different religious sects in Nigeria, including large numbers of Christians in the southeast and followers of traditional African beliefs. Religious differences have been a source of political and social strife in the past. Fundamentalist splinter groups of the northern-based Moslems have been blamed for major riots in the north in recent years. Observers here say the 41-year-old infantry commander, a Moslem from northern Nigeria, is considered a conscientious native son who, unlike some of his fellow officers, has had limited contacts with westerners despite his British military education and is a firm believer in national pride. He is believed to have been a leading member of that faction of the Army which resisted handing power back to civilians in 1979. Many analysts here believe Nigeria may be facing a future of successive military governments similar to those that ran the country between 1966 and 1979. Buhari is also considered a strong adherent to the view that only harsh economic medicine can cure Nigeria of its current fiscal ills. If so, he would likely prove willing to complete arrangements for a $2.5 billion loan package from the International Monetary Fund, which was urging the Shagari government to devalue Nigeria's currency and cut back government spending and imports to rescue the country's stricken economy. Earlier last week, Shagari had spelled out a package of economic reforms that he said would begin the painful process of retrenchment. But the new program apparently was not enough to dissuade the military leaders, whose coup plans were probably already in motion, observers here say. Although corruption has long been considered endemic in Nigeria, including under previous military governments, even avid supporters of Nigeria's democracy concede official corruption was so staggering under the civilians that it was likely to undermine Shagari's new plan. Nigeria, one of the United States' leading oil suppliers, has been in serious economic difficulties since the world oil market became glutted and prices began to fall in late 1981. Buhari, who headed the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation before 1979 under the old military government, is expected by many here to take personal charge of the country's oil policy. Officials of Venezuela, another non-Arab OPEC state, today expressed concern that the new government might unilaterally cut prices and increase oil production, setting off a possible oil price war within the organization, Reuter reported today from Caracas. American diplomats who deal with Africa say they have adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward the new government, which heads a country that is the United States' largest African trading partner. The Reagan administration has been criticized by some Africa watchers, who say it has emphasized American interests in southern Africa and friendlier ties with white-ruled South Africa while virtually ignoring what they see as at least equally important interests in countries like Nigeria. U.S. officials say they were quietly lending support to the Shagari government. The State Department had identified Nigeria as one of several Third World nations with growing debt problems that might warrant additional U.S. financial help. But an official said no support was possible until the Shagari government was prepared to crack down convincingly on corruption and institute strong economic measures. One source said Nigerian officials had told western governments privately that nothing could be done until after Shagari's reelection last August because of the incumbent government's fear of alienating the Nigerian electorate. ""It would have been impossible to expect Congress and the taxpayers to bail out Nigeria when so many of its financial problems were the result of people stealing money,"" the source said. But no analyst here today suggested stronger U.S. support could have saved the Shagari government from overthrow. ""It's a very, very sad situation but it's an internal question,"" said one analyst here. ""I doubt very much there was anything any of the western democracies could have done."""3-Jan-84,NIGERIA (94%); UNITED STATES (93%); AFRICA (92%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%);,"IN A COUNTRY that has known two earlier coups, a civil war and 13 years of military leadership since becoming independent in 1960, it can be no surprise that democratic government has succumbed again to a military takeover, as it just has in Nigeria. President Shehu Shagari had won resounding reelection last August. But the extent--not the fact --of his margin was attributable to fraud and malpractice of dimensions that left Nigeria a ""wounded democracy."" The resulting disenchantment, combined with Mr. Shagari's inability to reduce the deep economic distress and pervasive corruption, produced a readiness--in some quarters evidently even a longing--for the sort of firmness and efficiency associated with military rule. The new leader is Maj. Gen. Mohammed Buhari, 41, a British-educated officer of both political and technocratic bent who had a hand in an earlier coup and also served as oil minister. He moved at a moment of his predecessor's certain vulnerability--two days after Mr. Shagari had presented the austerity budget required under the terms of Nigeria's latest credit from the International Monetary Fund. Gen. Buhari made his move, he said, to save the nation from ""imminent collapse."" He takes upon himself and his brother officers a burden that cannot fail to tax their capabilities to the utmost. The oil glut has left Nigeria, a country almost wholely dependent on oil revenues, struggling to pay its bills and to meet the expectations of its 100 million citizens. A country's resources are not automatically magnified by a coup. As a sometime democracy, the United States' second largest oil supplier, black Africa's most powerful state and a friendly, Western-oriented country, Nigeria has long been of special concern to America. Oil and political considerations aside, Americans have been keenly interested to see whether the democratic enterprise could flourish on post-colonial African soil. Nigeria has been one of the few places on the continent where elected representative government seemed likely to take root. It could still happen. Economic and ethnic strains may push the central national government toward coercion, but an African tradition of self-government and Britain's colonial teachings are still alive. Nigeria is a giant struggling to live up to its own ambitious ideals. Its previous military leaders tried to avoid giving military rule the harsh name it has in most other African countries. Of the many tests before Gen. Buhari, the first is to ensure that arbitrary vengeance is not wreaked upon the deposed civilian leadership, which, whatever its shortcomings, did represent the people's choice."4-Jan-84,NIGERIA,"Africa's biggest democracy became Africa's biggest dictatorship last weekend. The military overthrow of any popularly elected government is a setback for freedom but it is especially grievous coming in Nigeria. Nigeria's democratic experiment was prepared with care. The military rulers of the 1970's sponsored a new, federalist system inspired by that of the United States, right down to political conventions. They hoped it could contain the tribalism and regionalism that defeated the parliamentary form left behind by the British. For nearly five years, Nigeria's hopes were rewarded. A milestone passed just last summer with the completion of a second round of national elections. Irregularities were not so pervasive as to shadow President Shehu Shagari's re-election mandate - not until ambitious soldiers seized on impatience with corruption and economic decline to produce last weekend's coup. The magnitude of the loss is evident from the way the new strongman dismisses trials for the allegedly corrupt. ''Nonsenses,'' he calls them. Corruption has seemed endemic in Nigeria under civilian and military rule alike - hard to avoid when huge oil revenues pour into an underdeveloped nation. In any case, patronage is probably an indispensable tool in stitching together a diverse and conflict-ridden society into a national political system.  But corruption has also been a real issue, repelling civic-minded Nigerians. In the end it seems to have undermined what should have been President Shagari's biggest asset, the legitimacy of his rule.  Against that background, the proximate cause of Mr. Shagari's demise was the austerity budget he just proposed. That fiscal plan was formulated in the context of debt-rescheduling negotiations with the I.M.F. No mere change in government can lessen Nigeria's huge debt.  The oil glut has devastated Nigeria's economy. What was a boom three years ago has turned into a $12 billion decline in annual oil revenues. Other OPEC countries were hit in the pocketbook; Nigeria, with a far larger population, was hit in the solar plexus.  The alarm that sounded in Nigeria resonates elsewhere. The oil glut, high interest rates and recession are squeezing virtually every economy in the third world. That is not an environment in which democracy can flourish, no matter how well laid the plans. If America cares about democracy in the rest of Africa, Asia and Latin America, it will have to lend more than its political structure."1-May-84,NIGERIA (94%); AFRICA (92%);,"Four months after seizing power, Nigeria's military leaders appear to be suffering an erosion of popular support. Last Dec. 31, Maj. Gen. Mohammed Buhari led a group of young officers in a coup against the civilian Government of President Shehu Shagari, saying the takeover was necessary to save Nigeria, Africa's richest and most populous nation, from economic collapse. The military intervention appeared at the time to enjoy enthusiastic support from a broad range of Nigeria's population. Many intellectuals argued that the corruption and incompetence of the Shagari administration had made drastic action both necessary and inevitable. Traders, merchants and people in the streets welcomed the soldiers and looked forward to a quick improvement in their standard of living. Growing Disappointment Recently, however, there seems to be growing disappointment with both the military Government's approach and pace. ''Since coming to power, this Government has not found a single problem,'' said Dr. Olu Onagoruwa, a prominent lawyer and a longtime opponent of the Shagari administration. ''But it has managed to alienate the judiciary, the press, labor and students - all the groups that supported it just a few months ago.'' Critics of the military Government point out that it has yet to present its budget. Loan negotiations with the International Monetary Fund continue but Western economists say that Nigeria and the I.M.F. appear to be further apart now than during the final days of the Shagari administration. Early indications that General Buhari would agree to devalue Nigeria's currency, liberalize trade and reduce domestic petroleum subsidies have so far not materialized. Prices Have Climbed In addition, prices for food and other essential commodities, which fell in the first weeks after the coup largely because of the presence of soldiers in the marketplaces, have now returned to or exceeded their levels before the coup. Unemployment has been rising, and many of the imported raw materials and spare parts needed to keep factories running have been lacking. Critics note further that political activity and even debate have been banned and some students organizations have been outlawed. There has been a clampdown on Nigeria's press, and the country's traditionally independent judiciary has also seen its role sharply diminished. ''At the moment we're looking at a clear movement toward authoritarian dictatorship,'' said Stanley N. Macebuh, executive editor of The Guardian, an independent newspaper that had often taken the Shagari administration to task. ''It's a trend that disturbs a lot of people, not least those who welcomed the change of government.'' Spokesmen for the military leadership maintain that they know what they are doing and refuse to be rushed. They deny the charges of inaction, saying that steps have been taken. Trials Being Prepared The Government, they say, has put much energy into investigating the corruption of the Shagari administration and in preparing tribunals to try the accused, close to 500 of whom are now under detention. Officials say about 2,000 illegal aliens have been ejected from the country and several thousand people have been detained in a crackdown on suspected criminals and Moslem extremists. They say Nigeria's bloated bureaucracy has been streamlined through the dismissal of thousands of officials and civil servants. Three weeks ago an agreement was reached in London on converting a part of Nigeria's uninsured trade debts into loans. The Government's critics respond that the economic initiatives treat symptoms rather than causes and aid the larger issue of how to restructure Nigeria's economy. A Western diplomat said General Buhari ''could have accomplished so much if he had moved quickly and boldly in the early days when his popularity was still so high and when he could have credibly blamed everything on Shagari.''"5-Jul-85,GUINEA (95%); TOGO (94%); AFRICA (94%); COTE D'IVOIRE (93%); MALI (92%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%);,"Former Prime Minister Diarra Traore of Guinea seized power tonight after President Lansana Conte left the country to attend a meeting of African leaders in Togo. The takeover was announced by Colonel Traore on the Conakry radio, which said later that Colonel Conte, a French-trained army officer, had been declared a ''citizen in exile.'' Colonel Traore did not say whether there had been any bloodshed. 'Intolerable Disorder' Cited He said that after 26 years of dictatorship, nepotism and economic sabotage under former President Ahmed Sekou Toure, Guineans had suffered 15 months of ''disappointment, of intolerable disorder'' which had ruined the hopes raised by the coup led by Colonel Conte in April 1984. Colonel Conte is in the Togolese capital, Lome, for the meeting Friday of 10 African leaders of the Economic Community of West African States. Colonel Conte is current chairman of the group. The Conakry radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, broadcast a communique by the Supreme State Council tonight saying the ruling Military Committe of National Recovery, headed by Colonel Conte, had been abolished. It added that the Government ''composed of elements whose major concern was only to personally enrich themselves'' had been dismissed. Colonel Traore and Colonel Conte had ruled together in an uneasy alliance since last year's army takeover shortly after the death of President Toure, who had ruled the country for 26 years. Colonel Traore served as Colonel Conte's Prime Minister until December 1984, when he was demoted to Minister of State for Education. Colonel Conte himself assumed the duties of the Prime Minister. Colonel Conte said then that he had reshuffled his Cabinet and abolished the post of Prime Minister because of what he called incompetence and corruption. In the last few months Guinea's 5.5 million people have become increasingly disillusioned over the lack of improvement in living standards in a country that is potentialy one of Africa's richest. The military's main achievement since the coup last year has been the release of thousands of political prisoners jailed under President Toure. Colonel Conte was reluctant to carry out economic austerity measures for fear of social unrest. These included a devaluation of the country's currency, the syli, a step recommended by the International Monetary Fund. The period since the coup has been marked by a breakdown in law and order, a rise in crime and even some nostalgia for the Toure era. After his demotion, Colonel Traore remained the second-ranking member of the military committee. But analysts said it would only be a matter of time before Colonel Traore, an ambitious army officer who adopted a higher profile than the unassuming President, made his move. Disagreements between them split the armed forces into two groups with strong ethnic overtones, they said. Little is known of Colonel Traore's political leanings or his views on economic matters, but in the months after the coup he appeared to espouse Colonel Conte's pledge of a society more open to foreign investment and free entreprise. His radio statement tonight appeared to confirm that Colonel Conte's inability to act on monetary reforms, including the possibility of Guinea joining the franc zone monetary union, was at the root of his action. ''Today it is more than ever necessary to put an end to footdragging in making political, economic and in particular monetary decisions which are to launch the development of our country,'' he said. A Supreme State Council communique broadcast after Colonel Traore's address urged Conakry residents to stay at home until further notice. In his radio address, Colonel Traore said the ''Supreme State Council'' had decided to take the country's destiny in hand because of the ''disintegration of the situation in the country, the hesitations of the last few months, the partisan struggles with some ethnic coloration, the emergence of egotistical interests, the lust for personal power.'' Guinea, a former French colony, has been independent since 1958. During President Toure's years in power, several coup attempts were crushed or foiled, while Guinea became notorious internationally for human-rights abuses. In October 1982, Amnesty International, the London-based human rights organization, named 78 political prisoners it believed had died and asked the Government to account for more than 2,800 others it said had disappeared. President Toure died in a clinic in the United States during emergency heart surgery in March 1984. Struggle for Succession The coup just eight days later, on April 3, put an end to a struggle for succession, ushering in what the army said would be a new era of freedom for Guineans. The military committee that took power denounced President Toure's rule as a ''ruthless and bloody dictatorship'' and said it would restore civil liberties. Colonel Conte announced the complete liberalization of the economy, based on free enterprise and foreign investment, breaking with President Toure's aim of a socialist Guinea with centralized planning, nationalized industries and collective agriculture. Guinea is one of the world's poorest nations, although it has some of the world's largest deposits of minerals. Guinea's 1981 gross national product was $1.6 billion. The main export is bauxite, which brings in about 80 percent of its foreign revenue. Guinea has about eight billion metric tons of bauxite reserves, the largest in the world, with huge resources yet to be developed. Guinea Government The People's Revolutionary Republic of Guinea, a former French colony in West Africa, was proclaimed an independent country on Oct. 2, 1958. The leader of the Democratic Party of Guinea, Ahmed Sekou Toure, became President and served for 26 years until his death on March 26, 1984. His organization became Guinea's sole party. On April 3, 1984, Col. Lansana Conte installed himself as President, suspended the Constitution and dissolved Parliament, replacing it with the 18-member Military Committee for National Rectification. Mr. Toure's political party was also dissolved. Area and Population Guinea has an area of 94,939 square miles, about twice the size of New York State. According to a mid-1983 estimate, Guinea has a population of 5,430,000. Conakry, the capital, is a city of 525,000 inhabitants. Three-quarters of the population is Moslem, one-quarter animist. Besides French, eight African languages are taught in schools. Economy Guinea is one of the leading world producers of bauxite, which is exported to Western countries and to the Soviet Union. More than 80 percent of the people work in agriculture, where the cash crops are coffee, bananas, palm kernels, peanuts and pineapples. Armed Forces The army, consisting of 8,500 men, is equipped with Soviet, Czechoslovak and Chinese weapons and armored cars. Guinea also has a militia of 9,200 men, a navy of 600 men and an air force of 800 men."28-Aug-85,NIGERIA (99%); UNITED STATES (93%); AFRICA (92%);,"The Nigerian military government of Maj. Gen. Mohammed Buhari, which struggled for 20 months to cure the country's massive economic problems, was overthrown today in an apparently bloodless coup led by the regime's third-ranking military leader. Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, 44, a career military officer who has played a pivotal role in three previous Nigerian coups, was named this afternoon on Nigerian television as the country's new president and military commander. The country's air and sea ports were sealed off, communications links with the outside world severed and a dawn-to-dusk curfew announced in major urban centers. Nigeria's land borders have been closed since shortly after the ousted government took power. In an address tonight on Nigerian television, Bagangida said the Buhari government had been ""too rigid and uncompromising,"" had failed to end ""economic mismanagement"" and had caused ""intolerable suffering."" He also promised to release several Nigerian journalists who had been jailed under a 16-month-old law restricting criticism of the government. Earlier, in announcing the takeover in Africa's most populous nation, the sixth in the 25 years since Nigeria's independence from Britain, an Army officer said the action was taken because the Buhari government had misused power and wasted the country's resources. ""We could not stay passive and watch a small group of individuals misuse power to the detriment of our national aspirations,"" said Brig. Joshua Dogoniaro on Lagos Radio this morning. Nigeria size and oil wealth, as well as its estimated 100 million population, underpin its influence in Africa. It also is an important trade partner of the United States, which imports about half of the country's oil output. Buhari came to power at the end of 1983 in a military takeover and pledged to resuscitate the Nigerian economy by ending the corruption and economic mismanagement of the 4 1/2-year-old civilian government of Shehu Shagari. The coup that brought Buhari to power was ""welcomed by the nation with unprecedented enthusiasm,"" the Army spokesman said this morning. But, ""almost two years later,"" he added, ""it has become clear that the fulfillment of expectations is not forthcoming."" The goals of the 1983 takeover ""have been betrayed and discarded."" Buhari's whereabouts were unclear today. Western diplomats in London said that Buhari had been in Lagos, the Nigerian capital, yesterday. Lagos was reported calm today after the coup. In Washington, the State Department said there was no indication of any dangers to the 7,000-strong American community in Nigeria. ""We have had a good relationship with Nigeria based on a convergence of enduring national interests . . . . We expect that this relationship will continue,"" spokesman Charles E. Redman said. In Santa Barbara, Calif., White House spokesman Larry Speakes said that ""Lagos is calm and radio announcements are encouraging peace and calm,"" The Associated press reported. The toppling of the Shagari government in 1983 brought an end to an experiment in multiparty democratic rule that was regarded as a political milestone in black Africa. Buhari, the new leader, moved quickly to implement his pledges to revive the economy by imposing austerity measures that laid off government workers, slashed social benefits, canceled industrial projects and kept Nigerians from spending their money on imported luxuries. A succession of harsh laws were passed to stop corruption, smuggling, street violence and curb political dissent. The government mounted a highly publicized ""war against indiscipline."" Buhari's tough policies, however, while helping to trim the deficit and making Nigeria slightly more livable, were not enough to turn around the economy. Nigeria, which boomed in the 1970s, becoming almost completely dependent on its large oil reserves, was not able to recover from a sharp drop in price and demand for oil. Its oil earnings, accounting for about 90 percent of its revenues, are about half what they were in 1980. Inflation is raging at more than 40 percent a year, compared to half that figure 18 months ago, unemployment has surged, there are food shortages and nearly half of the country's export earnings are consumed in servicing a $21 billion foreign debt. Under Buhari, Nigeria had refused to negotiate an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The agreement, which required Nigeria to sharply devalue its currency, open its markets to imports and cut domestic fuel subsidies, would have bailed the country out of its debt squeeze by allowing it to reschedule loans. But in press interviews this year, Buhari said the IMF's medicine was politically impossible and that Nigeria must solve its own problems by tightenting its belt. He declared that Nigeria is ""no longer begging anybody"" and warned of ""very tough"" years ahead for Nigerians. Today's coup, according to diplomatic observers here, indicates that the military officers who orchestrated the 1983 coup and turned power over to Buhari, an experienced administrator, were unwilling to accept his stringent long-term economic prescriptions. One of the leaders of the 1983 New Year's Eve coup was Babangida, the new military leader and Army Chief of Staff on the Supreme Military Council. Although he has no experience as a government administrator, he has a reputation as a a bold and decisive military leader. He made his reputation among lower and middle ranks of the armed forces in 1976 when he walked unarmed into the offices of a radio station and persuaded Army officers attempting a coup to surrender peacefully. According to western diplomats here, a year before Babangida helped foil the 1976 coup attempt, he helped lead a coup that overturned the 9-year-old government of Gen. Yakubu Gowon. Babangida, who received military training in Nigeria, India, Britain and the United States, also is credited with having been a leading organizer of the 1983 coup that toppled Shagari. Diplomats say the general was disappointed when he was passed over in that coup. Babangida also was outranked by Maj. Gen. Tunde Idiagbon, chief of staff of the Supreme Military Council who was responsible for much of the day-to-day management of the government. Babangida is a Moslem from northern Nigeria, one of a succession of northern Moslems, both soldiers and civilians, who have led the country since 1975. In recent months, there have been increasing report of dissatisfaction among Nigeria's southern, mostly Christian population over the dominance of northern Moslems in the government. Support for Buhari reportedly waned sharply in the last year with the imposition of measures restricting freedom of speech and the press. In April 1984, the military government issued a decree that imposed harsh penalties for ""disseminating false information about the government."" The law muzzled Nigeria's traditionally free press."2-Sep-85,NIGERIA (95%);,"Military coups are not the ideal mechanism for changing political leadership, but to judge from the first signs, the latest change in Nigeria may be for the better. The military government of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida has quickly eased the repressive policies of the prior military government, releasing political prisoners and easing up on the country's traditionally outspoken press. It also seems more willing to reach agreement with the International Monetary Fund on the assistance needed to tide Nigeria through financial crisis. Nigeria's most recent experiment in democracy, though carefully designed and sponsored by an enlightened army leadership in the late 1970's, foundered in 1983 amid collapsing oil prices and charges of corruption. Then, the generals designated Gen. Mohammed Buhari to guide a recovery that never came for this large but tribally-fragmented society of some 90 million people. General Buhari worsened economic matters by trying to do without the I.M.F.'s financial assistance. Politically, his regime was tainted by repressive steps like the dramatic kidnapping of a Nigerian emigre from London, prolonged detention of political prisoners and constraints on the press. General Babangida's new Government will find no easy initiatives. Any deal with the I.M.F. will require sacrifices involving pride as well as pain. Corruption and tribal conflict are certain to persist for years, if not decades. Yet the new regime has so far embarked on a more constructive course than its predecessor did. More constructive still would be readmitting Nigeria's people to the process of selecting their leaders, and for that, there is ground at least for qualified hope."3-Oct-85,NIGERIA (96%); AFRICA (93%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%);,"As rain soaked his gold-braided uniform and dribbled from the fingers of his white-gloved hands, the new military leader of Africa's most populous, and highly coup-prone, nation stood at attention Tuesday through an outdoor ceremony marking 25 years of Nigerian independence. The winds and rains of the tropical storm that enveloped Lagos, drenching Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Babangida and 25,000 other Nigerians who crowded into a stadium here, were apt symbols of the political and economic forces that have battered this West African country for the past quarter century. ""I hardly need say that the history of our nation in its independent existence has been a checkered one,"" said Babangida, who in August seized control of the government after orchestrating this West Africa nation's sixth military coup. Three of Nigeria's eight leaders have been assassinated; civilian governments have twice been ousted for alleged incompetence and corruption. The country was riven in the late 1960s by a 30-month-long civil war. Suddenly rich in the 1970s with oil, many of Nigeria's former leaders have been accused of wasting, misusing and stealing much of the money. Now, with a world oil glut, the country is unable to make payments on a $22 billion foreign debt. The general who stood impassively in the warm Lagos rain promised in a prerecorded television speech broadcast Tuesday that his government will break ""the vicious cycle of hope and despair, faith and doubt, affluence and poverty, stability and chaos which had characterized the past quarter century of our national life."" To that effect, Babangida announced a state of economic emergency for the next 15 months. The emergency is intended, he said, to make Nigeria self-sufficient in food production, to make the economy less dependent on its oil exports and to reduce government interference in private enterprise. Babangida banned the import of two staple foods, rice and corn. He also ordered an end to oil ""counter-trade"" deals that had been used to import consumer items and processed foods. In addition, Babangida promised that in 1986 his government would announce a plan for a return to an elected civilian government. A source close to the military government said later Tuesday that the plan would be announced Jan. 1, 1986, but that the transition to civilian rule could take as long as three years. Since Babangida came to power, Nigeria has been preoccupied with a debate over whether it should accept a multibillion-dollar International Monetary Fund loan that would ease the country's worsening debt burden. In return for the money, Nigeria would have to accept several politically unpalatable measures, including sharp devaluation of its currency and cuts in consumer fuel subsidies. In his speech, however, Babangida, who had vowed earlier to break the deadlock on the IMF loan, did not say, or even hint, whether his government would take the loan. According to a government official close to the Armed Forces Ruling Council, Nigeria's top law-making body, Babangida's senior military advisers have told him in recent days not to accept the loan. The loan has been widely condemned here as a ploy by western-influenced international lending agencies to undermine Nigeria's sovereignty. ""It is a question of national pride,"" the official said, adding that Babangida has not yet made up his mind on the IMF deal. During Tuesday's ceremony at Tafawa Balewa Square, named for Nigeria's first civilian leader, who was murdered, Babangida stood in the downpour for nearly two hours. The wind and rain finally subsided shortly before noon as the assembled soldiers fired rifles and cannons in salute to Nigeria's silver jubilee of independence. The volleys of gunfire and low-flying aircraft frightened thousands of bats from trees near the stadium, sending them circling above the crowd as the soggy, stern-faced general was driven away in a black Peugeot."9-Feb-86,NIGERIA (98%);,"Barely a month after seizing power in a quietly managed coup, Nigeria's new President, Maj. Gen. Ibrahim B. Babangida, was reviewing the troops during independence day celebrations. As it happened, it was raining, and the soldiers arrayed before him were drenched. So was the President. ''If my boys stand in the rain, so do I,'' he is reported to have said. That gesture was welcomed by Nigerians who had endured 20 months of rigorously autocratic military rule under another major general. And since that rainy October day, General Babangida, the sixth military man to take over the government since independence 25 years ago, has continued down a path that is a clear departure from that of his predecessors. Again and again during the last five months, the General, a bearish man regarded as a hard worker who is quick to laugh, has put his ear to the ground to hear what his citizens are saying: Do they want to borrow money from the International Monetary Fund? Do they want to return to civilian rule and, if so, in what form? Where should the country's foreign policy head? There is in all this an echo of a populism in conflict with the more conventional notions of military rule on this continent. General Babangida has been accessible to journalists, both foreign and Nigerian. He has toured the country. He has dropped in on birthday parties for the children of soldiers. Nevertheless, an alleged plot to overthrow the Babangida Government was uncovered in December. How real the threat was remains cloudy, but a group of officers, including an army major general, are on trial before a secret military tribunal. If indeed a coup was being planned, as the Government maintains, it could mean that, in moving Nigeria away from corruption, waste and repression spawned by previous regimes, General Babangida is making enemies among those who figure to be his greatest threat - the military. General Babangida responded to the alleged plot with a verbal lashing of his military colleagues. ''I am certain that unless we review our position and take the necessary steps to recapture and reinstate our professional military virtues, we may sooner or later become no better than civilians with guns,'' he said. ''If that happens, we shall have disgraced the military profession and placed the nation in double jeopardy.'' ''The first duty we owe our profession,'' the General continued, ''is actually to belong to it. Our decision to become soldiers must be just that and not an avenue to other things. The determination of policy is not his concern. Right or wrong, to the professional soldiers the state is all.'' With such statements, General Babangida appears to many Nigerians to be slipping out of his military tunic and into a flowing ''riga,'' a robe worn by northern civilians. Indeed, when the General ordered sweeping pay cuts in the public and private sectors, he started with the military. ''When I was the chief of army staff, my perception was restricted to the army,'' he told The Guardian, a newspaper published in Lagos. ''On getting onto this beat, I found there were a lot of other conflicting needs within the country: health, education, rural development problems, etc. I couldn't see it from that point of view when I was chief of army staff.'' And again, in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation, General Babangida made clear his conviction that the military was not going to determine Nigeria's political future. ''What type of people, what type of government, who should participate, who should be in government - I think these are questions that are going to be answered by the people themselves,'' he said, ''and as much as possible the Government is not going to interfere in the people's verdict.'' Such deference to the populace, however, risks the appearance of indecisiveness. Recently, a special legal panel ruled that Nigeria's last civilian President, Shehu Shagari, who was overthrown by the military in December l983 after presiding over what are generally recognized as four of the most corrupt years in post-independence Nigeria, was himself innocent of corruption charges and should be freed. Rather than accept the finding, General Babangida has chosen to sample public opinion. In the north, where Muslims make up more than 90 percent of the population, there have been impassioned cries for the release of Mr. Shagari, who, like the General, is a Muslim. In the south, the verdict in his favor has been denounced. If the former President is released, The Guardian wrote, ''The gap between the rulers and the ruled will further widen. There will be a rise in public cynicism, especially in the notions of culpability and official corruption.'' There have been several weeks of confusion, both in the press and among Government officials, over whether Nigeria joined the Islamic Conference Organization during its January meeting in Morocco. Constitutionally, Nigeria is a secular state, but pressure from the Islamic north has in recent years pushed the country closer to the Muslim world. Last week, General Babangida, who had been keeping quiet, finally conceded that the country had indeed accepted membership. But in an apparent effort to defuse public unhappiness in the south, he appointed a committee to study the issue. Whether such caution is a conscious effort to arrive at national consensus or a way of defusing volatile issues through exhaustive public debate, it nevertheless reflects an uncertainty that could hinder the General's ability to cope with the nation's problems. ''He does not want to run the country as a military leader,'' said Dele Giwa, the editor of the influential weekly magazine Newswatch. ''He wants to be as popular and accepted as possible.''"13-Apr-86,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (95%); AFRICA (94%);","After more than three years of economic austerity intended to revive Zaire's moribund economy, there are still no signs of economic growth or development, according to Western diplomats, economists and bankers. Yet, in the eyes of many Western countries, Zaire's economic experience has become a test case for Africa of efforts to salvage an economy shattered by mismanagement, corruption and wasteful spending. At the same time, Western diplomats are increasingly seeking to paint a more favorable picture of Zaire, a country where corruption reached legendary heights and whose human-rights record has for years been regarded as among Africa's worst. There is, diplomats say, a new Zaire emerging, albeit painfully, in Africa. 'Reason for Optimism' ''The figures say no development, said a senior international aid official here. ''They say regression. Still, there is reason for optimism.'' Economic austerity has meant higher prices for the average Zairian, few if any services and widespread unemployment in urban areas. In rural Zaire, where 80 percent of the population toils, agriculture has remained at little more than subsistence levels. ''The worst should be over,'' a banker said. ''They've done most of the hard work already.'' Problems in Many Areas Zaire's problems are immense and appear virtually insurmountable, both Zairian and foreign experts agree. These are among the problems: * Education at even the elementary level is getting worse rather than improving. * Health care is at best difficult, and at worst impossible to obtain for the average Zairian. Medicines are exorbitantly priced if they are available at all. * Agricultural production has steadily fallen so that today the country's production of most export crops is less than at independence 26 years ago. * Zaire imports 60 percent of its food. At independence, it was self-sufficient agriculturally. * There remain few passable roads around the country, preventing both the country's large copper-mining company, Gecamines, from efficiently shipping its ore and farmers from transporting produce to local markets. A Monetary Fund Test Nonetheless, Zaire, led by its autocratic president, Mobutu Sese Seko, has become a crucial test of the International Monetary Fund's formula for recovery in Africa. Four years ago, Zaire's economy had effectively collapsed. Mired in billions of dollars of debt incurred during the 1970's when the price of copper, the country's major mineral export, was booming and wallowing in Government corruption perhaps unequaled on the continent, Zaire decided to adhere to an austere regimen of financial and economic measures designed by the International Monetary Fund. Among the steps taken were an immediate raising of prices to farmers, resulting in some increase in agricultural production; a drastic devaluation of the country's currency, the zaire, which set off both a modest increase in exports and eliminated most smuggling, and a radical reorganization in the management of the country's major mining company. Government spending has been slashed, resulting principally in sharp cutbacks in Government workers, teachers being a principal example. This is one of the few examples where any country has been able to stick to I.M.F. prescriptions for three years running, a Western diplomat said. That is important, he said, because in the long pull, this is the place that has the greatest African potential. Debt Is Biggest Restraint Sticking to the I.M.F. plan has meant however, that Zaire has been forced to divert more than half its resources to meet payments on its $4.5 billion foreign debt. This in turn has permitted the Government to spend little on essential social services like health and education and on much needed public works projects like road building, electrification and clean drinking water programs for rural areas. The biggest restraint is debt, an economist said. ''If you do calculations of projected debt service, you find it a drag on the economy,'' he said. ''It is a real restraint on development. I believe debt service will be a significant drain on Zaire's budget for the foreseeable future.'' Another economist said: ''There is general agreement that whatever benefits have accrued to Zaire from the I.M.F. program, few of them are evident to the average citizen. There is no doubt in my mind that the average urban wage earner has a lower real wage than he did four years ago.'' A senior Western diplomat said: ''I think there is increasing discontent within the mind of the average Zairian who is getting no services from government. Even so, I don't think it is going to blow up. They are thinking of social programs.'' Increase in Price of Staples One result of the Government's economic programs has been a dramatic increase in the price of staples such as millet, sorghum and cooking oil over the last couple years. Transportation prices have doubled, and urban jobs are difficult to find. The main benefit of the I.M.F. program, a banker here said, is there is a great deal more certainty in the economy, more order in the economy and more external confidence. Many Western diplomats, as part of their acknowledged desire to see Zaire succeed in its compliance with the I.M.F. program and reinvigorate the economy, go out of their way to depict President Mobutu as a changed man, a leader more tolerant of his opponents and more concerned about his international image. In its 1985 report on human rights in Zaire, the State Department reported that despite the fact that no political opposition to Mr. Mobutu is permitted, there were concerted efforts by the Government to reconcile differences with political dissidents. Yet, the report said, there has been a sharply worsening human-rights situation in eastern Zaire, where low level rebel activity continues. Torture Reported in Prisons In eastern Zaire, the report charged, political killings and disappearances continued. In the rest of the country, the report said, there is little question that mistreatment of detainees, particularly beatings at arrest and during preliminary interrogation, is the rule rather than the exception."14-Dec-86,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (96%); UNITED STATES (95%); AFRICA (94%); ANGOLA (92%); NICARAGUA (79%);","PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE SEKO of Zaire, who met with President Reagan at the White House last week, is one of Africa's most durable leaders, having seized power in 1965 in the former Belgian Congo. Reagan Administration officials consider the 56-year-old Mr. Mobutu an ally, and he is said to be a channel for covert American aid to Jonas Savimbi's rebels in Angola. But Zaire's economy, despite aid from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank and $70 million a year from the United States, is in dire straits after years of mismanagement and corruption. In Washington, Serge Mukendi, a Zairean dissident, accused Mr. Mobutu of having amassed a fortune of $5 billion, more than Zaire's $4.5 billion foreign debt. And human rights advocates said his single-party Government had committed ''gross and systematic'' abuses. During his Washington visit, President Mobutu discussed Zaire's problems with Clyde Farnsworth of The New York Times. Following are excerpts from their conversation, which was conducted in French and English. Question. Are you one of the world's richest men? Is your wealth greater than Zaire's debt? Answer. I cannot live outside the budget. There is one sole budget, and there is a presidential allowance fund. Where would the money come from? It's just not possible. The budget is published every year. It is known down to the last centime. The World Bank audits us. Money can only leave in regulated amounts, fixed by accord with the I.M.F. I know that we disturb people in some ways and make them unhappy, and so they do everything they can to bring me down. The person that you call Mobutu and his country are victims of disinformation. My enemies say anything to try to bring me down. But I rule only through popular support. All the people are behind me. Human rights violations? They will say anything. But the people know the truth. I am not yet overthrown. I am here. For four years, the World Bank and I.M.F. have controlled everything. Q. Have you been asked to give money to the Nicaraguan contras? A. I don't have it to give.  Q. How close are you to Washington? A. There are 50 independent countries on the continent. A lot of them receive assistance from the U.S. Some appreciate it, some attack the U.S. My country is different. We get very little assistance from the U.S. Whether we do or not, we are friends. Q. What is Zaire's regional role?  A. Zaire and all independent countries of Africa are bound by the charter of the Organization for African Unity. However, there are countries that have quite a bit of money because they have oil. And they don't seem to honor this charter. Sometimes they get militarily involved in the affairs of other countries. I think the occupation of Chad is an excellent example. Chad asked Zaire to help, and we sent 3,000 men to Chad at two different times. Obviously, this was costly. We had to send them Coca-Cola and water by air. We also trained troops from Chad in Zaire. We don't expect thanks necessarily, but our allies should consider the fact that we actually did something like this, simply because we do not accept what Libya is doing. Don't forget that Zaire was the first country in Africa to establish normal diplomatic relations with Israel. So you can see why Zaire is a target of Qaddafi. Savimbi Connection? Q. Do American military supplies go through Zaire to Savimbi in Angola? A. It's simply not true. Q. Do you expect United States help with the I.M.F.? A. President Reagan, in front of the press, made a formal promise to that effect. First there must be a commitment to continue the I.M.F. program. We don't want to continue on the path that almost led to catastrophe. Q. What went wrong? A. We did a perfect job with our commitments for four years. The results have been very negative for our people, but quite positive for the wealthy countries. In other words, Zaire is a net exporter of capital. We have given back more than we actually received to begin with. Zaire will still honor its commitments, but it will no longer be an exporter of capital. In 1986, Zaire paid out $500 million to the international banking and financial community through the I.M.F. However, the international financial community did not give one dollar to Zaire. Seven African countries have experienced food riots in which people died. In Zaire, because of decisions between us and the I.M.F., there have been sacrifices, but no riots and no bloodshed."8-Mar-87,NIGERIA (99%); AFRICA (93%); UNITED STATES (79%);,"This is the African country that parlayed a $ 100-billion windfall into a national curse. The oil boom from 1973 to 1981 crippled the livelihoods of the farming majority, hooked city people on subsidized imports and saddled the nation with an estimated $ 18-billion debt. As Nigerians have since acknowledged, it was their own inept, corrupt government that squandered much of the oil money. So it borders on the astonishing that Nigeria, having been jolted by two military coups in the past 38 months, is now being lauded by the World Bank and the United States as a role model in Africa for free market reforms and responsible government. ""Nigeria has embarked on the most comprehensive economic adjustment program in Africa so far,"" said Ishrat Husain, resident representative here for the World Bank. ""We were never expecting them to do as much as they have done."" Nigeria's conversion from corrupt profligate to capitalist exemplar was not entirely voluntary. It was forced by last year's collapse of oil prices. Foreign debt became unpayable. Shippers stopped delivering goods. Economic activity in Africa's most populous country almost ground to a halt. But the past year's radical economic transformation here appears to be more than a last-chance maneuver to avoid default. It derives from the distinctively obdurate nationalism of the Nigerian people and the deft manipulation of that nationalism by Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, the country's military leader. ""Nigerians are so self-centered that they don't make rational decisions when the choices are imposed on them from the outside,"" said Prince Tony Momoh, minister of information and culture. ""Nigerians believe there are things superior to reasoning. Things such as pride."" It was pride that kept Nigeria from accepting a loan of $ 2.4 billion from the International Monetary Fund in 1985, the year Babangida seized power in a bloodless coup. The money probably would have prevented the debt crunch that brought this country to its knees last year. Shortly after coming to power, Babangida opened what became known as the ""Great IMF Debate."" In the debate, a uniquely Nigerian plebiscite-cum-shouting-match that was carried on in the pages of the country's daily press, it soon became clear that the public saw the IMF and its demand for economic reform as insidious instruments of greedy westerners. In addition, many Nigerians, having watched their leaders waste billions of dollars of oil money, said a loan would only increase the national debt by allowing officials to squirrel away more public funds in foreign banks. Babangida abided by the public's will and rejected the IMF loan. Then, he slowly began to put in place what western economists are calling the most rigorous free market reform package ever adopted in an African country. The package meets all of the demands of the IMF. In fact, economists here say it is far tougher than the IMF would have dared to demand. ""It has registered on a lot of people in the U.S. government that this is one of the most exciting economic reforms in Africa,"" said U.S. Ambassador Princeton Lyman. The reforms have led to a drastic devaluation of the naira, the currency whose one-to-one parity with the dollar had been considered an inviolate symbol of Nigerian pride. A dollar now buys nearly four naira. The cherished perquisites of the country's middle class, which had been subsidized by the grossly overvalued naira, fell victim to market forces. Car prices tripled. International air fares, which had been one of the best bargains in the world, doubled. School fees quadrupled for the 100,000 Nigerian families who send their children to study abroad. The reforms abolished an import licensing system that had made millionaires out of hundreds of Nigerian sharpies who used relatives and friends in the Ministry of Trade to obtain import licenses and resold them to businessmen desperate to import spare parts. Now businessmen simply import what they can pay for. Also scrapped were the country's six commodities boards, ineffectual agencies that had for years held down the price of farm produce. Abolition of the cocoa marketing board boosted the price of a ton of cocoa from $ 400 to $ 1,155. In broad outline, the reform package penalized the urban elite in favor of farmers. This is a risky business in Africa, where political power is concentrated among city dwellers. And while the reforms embraced the free enterprise theology that the IMF, World Bank and U.S. government are preaching across Africa, Babangida appears to have persuaded a large portion of the Nigerian public that his reforms are ""home-grown."" Playing to a nationalism that is more potent here than anywhere else in black Africa, Babangida said in his 1987 budget speech that ""our structural adjustment program was produced by Nigerians for Nigerians."" ""It is a political masterpiece,"" said Husain, the senior World Bank official. ""If he had done exactly the same thing under the aegis of the IMF, there would have been riots or a coup d'etat."" The economic adjustment package has so pleased defensive creditors that Nigeria has been able to quietly reschedule most of its debt. Two years ago, 44 percent of export earnings went to service foreign debt. This year, the government says, that burden has been cut in half. While international banks and western governments are delighted with the reform package, it has provoked howls of distress from the country's manufacturers. The reforms sharply reduced the number of imports banned from Nigeria, making local manufacturers vulnerable to world competition for the first time. ""The very existence of the industrial sector is seriously threatened,"" said Chief Jerome Udoji, president of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria. He warned of mass unemployment, bankruptcies and ""a return to the former colonial days of a trade economy."" Nigerians are paying a painful price for reform. Average per capita income for the country's 105 million people is 25 percent less now than in 1974. College graduates are all but unable to find professional-level jobs, according to recent press reports here. The nation's factories, according to government figures, operate at less than 30 percent of capacity. These warnings have pushed the government into some minor policy adjustments. But, according to Information Minister Momoh, the government is determined not to shelter uncompetitive local businesses simply because they are Nigerian. ""The manufacturers have not yet reconciled themselves to the fact that we are trying to force a market economy on everyone. We are telling people that if things are too expensive, don't buy them. The joy is that it hurts everyone,"" said Momoh. Homilies on free enterprise and honest government have become standard fare for Nigerian ministers in the past year. But western economists and businessmen say such rhetoric has been slow to change corrupt government contracting methods. Payoffs and kickbacks remain essential ingredients in most government spending processes, these sources say. In addition, the Nigerian government, despite its professed devotion to marketplace solutions, continues to fund expensive projects that have little chance of clearing a profit. The grandiose Adjaokuta steel works, for example, already has cost an estimated $ 3 billion. Experts say it will never make steel at prices competitive with the world market. Despite these blemishes, Nigeria has moved faster and further toward fundamental economic reform than most western observers believed possible when Babangida came to power 20 months ago. Fortunately for the government's survival, the reform has coincided with two years of bumper crops. Local prices of staple foods have fallen in the past year. Unlike most African countries facing several years of austerity as they rebuild their economies, Nigeria also has oil. Correctly managed, the oil revenue, even in a weak world market, can cushion the transition from an oil-addicted to a mixed economy, according to economists. Sustained economic recovery depends on the ability of the present government to survive and keep its reforms in place. ""If the government can sustain these changes, Nigeria could be the shining star of Africa,"" said Husain of the World Bank, which has committed about $ 1 billion in loans to support the reform package. The reforms last month earned the IMF's approval. A standby arrangement, which triggered a move by Nigeria's creditors to stretch out their loans, gives Nigeria the right to borrow up to $ 850 million from the IMF. Proud Nigeria, however, still hates the IMF. According to Momoh, Babangida's government has vowed never to borrow a penny."26-Apr-87,NIGERIA (99%); AFRICA (95%); UNITED STATES (92%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%);,"Things fall apart. That phrase, the title of a novel by Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe, describes this country's fitful passage into modernity. Nigeria is hot, crowded and noisy. Totems of its culture are hard work and armed robbery, doctorates and tribal hatred, family loyalty and fast cars. Its people heap scorn upon themselves as corrupt, inefficient and self-destructive. But even as things fall apart, Nigeria somehow has managed to meld itself into a nation. Against all odds, things come together. Out of the Biafran war, Africa's bloodiest tribal conflict, has come a lasting peace -- a feat of forgiveness remarkable in world history. Out of the berserk corruption of Nigeria's oil boom has come an economic reform package that, if sustained, will be a model for this continent. Out of the failure of two attempts at American-style democracy has emerged a moderate military regime that respects human rights, allows freedom of expression and vows to dissolve itself so that Nigeria can take another crack at democratic government. There are no guarantees these achievements will last in this fractious land. Little about Nigeria fits western images of Africa. The big game is long since dead, gone the way of the American buffalo. Hunger is rarely a problem; the soil is rich, rain is plentiful. Race is a moot issue. White people never could stand the swampy West African heat, so few settled here. Instead, there are millions upon millions of Nigerians -- 105 million is the best recent estimate. One of every six Africans lives in Nigeria, the continent's most populous nation. The country's population is growing at a rate that is among the highest in the world. In less than 50 years, according to a conservative projection, Nigeria will have 618 million people -- more than the present population of all Africa. Images of Nigeria are not nearly as romantic as those of safari Africa. The bush has been invaded by freeways, farms, universities, oil wells, slums, suburbs, breweries and mosques. But these images say far more about what Africa is and where it is going. If the world's poorest continent is going anywhere, Nigeria is likely to get there first. Nigerians themselves are not at all shy about explaining how important their country is. ""The world should see Nigeria for what it is: the country with the largest concentration of black people on earth and therefore the torchbearer for the black race,"" says Prince Tony Momoh, a wealthy businessman, influential traditional leader and minister of information in the Nigerian governmemt. Besides sheer numbers, Nigeria possesses wealth that distinguishes it from the rest of the continent. Its gross national product is bigger than South Africa's and more than half that of all black Africa. It is the world's ninth largest oil producer. At current consumption levels, Nigeria has 35 years of oil and 100 years of natural gas. Above ground, there are tens of thousands of university-trained professionals -- the country produced more college graduates in the 1970s than did all of Africa in colonial times. Africa's only Nobel laureate in literature, Wole Soyinka, is a Nigerian. The nation is the continent's fountainhead for music, art, literature and, most recently, hard-nosed economic reform. Yet the ""torchbearer"" has a habit of tripping over its own riches and burning itself badly. The oil boom of the 1970s gave Nigeria a $ 100 billion windfall. When the boom ended, the country had an $ 18 billion foreign debt, a population addicted to foreign luxuries and a farm economy that forgot how to grow food. A generation was weaned on avarice. Corruption hypnotized the national psyche. ""Big men"" ordered gold bathtubs from Europe and set fire to government buildings that contained records linking them to corruption. Lagos, the port capital, became the world's most expensive city. It became notorious for all-day traffic jams, piracy in the harbor and pandemic bribery. In 1977, as the oil money flooded in, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, then head of the military government, said that Nigeria is ""a place where people are prepared to destroy anything, to cover up any crime, if doing so promotes their economic interest or might."" And then there were the coups, the assassinations and the civil war. Six military coups in 26 years, three heads of state murdered. Gen. Murtala Mohammed was shot to death while stuck in traffic. In the 1967-70 Biafran war, nearly a million Nigerians were killed or starved to death. Like most of the countries carved out of colonial Africa, Nigeria is a geographical and historical fluke. It was created by a British colonial governor-general and named by a foreign correspondent from The Times of London (a woman who later married the governor-general). In a region larger than California, Arizona and New Mexico combined, Nigeria brought together tribes that had fought each other for centuries, made countrymen of mutually suspicious Moslems and Christians and gave the gift of citizenship to people who spoke 395 different languages. The Yoruba, of whom there are about 20 million, are one of three major ethnic groups in Nigeria. They descend from an ancient trading civilization and they dominate the country's largest cities. The sensibilities of the Yoruba have helped forge the character of Nigeria. ""When a Yoruba man says 'absolutely no,' he means 'let us negotiate,' "" explains Bade Ajuwon, a Yoruba man and director of the Institute of African Cultural Studies at the University of Ife. ""It is the negotiation, the struggle, that we want. It is our life, our mentality, our blood,"" says Ajuwon. ""The Yoruba have a proverb that says that only the thing for which you have struggled will last."" A taste for struggle has charged Nigeria with an aggressiveness unique in Africa. In a country where ""absolutely no"" means maybe, where a shouting match is a routine warm-up to a business deal, where a man doesn't know if a woman is interested until she tells him to get lost, there is a cultural logic behind Nigeria's penchant for falling apart while coming together. The history of independent black Africa is that of traditional cultures reinventing themselves to accommodate western ideas and technology. It has been a halting, confusing process. Nigeria, with its wealth, its huge pool of educated people, its aggressiveness, has reinvented itself at a higher velocity than the rest of black-ruled Africa. It has not been any smoother here, just faster. Consider the four-lane expressway that connects the country's two largest cities, Lagos and Ibadan. The white metal guard rails that separate oncoming traffic have been pulverized for more than 100 miles by cars gone out of control. The railing lies limp and useless on the median strip like long pieces of overcooked spaghetti. This twisted reminder of mayhem does not prevent traffic from traveling at between 90 and 100 miles an hour, except for cars that are capable of going faster. Every few miles on the median strip, between giant ant hills, the mangled railing and the burned-out, picked-clean skeletons of cars that didn't survive, are billboards that warn: ""Slow Down -- Speed Kills."" Freeways, built in the 1970s with the oil boom money, are a good place to watch modern urban Nigeria collide with itself and with traditional rural Africa. Market women set up shop on the freeways. They walk to work from nearby farm villages, carrying their wares on their heads and their babies on their backs. As their children play naked on the asphalt shoulders, the women sell yams and forest rats, goat meat and toothpicks, warm beer and cola nuts. Cola nuts are popular with fast drivers. The nuts, bitter with caffeine, keep them awake. This is particularly important at night when the market women go home and the armed robbers come out. Unlike much of Africa, there are lots of guns in private hands in Nigeria. Highways offer a place for people who have guns to meet people who have cars and money. Every few months, the voluble Nigerian press explodes in outrage about armed robbery. That happened early this year when the wife of former head of state Gen. Obasanjo, the leader who said his countrymen would commit any crime for money, was shot to death in traffic on a highway in Lagos. Lynda Obasanjo was ordered out of her new Peugeot 505 by four young men with guns. When she failed to move quickly, she was shot several times. She was pulled from the car and left to die in the street. The robbers took the car. Shortly after the murder, Nigeria's two largest news weeklies ran cover stories on ""Murder Incorporated"" and ""Return of the Assassins."" In a front-page story, The Sunday Sketch, a Lagos daily, wrote, ""Our society is under siege, its citizens are terrorized and dehumanized. Somebody somewhere should wake up and diffuse this siege before we all go out of our minds."" Disorienting change has been a given in Nigerian life since the country became independent in 1960. Since then, the economy has turned upside down, boomed as no African economy has ever boomed and then fizzled. Oil all but killed off the farm. Farm exports fell from 90 to 3 percent of total export earnings. The world's leading exporter of palm oil and peanuts became one of the world's leading importers of palm oil and peanuts. Oil took over. Oil money flooded the cities, and so did Nigerians. The percentage of the population living in cities doubled, from 15 to 30 percent, and the number of cities with more than a half-million people jumped from two to nine. Lagos became black Africa's biggest city, with about 4 million people. Primary school enrollment tripled. It is now close to 100 percent. Universities sprang up across the country. As recently as 1985, more than 100,000 Nigerian families had one or more children studying abroad. Each year about 35,000 Nigerian students attend American universities. A generation of Nigerians has grown up in the aggressive pursuit of western-style success. But that pursuit has not obliterated traditional African culture. In a country that comes together by falling apart, cultural dissonance is a way of life. The same daily newspapers that feature turgid analyses of structural adjustment policy also carry news bulletins about regional reduction in bride prices. Well-to-do families, whose children have doctorates from the world's finest universities, routinely appease the spirits of dead elders by placing full-page advertisements in the newspapers. The ads, which always feature a flattering photograph of the departed, remind the spirits that the living still care. Consider the ooni of Ife. Among the Yoruba, the ooni (pronounced OWE-nee) is the top oba or traditional leader. By tradition he is a direct descendant of Oduduwa, who came to earth in the town of Ife (about 150 miles northeast of Lagos) and there fathered the human race. In precolonial Nigeria, the ooni was a religious leader and a warlord. In the colonial era, he was one of many traditional leaders coopted by the British in their system of indirect rule. The current holder of the title, Oba Okunade Sijuwade Olubuse II, rides in a cream-colored 240D stretch Mercedes limousine with a purple and white license plate that says: ""Ooni of Ife."" When he appears in public, usually clad in gold brocade and slippers, an official trumpeter blasts out a loud riff. As a direct descendant of the progenitor of the human race, the ooni does not grant interviews. But he is mindful of the value of media exposure. To that end, he has retained Basha Alperin, an American woman with media experience. ""I do video for the ooni,"" explains Alperin. She shoots videotape of the ooni receiving petitioners in his palace in Ife, performing religious ceremonies (there are some 400 gods in the pantheon of the Yoruba religion) and traveling on official business. In independent Nigeria, traditional rulers such as the ooni have almost no official power. Most Yoruba are Christian or Moslem. The ooni himself is a millionaire businessman who juggles religious and entrepreneurial obligations. (His late predecessor, a church-going Anglican, was not above using his influence to line his pockets. As head of the Ife District Native Authority, he gave an exclusive concession to exploit Ife Forest to a timber company he partly owned.) It is possible, given enough cash, to buy a traditional title. Many wealthy businessmen have spruced up their image by adding ""Chief"" or ""Oba"" to their business cards. Yet Nigerians continue to respect traditional leaders, whose vague authority has survived the colonial administration, two civilian regimes and five changes of military leadership. ""No government has ever succeeded in reaching rural areas without using the traditional leaders,"" says Information Minister Tony Momoh. In the current military regime, obas -- even obas who bought their titles -- are seen by the government as legitimate spokesmen for the demands of local communities. Contradictions rest easy with Nigerians, for whom economic, social and political collisions are the stuff of everyday life. The most striking of these contradictions is the coexistence of the country's masochistic appetite for self-condemnation and its chest-thumping nationalistic pride. Titles of popular books by Nigerians include: ""Another Hope Betrayed,"" ""The Trouble With Nigeria"" and ""Always a Loser -- A Novel About Nigeria."" A recent newspaper column about national ineptitude was headlined: ""It wouldn't be Nigerian if it worked."" Nearly four years ago, the federal government came up with WAI -- the War Against Indiscipline. Unique in Africa, WAI amounted to a government admission that Nigerians are intolerably rude and messy. WAI posters were distributed throughout the country, urging people to stand in line, pick up their garbage and be nicer. In a country that blames itself for squandering billions of dollars in oil revenue, self-flagellation has become a national rite. O. Gbola Ajao, who teaches at the College of Medicine in Ibadan, wrote recently to the New Nigerian newspaper: ""Some years ago we were asking about developing a tourist industry in Nigeria. What a laugh! How will any foreigner in his right mind want to come for vacation in a place like Nigeria? Even those of us born there are always looking for one excuse or another to get out of the place."" Yet, even as they subject themselves and their leaders to withering condemnation, Nigerians have been extraordinarily intolerant of outside criticism or advice. ""Nigerians are not rational,"" says Tony Momoh, principal spokesman for the military government of Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Babangida. ""We would prefer to go hungry to being told what to do. I can't think of any other African country doing such an irrational thing. But there is more to a Nigerian than reasoning."" For more than five years, Nigeria rejected a loan from the International Monetary Fund that was conditioned on economic reform. The IMF's demand that Nigeria's currency, the naira, be devalued was popularly viewed as an imperialistic attempt to castrate the country. Other reforms, which threatened the perquisites of the politically powerful middle class, were portrayed in the local press as the sneaky schemes of greedy westerners. When the Babangida government seized power after a bloodless coup in 1985 -- as unpayable foreign debts mounted and oil revenues continued to shrink -- it became clear that prideful opposition to economic reform would bankrupt the country. Unable to overcome Nigeria's pride, Babangida outwitted it. In one of the neatest economic maneuvers in African history, the general told the IMF that Nigeria didn't want the loan. Then, as the country rejoiced in having told the IMF where to go, the military government implemented an IMF-style reform package that western economists describe as the most comprehesive on the continent. The package has led to a liberal rescheduling of foreign debts and eased Nigeria's financial crisis. The reforms, which penalize the urban elite in favor of farmers, are far stricter than officials from the IMF or World Bank say they would have dared demand. And Babangida, a former tank commander with an engaging smile, has sold them to his country as ""our structural adjustment program produced by Nigerians for Nigerians."" Thus far, with Nigeria's pride appeased, both Babangida and the reforms enjoy wide popularity. In postboom Nigeria, money is tight. With devaluation of the naira, the price of automobiles, foreign schooling and international air travel has increased three-fold. Austerity is a dreary and unavoidable fact of life. But Nigerians seem determined not to let the dreariness get out of hand. In Lagos, Nike Marinho designs and sells formal wear for weddings, birth ceremonies, funerals and installations of obas. The clothing is of traditional design, brilliantly colored, individually tailored, intricately beaded. A bargain outfit for a man or woman costs $ 300 to $ 500. An expensive outfit can run $ 1,200 or more. Marinho says her customers feel obligated to buy three or four outfits for a marriage or a funeral, affairs that usually involve several gatherings over two or three days. She acknowledges that her customers have far less money than they used to. But she says they still buy three or four outfits, often borrowing the money. ""We Nigerians are gullible for dressing up,"" she says. Olagoke Olabisi, dean of the engineering department at Lagos State University, recently purchased four new outfits to wear to the four gatherings commemorating the death of his father. The clothes cost more than Olabisi could afford, he says. Asked if anyone would notice if he were to wear an old outfit or even wear a new outfit twice, Olabisi replied: ""I would notice."""20-Nov-87,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (96%); AFRICA (92%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%);","This country is a long-suffering student in the free-market school of how not to be an economic basket case. For four years it courageously has done what the western financial experts said it must do. It has stopped wasting money on white-elephant projects and begun paying farmers prices that give them an incentive to grow food. It has lifted price controls and devalued its currency. That is one view of Zaire, supported by mountains of economic reports and many very long speeches. There is another, decidedly more cynical view, also supported by many observers here. It goes like this: Zaire is a den of unregenerate thieves. Its president and top ministers mouth the free-market lingo that the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Reagan administration like to hear, while continuing to fill foreign bank accounts with loot. No government project is begun without payoffs. Payoffs are so ubiquitous and so exorbitant that many projects are never completed. Civil servants regard extortion as a part of their job description. The murky truth about Zaire, sub-Saharan Africa's second largest country, seems to be that both of these views are true and false. Corrupt Zaire is reforming as never before; reforming Zaire is still corrupt. The IMF and World Bank were invited back to Zaire in 1983, after several years' absence, to rescue this country from unpayable debts and its own venality. Their advice, after four years, appears to have taken some of the bite out of what many Africa scholars call the ""kleptocratic"" state. But not even the western economists who designed and help implement the reforms are willing to say they see a new dawn of good government. ""If you think structural adjustment is going to turn Zaire around, you are a bit naive,"" said one western economist who monitors reform here. ""Corruption is an ethic. An economic program does not and cannot change a social malaise."" What reform has wrought here in this vast, resource-rich country is a mixed bag. Western governments have agreed not to tempt Zairian officials with more kickback-generating big projects, such as hydroelectric dams or office centers, which the country does not need and cannot afford. And yet, according to a well-informed western diplomat, a public hospital in Kinshasa was completed this year at 200 percent of cost -- 100 percent to build the hospital, 100 percent for payoffs to government officials. The government has ordered that farmers be paid prices that are high enough to motivate them to grow food. Where the prices have been paid, there has been an impressive increase in food production. And yet many middlemen across rural Zaire refuse to cut their exorbitant profits and do not pay fair-market prices to farmers. Consequently, those farmers refuse to grow more food than they need for their families. Zaire remains a food importer in spite of its enormous agricultural potential. The new minister in charge of economic policy is a brilliant, hard-working and honest technocrat who western diplomats agree is the best-qualified Zairian ever to hold such power. And yet the country's authoritarian president, Mobutu Sese Seko, recently saw fit to dispatch a government-owned DC8 airliner to Venezuela 32 times to pick up 5,000 sheep for his private farm. In the halls of the United Nations in New York and in a number of western capitals there has been a lot of sympathetic rhetoric this year about the intractable economic problems of poor African countries such as Zaire. A recent report on Africa's economic crisis appealed to western governments to help the African countries that have ""courageously"" implemented reform programs. The report said that even as these countries have tried to correct past mistakes and rebuild their economies, they have suffered ""a calamitous decline."" They have been hit, the report said, with a double whammy of unpayable debts and falling commodity prices, which have dropped to their lowest levels in 30 years. Zaire exemplifies this bad luck. The government says that in the past four years it has paid $ 2 billion in interest on its $ 6 billion foreign debt. This is a quarter of its export earnings over that period and half of the government's budget. Debt payments devoured most of Zaire's new loans from the IMF and the World Bank. In the process, Zaire, which the World Bank lists as the ninth-poorest country in the world, became a net exporter of hard currency. While this was going on, the price of the country's main export, copper, collapsed. Consumer prices rose and life for the common man in Zaire, always miserable, became more so. The country was ""risking a social explosion,"" according to a senior Zairian official. This was not what the U.S. government and other sympathetic donors had in mind when they pressed structural reform on Zaire. Accordingly, this past spring the country was given a debt reprieve. The Paris Club, a group of western creditor governments, granted Zaire six years' grace on its bilateral debts and extended payment periods for up to 15 years. The agreement was, according to an official in Zaire's Ministry of Finance, ""without precedent. No country in Africa had been treated as generously before."" Since the spring, the World Bank has promised Zaire $ 165 million in loans to support imports. The IMF has come up with another $ 142 million loan, half of which does not have to be repaid for 10 years. Zaire's bad economic fortune and its four years as a quasi-faithful student of structural reform were important factors in its receiving this money. But there was something else involved. This government has friends in Washington. ""Our main interest is making sure that this big country, as big as all of Europe, does not fall to pieces, endangering the stability of all of central and southern Africa,"" said one senior western diplomat here. The United States, which has had a long and secretive relationship with Mobutu's government, is first among those western countries that have kept Zaire from falling to pieces. Last spring, a senior IMF official in Washington reportedly resigned in protest because the U.S. government was pressing the fund to ease lending conditions for Zaire. Sources here say the U.S. government was also a major force in the Paris Club's decision in May to reschedule Zaire's debts. U.S. foreign aid to Zaire is now about $ 60 million a year, the second-highest figure in sub-Saharan Africa. The quid pro quo for American largess goes far beyond Zaire's efforts at free-market reform. It is tied to the country's western orientation and its strategic position in southern Africa. Zaire is the largest, most consistent ally of the United States in the region. The American Embassy in Kinshasa is one of the largest on the continent. U.S. military forces regularly conduct maneuvers in Zaire. According to diplomats here and officials in Washington, Mobutu's government has allowed the Central Intelligence Agency to use the southern Zairian air base of Kamina to airlift arms to rebels fighting the Marxist government in Angola. Representatives of the rebel Union for the Total Liberation of Angola (UNITA) have a secret but semiofficial status at Kinshasa's international airport. A witness saw them meet a commercial airliner there last month and usher foreign journalists around customs and immigration officials. They took the reporters to a private aircraft at the airport and flew them to the war zone in southern Angola. Mobutu has categorically denied any role by Zaire in helping to supply or support the South African- and U.S.-backed UNITA rebels. When asked what the UNITA people were doing at Kinshasa's airport, Zaire's minister of information, Mandungu Bula Nyati, insisted that they were not there. ""It is not possible. It cannot be possible,"" he said. Thomas M. Callaghy, an assistant professor of political science at Columbia University, is one of a number of specialists on Zaire who take the cynical view. He argues that the Mobutu government has adroitly used U.S. strategic interests in southern Africa to keep open the spigots of western money. At the same time, he says, it blocks substantive reforms that would cut into corrupt practices among Mobutu's inner circle of ministers. Shortly after the IMF and World Bank returned to Zaire for another try at economic reform, Callaghy wrote: ""There is little in the history of Zaire's economy . . . that would lead most observers to conclude that Mobutu is seriously undertaking substantial economic reforms. Indeed, the corruption and mismanagement which have been associated with Mobutu and his ruling elite are the very elements which keep them in power."" Economists and diplomats here who have watched the reform process firsthand in recent years say that Callaghy's bleak view is now only half right. One economist acknowledges that ""everything we try to do stops when it cuts too close to the bone"" -- meaning Mobutu, his family and his senior ministers. Another says ""the solution for getting the most out of your money is not to come here at all."" But there is a consensus among western officials directing assistance programs in Zaire that some of the broadest avenues for graft have been closed. As one diplomat said, ""Leakage in the system has gone down significantly since 1983. Reform has weeded out those who are there only to steal money."" The biggest leak for years was in the revenues of Gecamines, the state mining corporation. In the past, millions of dollars in copper and cobalt revenue disappeared without a trace. Now those revenues are accounted for in a procedure supervised by the World Bank. Besides plugging leaks in the ""kleptocratic"" system, many western donors are trying to steer clear of the system. They target small-scale aid directly at rural areas, where 70 percent of Zaire's 35 million people live. Most of the money is spent to solve the country's most acute problem, transport. ""This whole system puts limits on how far reform can go,"" said a western diplomat. ""You work with what you got."""23-Nov-87,NIGERIA (96%); AFRICA (95%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%);,"Through a car window, a Lagos ''go slow,'' or traffic jam, offers a snapshot of the diminished fortunes of Nigeria, the giant of black Africa. Five years ago, freeways here were clogged with cars bought during an oil boom. Today, traffic clogs behind cars that break down because owners cannot afford spare parts. Traffic also slows when the police set up checkpoints to look for armed robbers. Increasingly, newspapers say, these bandits come from the newly poor middle class. Some Peddle Their Wares Outside the car window, a ''go slow'' victim invariably encounters nimble young men peddling their wares to a captive market. Recent offerings ranged from videocassette tapes to bikini underwear. These are the hallmarks of Nigeria today - entrepreneurial hustle amid economic depression, a fraying social fabric amid a liberalizing political climate. With a gross national product larger than that of South Africa and a population that accounts for one in four black Africans, Nigeria has always played out African trends on a grand scale. As newly independent African countries suffered from instability, this West African nation was one of the shakiest, enduring six coups and three presidential assassinations since independence in 1960. As tribal pressures strained Africa's new nations, Nigeria was torn by the continent's most violent tribal conflict - the Biafra War of 1967 to 1970, in which about a million people died. As development became the new religion, Nigeria put its faith in oil, earning $100 billion in a decade. But oil prices crashed, and Nigeria found itself with a $21 billion foreign debt, an urban population dependent on foreign imports and a rural population that could no longer feed the nation. #2 Courses of Action ''The party was over,'' Remi Ilori, a Nigerian newspaper columnist, wrote recently. ''We awakened to the reality that we had spent colossal sums of money feasting. The tables had to be cleared - so many plates of unfinished food, so many empty bottles of beer.'' Nigeria has embarked on two courses that, once again, are being watched with interest across Africa. Both involve controlled liberalization - one in politics, the other in economics. On the political front, the President, Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, who was wounded in the Biafra War, announced plans last summer for a phased return to civilian rule by 1992. Determined to create ''a new political generation,'' the gregarious army general moved in September to ban virtually all former politicians from running for office. ''The basic idea is that Nigeria starts with a clean slate,'' said Ray Ekpu, the editor in chief of Newswatch, an independent weekly. The blanket ban met with little outcry from Nigerians. Widespread corruption marred two earlier experiences with civilian rule. A voter registration campaign in recent weeks met with so little interest that state governments threatened to withhold the salaries of civil servants who did not register. ''People still nurse the fear that politicians with their sugar-coated tongues will soon abandon them once voted into power,'' Jimoh Ojedele, a civil servant from Ibadan, said of the low turnout. The next events on the President's political calendar are local elections, which are to be held Dec. 12 on a non-party basis. These elections are to be followed by a constitutional convention, the formation of two political parties, state elections, a national census and a presidential election in 1992. ''It's going to be a rough five years for Babangida to get through,'' a senior Western diplomat here said. Some Nigerians, like Ola Balogun, a film maker, believe that Western-style democracy will not take root in an African society like Nigeria's. ''You are going to have the shadow, but not the substance,'' said Mr. Balogun, who resigned last spring from a board advising the President on Nigeria's political future. ''I think we have to fail a third time before we try something really different.'' Instead of Western-style political parties, Mr. Balogun suggested forming a parliament composed of representatives of groups that traditionally commanded respect in Africa - clans and professional guilds. Just How Many People Live in the Country? A major obstacle to creating a Western-style democracy here is expected to be the carrying out of a national census. Most estimates put the population at 105 million, but no one knows for sure. The last accepted census was in 1963. Two others were canceled because of charges of fraud. Counting heads bears directly on what may become the explosive issue in Nigeria in the late 1980's - religion. Although no one knows whether Nigeria has more Moslems or Christians, most heads of state since independence have been Moslem northerners. But recently, growing Islamic fundamentalism has strained Nigerian religious tolerance. Fundamentalist leaders have called for making Nigeria an Islamic state and for imposing sharia, or Islamic law, throughout the land. Last March, religious animosity boiled over in the north. Three mosques were desecrated and about 100 churches were burned. Stung by the destruction, Christian leaders are raising money to rebuild. ''The Christians are not going to pull out from the north,'' Anthony Olubunmi Okogie, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Lagos, vowed in an interview. ''If one hair of a Christian is plucked out, we will pluck out a Moslem hair. If care is not taken, there will be an eruption.'' Religious polarization, Nigerian commentators warn, could lead to a two-party system where one party represents the Moslem north and the other the Christian south. With the collapse of Nigeria's oil boom, the fundamentalists are believed to have increased their appeal. In early November, President Babangida threatened to silence radical religious leaders, warning, ''Religious bigotry and zealotism have not helped to provide answers to the failures of the past.'' The Facts of Life In Dollars and Cents The fate of General Babangida's political program is inextricably linked to the performance of his economic program. When he took power in a coup two years ago, Nigeria was, in the words of a recent Finance Ministry report, ''on the verge of external bankruptcy.'' Its credit sources had dried up. With the United States traditionally the largest buyer, oil has accounted for 95 percent of Nigeria's exports. But because of dropping energy prices, oil revenues fell from $25 billion in 1980 to $5.6 billion in 1986. At the same time, a million new people joined the labor pool each year. Many Nigerians and Westerners agreed that radical surgery was needed, but nationalist sentiment precluded turning to the International Monetary Fund. Instead, the Government ostentatiously rejected an I.M.F. loan, and then adopted a ''structural adjustment program'' that was far more radical that what the fund would probably have imposed. Fixed exchange rates were abolished and the value of the national currency, the naira, was allowed to float. It dropped from even parity with the dollar to the current rate of well over four to the dollar. Commodity marketing boards were abolished, allowing producer prices to rise. Production of cocoa, cotton and palm oil rebounded. ''The program is an impressive success,'' a European banker here said. As the devaluation suddenly put a true price on imported goods, middle-class Nigerians found that they could no longer afford foreign cars, shopping trips to London and university education in the United States. The next round of austerity is expected to cut deeper. Prices of gasoline, electricity, telephone service, rail travel and mail are to increase soon as Government subsidies are withdrawn. Few Nigerians deny that the present prices are low. A Nigerian pays 65 cents a minute to call London. A Briton pays $1.60 a minute to return the call. At 32 cents a gallon, gasoline here is one-tenth the price of gas in neighboring Chad. Indeed, gas stations near Nigeria's borders routinely sell three times as much as interior stations, oil industry officials say. With the cheapest jet fuel on the west coast of Africa, foreign jetliners never leave Lagos without filling up. Many Nigerians argue that bad service justifies keeping prices low. ''Lagos is roaring again,'' residents say, alluding to the noisy backyard generators that well-to-do residents fire up to cope with daily power cuts. The state power company is generating only 40 percent of capacity. Telephone service is among the worst in West Africa. Of 240,000 lines in this city of five million, 150,000 are working. Businessmen routinely resort to sending telexes or messengers to communicate across town. Although the World Bank plans to provide almost $1 billion in coming years to rehabilitate Nigerian telephone, power and water systems, the coming rate increases have prompted angry debates in the Nigeria's newspapers, among the liveliest in Africa. ''Nigeria's public utilities have a history of mind-boggling waste and inefficiency, overmanning and a corrupt bureaucracy,'' said an editorial in one daily, The Nigerian Tribune. ''In 27 years of independence, this country cannot boast reliable telephones, regular power supply, piped water.'' From the other side, another newspaper, Daily Sketch, inveighed: ''Our Structural Adjustment Program was dreamed up by foreign-based and -dominated financial institutions. Not a few Nigerians believe it is a ghastly nightmare.'' A Poor Climate For Foreign Investors A third part of the economic liberalization - foreign investment outside the oil sector - has yet to materialize. ''Unfortunately, no significant private investment, Nigerian or foreign, is yet in sight,'' Richard L. Kramer, the local director of Arthur Andersen & Company, said at a recent symposium in Lagos. ''The present Government inherited a negative foreign investment climate, which caused almost total lack of foreign investment during the entire past decade.'' According to the World Bank, Africa has the lowest rate of foreign investment of any area in the world. With its huge internal market, Nigeria should be magnet for foreign investment. But businessmen complain of a climate that scares away investors: a 50 percent limit on repatriation of profits, requirements of up to 80 percent Nigerian participation, a hostile and slow-moving bureaucracy, and poor utility service. ''You can talk to top Nigerian officials today who still think that Nigeria is an attractive place. They have no idea what it takes to bring in foreign investment,'' said an American businessman with several years' experience here. ''They have a center-of-the-universe mentality, but 100 million poor people is not a great market.'' Kalu I. Kalu, Nigeria's American-trained Planning Minister, said in an interview that the Government intended ''to create a climate conducive to foreign investment.'' But he added, ''There is always that scare: If we open up, we are going to be dominated by foreign capital.'' A 'Jerusalem' For Diaspora Blacks As Nigeria seeks to pull out of six years of unbroken economic decline, Nigerians are trying to resolve a basic psychological conflict - between the need to mesh smoothly with the rest of the world and their pride as the home to one out of five blacks in the world. Playing to Nigerians' self-image as the world's future black superpower, Bolaji Akinyemi, Nigeria's Foreign Minister, urged his countrymen earlier this year to develop a ''black bomb.'' ''Nigeria has a sacred responsibility to challenge the racial monopoly of nuclear weapons,'' he said. Since then, talk of developing a nuclear weapon has died down. Mr. Akinyemi recently relaxed in his official residence and outlined his view of Nigeria in the world. ''Some of us dream of Nigeria being to blacks in the diaspora what Jerusalem is to Jews in the diaspora,'' he said. He noted that Nigerian ambassadors - often the only representatives of black Africa in many world capitals -are instructed to reserve a third of their guest lists to ''blacks in the diaspora.'' ''We are acutely aware that if we make it in this country, it will shine on the image of the international black community,'' he said. ''If we fail, we will have dented very badly the image of the international black community.''"23-May-88,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (96%); CENTRAL AFRICA (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); AFRICA (79%);","A drop of sweat slipped onto his brow, perhaps from the heat, perhaps from nervousness, as Nakambo explained how lucky he was to find a job as a private school teacher that pays $10 a week. ''If I were still teaching at a public school, I would be earning just three dollars a week,'' he said, leaning forward in an ocher-colored armchair in his small cinder-block house in the Cite district of Kinshasa, the capital. Ten dollars a week pays for no more than his rent and the two staples in his family's diet: corn and cassava. Yet Nakambo seems better off than most of the 35 million people in this huge Central African nation. At least he can sometimes purchase extras with whatever he earns teaching French to the children of diplomats. With Africa's largest expanse of forest, 13 percent of the world's hydroelectric capacity and huge mineral deposits, Zaire has immense potential. It also has a reputation as one of the world's most egregious examples of economic mismanagement. Formerly the Belgian Congo, Zaire was self-sufficient agriculturally when it became independent in 1960. It now imports over one-fourth its food. Per capita income in Zaire, which is the size of the United States east of the Mississippi, is just $180 a year, 10 percent of the 1960 level and the eighth lowest in the world. In parts of Kinshasa, the infant mortality rate is 20 percent. More than one-third of the nation's children die before the age of five. Economists, diplomats and Western businessmen ascribe these woes to a long list of factors: rampant corruption in the Government of President Mobutu Sese Seko, estimated by the State Department to be worth $5 billion himself; a failure to maintain roads and basic services; extravagant spending on grandiose projects; wide-scale capital flight by the nation's rich, and such external factors as low commodity prices and high interest rates. While President Mobutu, who seized power in 1965, gets high marks for having woven together a nation out of 200 often-feuding tribes, his economic leadership receives far lower grades. According to the World Bank, Zaire's per capita income fell by 3.9 percent a year from 1973 to 1985. Only war-torn Nicaragua did worse. A Society Mismanaged, Repressed and Corrupted ''The political repression is nothing compared with the economic incompetence,'' one Western business executive said. But many economists and Western diplomats note that because Zaire is a repressive, one-party state, Government leaders from the President on down have felt little pressure to improve the situation. Indeed, they enrich themselves from it. Some academic studies have found that only 40 percent of Government funds go to the projects for which they are targeted. Some business executives say 10 percent is a better estimate, with Government officials pocketing the rest. Corruption is so endemic that postal workers often refuse to deliver mail unless they receive a monthly bribe, while phone company employees have been known to disconnect customers' phones unless they receive their ''metabeesh.'' Zairian generals frequently keep their subordinates' pay, and as a result some soldiers shake down private citizens to avoid going hungry. Relatives of Government officials are said to be heavily involved in diamond and ivory smuggling. ''The corruption pattern starts at the very summit of the system,'' said Crawford Young, a University of Wisconsin professor and co-author of ''The Rise and Decline of the Zairian State.'' ''The extent of Zaire's corruption may not be unique, but it is a leading practitioner of the art.'' President Mobutu, whose father was a cook and whose mother was a hotel maid, has 11 homes in Zaire and reportedly owns a 16th-century castle in Spain, a 32-room palace in Switzerland, luxurious residences in Paris and on the French Riviera, and lavish homes in Belgium and the Ivory Coast. He often sends military planes to South Africa to pick up exotic plants and to South America to pick up sheep for his palace in Gbadolite, which has been dubbed ''Versailles in the jungle.'' When confronted with accusations of corruption, the 57-year-old Mr. Mobutu says he is a victim of disinformation and adds that the United States and other countries have corruption, too. ''Everyone is sitting here watching this country deteriorate rapidly,'' said one Western diplomat. ''The thing that needs to be pressed is corruption; but if you press too hard, then you start to destabilize things, and the Big Man doesn't want that.'' Mr. Mobutu has repeatedly blamed civil strife and such external factors as weak commodity prices for the the country's falling standard of living. Declining copper and coffee prices did, in fact, take a serious toll. So did the high interest rates of recent years, which significantly increased Zaire's payments on its now $7 billion foreign debt. Pain Without Gain: A Fling With the I.M.F. The economic situation and debt burden grew so serious that Zaire rescheduled its debt numerous times and repeatedly invited the International Monetary Fund to help manage its economy. In 1983, working with the I.M.F., Zaire slashed its budget deficit, brought down its inflation rate to 20 percent from 100 percent and devalued its currency. Zaire won praise for trying to put its economic house in order. But the measures could not bring instant success. Although price controls on farm goods were lifted to encourage production, for example, a lack of passable roads to ship their goods to market made it unwise for many farmers to plant larger crops. Other measures exacted a heavy toll. The Government laid off 40,000 teachers, slashing education spending to 8 percent of the budget from 24 percent. Wage increases for civil servants trailed far behind inflation, pushing them to seek bribes. ''There are the very rich and the very poor, and austerity plans certainly make things worse for the poor,'' said one banker. In late 1986, Zaire renounced its austerity program, asserting that the $500 million it repaid each year was too painful and was causing a net outflow of funds. Within months, the budget deficit skyrocketed and inflation was back to 100 percent. This decimated purchasing power: the currency, called the zaire, traded at 16 cents in 1983 but is worth a little more than half a cent today. The nation's rich deposited their money in European banks to prevent the emaciation of their holdings. As a result, domestic investment plummeted. Foreign investors were frightened off by inflation and the fact that they pay too high a share of taxes because Zairian businesses often bribe their way out of paying. After coming under heavy criticism from the West, Zaire agreed again last spring to follow an I.M.F. program, but only after winning more favorable repayment terms. Zairian officials and executives complain, however, that since they are plagued by low commodity prices their nation cannot regain economic momentum without substantial debt forgiveness. Today, whatever optimism economists and diplomats felt in 1985 has given way to a deep pessimism that it will take years before Zaire can creep meaningfully forward. There is one bright spot, in the view of many diplomats and foreign bankers: President Mobutu has named a respected economist, Sambwa Pida Mbagui, former head of the Bank of Zaire, to be Prime Minister. Many diplomats say President Mobutu, who often changes prime ministers every six months, has never had a man of such ability as prime minister. Nevertheless, one Western businessman, echoing the views of many others, said: ''If Sambwa really institutes reforms, he will step on so many toes that the high-level jackals will tear out his hide and he'll go down, too.'' An Economy Shorn Of Expertise Many of Zaire's economic woes began in 1973 when Mr. Mobutu launched ''Zairianization,'' under which European-owned businesses were seized and given to Zairians for token compensation. Many of the businesses went to the President's family and cronies, and within two years, Zaire's economy had shrunk by 15 percent. The new owners often had no idea how to manage their holdings. When President Mobutu was forced in 1975 to invite the Europeans back to run the businesses, there was often not much left to run. Another major cause of Zaire's debt burden was President Mobutu's ''edifice complex.'' In downtown Kinshasa, he built a steel-and-glass skyscraper, dubbed the World Trade Center, much of which remains empty. He ordered construction of the $250 million Maluku steel mill, even though Zaire has little iron ore. The mill closed soon after it opened when Zairian officials discovered that they could import steel for half the cost of producing it. The biggest project was a power line running 1,000 miles from the Inga Dam east to the vital Shaba region, whose copper and cobalt produce 60 percent of Zaire's export earnings. The power project was supposed to cost $200 million, but its final price tag, inflated by graft, approached $1 billion. The line was built even though many advisers said it would have cost less than $70 million to erect a new dam in Shaba, but Mr. Mobutu wanted the line so he could cut off all power to often-rebellious Shaba, once called Katanga, if it were to cause trouble again. ''The main obstacle to development is the state,'' said one Zairian political scientist. ''As long as we don't have democracy, we can't control investment projects like the Inga-Shaba line because there is no one to stop the Government from doing foolish things.'' Development experts say Zaire would have been far wiser to spend money to maintain the roads and promote agriculture. In that way it might have been able to remain self-sufficient in food and to reduce its heavy dependence on mining. Road maintenance has been so abysmal that the 1,100-mile drive from Zaire's Atlantic coast to its eastern border, which once took two days, now takes three weeks and is often impossible during the rainy season. ''Transportation is a very, very difficult problem,'' said Dennis Chandler, director of the United States Agency for International Development office in Zaire. ''There's not a whole lot of priority put on maintenance, and that's a weak link in a country this size.'' Sugar-Free Existence: The 'I-Get-By' Life When the teacher Nakambo was asked how he could pay for electricity and clothes, he responded: ''Je me debrouille.'' Probably the most popular phrase in French-speaking Zaire, it means, ''I get by, I manage, I improvise.'' In this nation of debrouillards, getting by means forgoing any number of niceties. If Nakambo could afford it, he would pay the 12 cents to take a bus to work, but instead he walks the four miles each way. Before the latest spurt in inflation, breakfast consisted of bread and sugared tea. ''Sugar we no longer buy. It's too much of a luxury,'' said Nakambo, who did not want his full name disclosed. His house differs little from tens of thousands of others in Kinshasa's endless Cite district: some thrown-together cinder block walls, a sheet of corrugated metal above, a few plaster partitions within. They create a dark, modest living space cluttered with a 20-year-old refrigerator, an old sewing machine, several chairs and a sofa. The eight-by-ten-foot windowless kitchen doubles as a bedroom for his five children. Nakambo's wife, Malaika, occasionally uses the sewing machine to make children's dolls in richly-colored African wraps, which she tries to sell to foreigners. She also used to sell ices to schoolchildren, putting sugared water into long, thin plastic sacks and freezing them. But she can no longer afford sugar and the refrigerator needs a new motor, which she says would cost about $100. While his family scrapes by, Nakambo's biggest fear is of serious illness. A few months ago, a cousin had to have her appendix removed. The operation and hospital stay cost $100, equal to three months' income for many Kinshasans. ''You have to pay off the guard just to be allowed into the hospital,'' Nakambo said. ''Then you have to pay off the nurses to make sure you're looked after. They have to survive too.''"13-Oct-88,AFRICA (99%); KENYA (92%); UNITED STATES (79%);,"Post reporter Blaine Harden, writing from Nairobi last Saturday, said that Africa must share the blame for its own poor economic performance. Harden's analysis refers to the ""growing clamor over culpability in Africa's decline,"" and implies that the industrial nations should not be so ready to accept responsibility. He points out that government interference, inefficiency and corruption in Africa have discouraged foreign investors -- and reduced the very flow of resources the Africans claim is their due. Some of the clamor Harden refers to took place recently in New York, where the United Nations has been reviewing an international recovery effort designed to remedy the deteriorating economic situation in Africa. According to the Africans and the United Nations, things have gotten worse in the past two years, not better, because the industrial countries have failed to live up to their promises of more financial assistance to the African nations. The Africans maintain that they have performed on their side of the deal with the donor countries -- a deal made back in 1986 at a special session of the U.N. General Assembly -- by undertaking dangerous economic reforms. Conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank closed down inefficient government-run agricultural organizations and monopoly businesses and eliminated subsidies. Many Africans have lost their jobs as a result. Consumer prices have risen, especially in the politically volatile cities, where, in several countries, riots have broken out. Africans complain that the donor and creditor nations promised to find relief for Africa's foreign debt burden, but it continues to grow to the point where, in many cases, debt service payments exceed foreign assistance. And net resource flows from the industrial nations to Africa have actually declined since 1985, although they were slightly up last year. Thus, in spite of reform, Africa's per capita gross domestic product continues to fall. Part of the original 1986 understanding was that the Africans would not insist on bringing global debt relief plans and commodity pricing schemes into the recovery program, but would instead undertake reforms in return for a best-efforts promise by the industrial countries to increase foreign aid and deal effectively with debt on a case-by-case basis. Some Africans now want to go back to their demand for a global debt solution and a better deal on their commodity exports. In addition, many Africans want to do away with the strict conditions applied by the IMF and the World Bank, on the grounds that these donor-imposed economic reforms have unacceptable political consequences. Are the Africans right? Did we renege on our promises? Or are the Africans themselves as much to blame? The truth is that we did what we said we would do -- the best we could. It just hasn't been good enough. So, too, the Africans did what they said they would do -- engage in economic reform. It just hasn't worked as well as we all hoped it would. The fact is that we have slightly increased net resource flows to the continent, and a series of debt relief measures has been undertaken, ranging from the Baker plans, through the expanded lending by the Bank and the Fund to the proposals at the Toronto Summit. There is movement on the debt front, and the Africans should be pleased with the general direction, if not with the immediate results. Rhetoric aside, there does seem to be a building consensus on the kinds of next steps that both Africans and their industrial partners should take. Both agree that significantly more resources for economic growth must be liberated from the debt trap; after the U.S. election, progress might be made on this front. Both agree that concessional assistance should increase; the World Bank and Japan are the most likely sources. And no one will quarrel with the proposition that there is much the Africans themselves can do to improve the investment climate. More importantly, the beginnings of a consensus on conditionality and on the nature of economic reform seems to be in the making. Many believe that some of the economic reforms have tried to go too far too fast. We need to get back to basics in Africa -- more emphasis on fiscal integrity, mobilization of African resources for development, agricultural reform and -- to buffer political repercussions and address urgent social needs -- more spending on health, education and employment programs. These are the right directions. Let's stop blaming each other for less-than-perfect performance and get on with the economic recovery of Africa. The writer is a former deputy assistant secretary of state for African affairs."20-Nov-88,NIGERIA (93%); BRAZIL (79%); GERMANY (55%);,"Even the winners have lost. Fifteen years after the explosion of oil prices in 1973, the price of petroleum in real terms is not a lot higher than it was just before. But the damage wreaked is far from over. Several countries which thought they had, by divine indulgence, become rich forever are still suffering from the binge. Others are falling ever more hopelessly into debt. Piecemeal efforts have been made to patch the system enough to keep goods and services flowing, but there is still no overall scheme for a reasonably expanding balance to meet the world's needs. Bumbling through has been possible because those responsible did learn something from the Depression about the wages of economic war. The lesson remaining to be learned is that abrupt upheaval with attempts to establish a ''new world economic order'' winds up hurting all. There is no longer any substitute for deliberate cooperation among the world's nations, in economic as well as in security, political and environmental affairs. Helmut Schmidt, the former West German chancellor, startled African officials meeting in Nigeria recently when he said never again could they expect the torrents of capital that poured out of the industrial world in the 1970's. They were created by the sudden shift in terms of trade, flooding oil producers with money turned over to Western banks for investment, wasted, or to a lesser extent used for their own development. That in turn produced the vast third-world debt crisis, which also afflicts some oil producers now, Mexico and Nigeria among them. Top Nigerian economic officials say ruefully that, after all, their country would have been better off if they had never struck it so rich on oil. ''It is like the man who wins a lottery and builds a castle,'' said one. ''He can't maintain it, and then has to borrow or move out.'' Expectations destroy prudence, too-easy money promotes profligacy and corruption, and there is no chance to win again. What remains is ''structural readjustment,'' the most ominous phrase in the third world now. It is International Monetary Fund jargon for the imposed austerity that is undermining the fabric of third world societies as they try to recover and reorganize production. Brazil's fragile democracy is an example of the strain that may be turning into too much to bear. The collapse of commodity prices as a consequence of the industrial world's painful efforts to deal with inflation and then recession after the oil crisis will probably never be turned around. Trade patterns were changed. New materials have been developed. The third industrial revolution has cut dependence on the traditional raw materials that provided livelihood and hopes for development in the nonindustrial world. The lucky ones have been the ''newly industrialized countries,'' which were able to make the best of cheap labor, determined management, with no illusions of either massive aid or sudden unearned wealth while markets were wide open and consumer appetites inflated. Those coming later aren't likely to find the same advantageous conditions. The U.S. imagines it has got over the hump, but it is living on borrowed money. Western Europe knows it has not yet succeeded. Its biggest problem remains unemployment, a chronic average of about 10 percent which masks much higher figures in some countries, notably Spain. Decline of some industries was inevitable, but the rate that made it so hard to absorb was aggravated by the oil crisis. The country most devastated was the one most eager to raise and raise and raise the golden stream - Iran. Other factors contributed, but it was above all the frenzy brought by so much oil money that provoked the Iranian revolution. That led to the Iran-Iraq war and the ruination of both countries. Partly because of the distortions in both rich and poor countries, partly as well because the idea was never acceptable to most people, the proposal of zero growth as a way to make the world cleaner and happier was soon dumped. The Club of Rome had some points, but not the right ones. Now the effort has to be for a new balance, but one more accommodating to the diversity of needs. New frictions are accumulating between knowledge that neglect of the environment is by no means benign and urgent yearning for continuation of the growth stimulated by petrodollars and then stunted. Energy is a key factor. Extensive studies are needed on economic costs that must be included in development plans to assure environmental protection. As the world moves on into a surprising new period, the notion of security must include economic relations."26-Apr-89,KENYA (95%); AFRICA (94%); UNITED STATES (92%); EASTERN AFRICA (92%);,"The Kenyan government has banned an aggressive business magazine that for two years broke an unwritten rule of journalism in black Africa. The Financial Review did not play it safe. It published detailed articles about alleged corruption and mismanagement at high levels in the Kenyan government. The weekly, with a circulation of about 15,000, named officials allegedly involved in illegal or unethical business practices. It focused on what the magazine's 36-year-old owner and editor, Peter Kareithi, described as ""very serious flaws in national economic management."" The banning order comes at a delicate time for the international image of Kenya, a poor, debt-burdened East African country whose economy is dependent on tourism and international aid. In Washington, the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa is marking up legislation that conditions future U.S. aid to Kenya on State Department certification that human rights -- including freedom of the press -- are respected. Proposed aid for next year totals $ 70 million. Pending low-interest loans and grants from the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Japan, totaling more than $ 380 million, are conditioned on Kenya's following through on promises for free-market economic reform. The reputation of this closest ally of the United States in East Africa has been impugned by well-documented reports of human rights abuses, including police torture of political dissidents. A prominent human rights lawyer, Gibson Kamau Kuria, who sued the government on behalf of torture victims, was detained for nine months and had his passport taken away. Last week, Rep. David Obey (D-Wis.), who chairs a House subcommittee on appropriations, vowed to cut off all aid to Kenya if Kuria was not given back his passport. In the Financial Review case, a minister of state for internal security, who works in the office of President Daniel arap Moi, released a document here Friday that said the magazine ""is declared to be a prohibited publication."" The document did not explain why. The banning order came three days after Attorney General Matthew Muli criticized the magazine for ""carrying mischievous stories implying that the government has taken over and nationalized"" the property of Kenya's wheat millers. Muli demanded an ""unconditional"" retraction and apology. Editor Kareithi said, ""Much as we wish to comply with your request for apology,"" the facts of the government's actions against the milling companies gave him ""difficulties"" in knowing how to do so. The story focused on sweeping new regulations published April 10 in the official Kenya Gazette. The regulations empower the government-owned grain board to commandeer private grain storage facilities ""at such times as the board may direct, and at such remuneration as the board may determine."" The Financial Review quoted several outraged milling company executives. One asked: ""What is the world coming to? How can a parastatal [government agency] which has never been known for its efficiency and which has been a constant source of misery to farmers be given such sweeping powers as to control the nerve center of the milling industry?"" Governmental protests last week against the magazine article did not dispute its facts. The minister for supplies and marketing, William ole Ntimama, said the article was ""written by people who have no interest of this country at heart."" The assistant minister for national guidance and political affairs, Shariff Nassir, said, ""Although there was press freedom in Kenya, editors should not be left to write whatever they wanted."" Kareithi bought the review for $ 37,000 in 1986. In an interview, he said, ""We must have known from the beginning what was going to happen, but we were encouraged by government statements about the responsible exercise of freedom of the press. We wanted to demonstrate that it was possible for a Kenyan-owned publication to take bold steps. We wanted to encourage other Kenyans."" Kareithi was picked up by police in December and interrogated for a day about stories that displeased the government. The editor said he apologized and returned to work. ""The past year has literally been a nightmare for me and my staff. When we sat to discuss a cover story, most of our discussions were not about how to get information, but rather how to report it objectively and honestly without getting in trouble,"" Kareithi said."30-Jun-89,"ANGOLA (96%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (94%); UNITED STATES (93%); CENTRAL AFRICA (92%);","President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire met with President Bush and members of Congress today and was confronted with expressions of concern about reports of human rights abuses in his Central African country. But Mr. Mobutu was also praised as a peacemaker whose diplomacy was helping bring an end to 14 years of civil war in neighboring Angola. Mr. Mobutu defended Zaire's record on human rights, insisting that abuses had been overstated by critics. In a report this year, the State Department said that freedom of speech, freedom of the press and other rights were ''substantially circumscribed'' in Zaire. It said that ''many human rights abuses stem from endemic corruption'' among Zairian officials. After meeting with Mr. Bush at the White House, Mr. Mobutu said his country had taken steps to improve the protection of human rights. As a result, he said, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights recently removed Zaire from the list of nations subject to special monitoring. 'Incidental Mishaps' Mr. Mobutu seemed to say that any violations of human rights were ''incidental mishaps.'' In a departure ceremony outside the White House, he said, ''Zaire can be ranked among those countries which observe the rule of law, not to be confused or mistaken with any incidental mishaps that are attributable to an administration or to individuals.'' President Mobutu had tea this afternoon with members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. A person who attended the meeting said that he ''became annoyed, angry and aggressive and delivered long-winded rebuttals'' when members of Congress criticized his record on human rights. Mr. Bush spent 2 hours 15 minutes with the Zairian leader. An Administration official said the President ''raised the issue'' of human rights and expressed concern about ''problems and deficiencies'' in Zaire's record. The President did not mention Zaire's human rights problems in his public farewell statement to Mr. Mobutu. He praised the African leader for helping to bring about a cease-fire in Angola. Leaders of the Angolan Government and rebel forces agreed to the truce last week when they met at Mr. Mobutu's country estate. The Central Intelligence Agency has worked closely with Mr. Mobutu for years. Angolan military commanders and Western diplomats in Zaire say the agency sent weapons through Zaire to the Angolan guerrilla forces led by Jonas Savimbi. Long Incumbency Mr. Mobutu has been President of Zaire since 1965 and was recorded as having won 99 percent of the vote in the last election, in 1984. Mr. Bush and Mr. Mobutu promised that there would be closer economic ties between the two nations. They exchanged paperwork for a treaty to encourage increased American investment. Zaire has been plagued by allegations of corruption and mismanagement. But Mr. Bush today praised Mr. Mobutu's recent commitment to an economic austerity program as a condition for receiving assistance from the International Monetary Fund. Richard A. Boucher, the deputy spokesman for the State Department, said that American officials regularly discussed human rights problems with Zaire. He said that ''President Mobutu has recently taken a number of steps to correct abuses'' of human rights. A study by the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa said that Zaire was still ''very repressive.''"14-Dec-89,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (95%); UNITED STATES (79%); BELGIUM (55%);","Western economists here say this country's long-moribund economy is showing promising signs of recovery. Since January, Zaire, after years of mismanagement and political instability, has devalued its currency, put a brake on Goverment spending, trimmed civil servants from its bloated bureaucracy and increased tax revenues by tightening collection procedures. These measures, and a perceived new readiness by Zairian officials to tackle their enormous problems with politically unpopular remedies, prompted the International Monetary Fund to assess Zaire's economic performance so far this year as positive and satisfactory. ''The program has been implemented effectively,'' said John Calvin Williams, the I.M.F. representive here, ''and it has already begun to bear fruit in a number of areas.'' For example, Mr. Williams said, since March Zaire's inflation rate has averaged 2.5 percent a month, down from nearly 9 percent a month in 1988. At the same time, he said, the spread between the official and the parallel market exchange has been been reduced to less than 10 percent. For the first six months of this year, revenues from taxes and export receipts have exceeded expenditures, producing a small budget surplus, the first since Zaire gained independence from Belgium nearly 30 years ago. ''In this context, it's a fairly remarkable turnaround,'' said an African diplomat here, noting Zaire's near-legendary reputation for mismanagement, corruption and wasteful spending. The optimism, however, is hedged with caveats. Western and Zairean economists and bankers say it is too early to well whether Goverment officials will stay the course. Although Zaire's economic perfomance this year has been impressive, the statistics have yet to be translated into better living conditions. Per capita income in Zaire, which is the size of the United States east of the Mississippi, is just $150 a year. Analysts here are also concerned about whether the Government will be able to restrain spending in 1990, since it has already committed itself to a number of projects, notably constructing housing and convention space for a summit meeting of French-speaking nations. Costly celebrations are also likely next year on the 30th anniversary of Zaire's independence, the 25th anniversary of the governing party's founding and President Mobutu Seso Seko's 60th birthday. In the early 1980's, Zaire's economy effectively collapsed. The causes were diverse: a slump in the price of copper, agricultural neglect and, by many accounts, seemingly endemic corruption. After some hesitation, Mr. Mobutu threw in his lot with fundamental economic changes prescribed by the international monetary fund and carried out the program with dictatorial powers. He stuck to the I.M.F.'s stringent guidelines, including a string of devaluations. The value of the zire, the nation's currency, is an eighth of what it was in 1979. ''We were the I.M.F.'s best pupil,'' Pay-Pay Wa Syagasighe, the head of Zaire's central bank, said recently. In 1986, however, Zaire abruptly abandoned the program, protesting that it had become a net exporter of capital to Europe and the United States. ''The I.M.F. programs cost us $2 billion in outflows against only $1 billion in inflows,'' President Mobutu complained in an interview last fall. Within months, however, the budget deficit skyrocketed, and inflation was back to 100 percent. Foreign investors began to flee. Last May, after several months of protracted negotiations, the Government signed a new $253 million credit agreement with the I.M.F., under which it again committed itself to an economic reform program. Analysts here say they have been especially impressed by Zairian efforts to crack down on fraud and abuse in the customs service. An economist with an international assistance agency said, ''Everyone is being made to pay customs duties and taxes now, even the previously untouchable political elite, and that has never happened before.''"10-Jan-90,"AFRICA (99%); UNITED STATES (95%); KENYA (93%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (93%); CANADA (92%); LATIN AMERICA (79%); GHANA (79%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (79%); FRANCE (78%); GERMANY (78%);","The United States today formally agreed to forgive all economic-assistance loans to Kenya, as part of an effort to give economic relief to Africa, including some of the continent's poorest countries. The debt-relief effort, which was announced last July, is also aimed at rewarding African countries that have started to tighten their belts to improve their weak economies. The United States Ambassador here, Smith Hempstone, signed an agreement that covered $44.7 million of Kenya's total outstanding debt of $175 million. The remaining $130 million will be forgiven over the next two years, if Kenya adheres to an economic reform program reached with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Total of $735 Million In all, the United States has pledged to cancel debts of $735 million owed by 12 sub-Saharan African countries. The per-capita incomes in those countries range from a low of $150 in Zaire to a high of $390 in Ghana. The debt forgiveness reflects continuing concern about declines in Africa's well-being. ''Over all, Africans are almost as poor today as they were 30 years ago,'' the World Bank said in a major report in November. Of the 44 countries of black Africa, more than half are severely in debt and have structurally weak economies, the World Bank said last month in an assessment of world debt. The economies are weak because of heavy dependence on volatile commodities, like coffee and tea, for exports; rapidly growing populations, and very little investment. Many of the economies have also been buckled by official corruption. Differs From Reagan Policy The decision to forgive the United States' debt is part of a policy adopted by the Bush Administration last year to do more to help the poorest countries. The Reagan Administration had refused to go along with some other Western nations, notably Britain, France, Canada and West Germany, which began canceling the official debts of sub-Saharan countries after an economic summit meeting in Toronto in 1988. The Reagan Administration chose instead to give the countries more time to pay. By the end of 1988, the foreign debt of sub-Saharan Africa was about $140 billion, the World Bank reported. In comparison with Latin America's debt of hundreds of millions of dollars, the sub-Saharan debt is relatively small. But unlike the Latin debt, much of which is owed to commercial banks, Africa's is mostly owed to governments and multilateral agencies like the World Bank. Economists have pointed out that the annual cost of servicing Africa's debt is about $12 billion. As poor as it is, Africa continues to be a net exporter of resources, paying more in debt service than the total of what it receives in foreign aid and earns from commodity exports, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. Don Harrison, deputy chief of the Planning Analysis and Research Division at the United States Agency for International Development, said that servicing the debt consumed much of the foreign exchange needed to purchase goods and services and supply investment capital for economic growth and development. Kenya Among the Better Off Of the 12 countries where Washington is forgiving its loans, Kenya is one of the most prosperous, with a per-capita income of $330. But even so, Western donors including the United States have expressed concern at the Kenyan Government's growing reliance on foreign aid to pay for spending and budget deficits. The donors have also informed the Kenyans that the Government is seeking too many large-scale commercial loans from abroad for items like aircraft for the national airline and a 60-story office tower. The United States is canceling its economic loans for countries including Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Malawi and Madagascar. Some of the loans, dating back 25 years, when Kenya obtained independence from Britain, were granted largely for spending on public works."31-Mar-90,"FRANCE (99%); AFRICA (98%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (94%); COTE D'IVOIRE (93%); GABON (92%); CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC (79%); EUROPE (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (79%); GERMANY (79%); SENEGAL (79%); NIGER (79%); ASIA (79%); CHAD (79%); EASTERN EUROPE (53%);","France is sending signals that it intends to reduce its role in its former possessions in sub-Saharan Africa and that it expects governments in those countries to move toward greater democracy and respect for human rights. Three decades after granting formal independence to its sub-Saharan African empire, France is trying to shed its image as an all-knowing, often generous and sometimes interfering Big Brother in favor of more distant and traditional diplomatic relations, according to officials and analysts. ""Now France is fundamentally getting rid of the colonies in favor of normal state-to-state relations,"" said a French official here. ""We still have historic responsibilities here and thus seek no sharp break."" In keeping with this new image, France was careful to appear no more than a concerned bystander when demonstrations and strikes recently swept through former colonies as economically, politically and geographically diverse as Gabon, Niger, Senegal and Ivory Coast. Although French troops still are stationed on African soil, they have been non-interventionist, unlike when they restored overthrown President Leon M'Ba in Gabon in 1964, deposed Emperor Bokassa in the Central African Republic in 1979 or helped stop foreign invasions of Chad and Zaire, the analysts said. Government corruption, human rights violations and economic mismanagement in its former colonies have helped weaken the close links that France maintained in these countries to boost its image as a world power and ensure the survival of French as an internationally important language. The policy, which critics called neo-colonialist, appears to have outlived its usefulness for the French, who long justified their hands-on approach by contrasting the benefits of convertible currency and law and order backed by French army garrisons to the economic disorder and violence elsewhere in Africa. Events in Eastern Europe and the prospect of German unification provided an additional rationale for shifting France's limited resources nearer to home -- or to Asia with its promise of better return on investment. French Prime Minister Michel Rocard has said that ""France has no moral right nor political intention to drop Africa,"" and other French officials have echoed his statement. They also have hinted that greater democracy -- and greater respect for law -- are overdue in France's former possessions in Africa. With African agricultural exports sagging and French business retrenching, leaders of these countries have few illusions about Paris's assurances that private investment will take the place of what was once the world's highest per capita aid program. That program brought with it tens of thousands of French officials, businessmen and technicians. With the passing of the Cold War, African leaders are less able to invoke China, Cuba, the Soviet Union or the United States as competitors to France for influence in Africa. In a recent op-ed article in the Paris newspaper Le Monde, a French African specialist criticized French officials for keeping silent about well-documented abuses in the former colonies ""for fear of endangering delicate bilateral relations."" He argued that French aid ""had reached the ultimate point of perversion"" by ""maintaining crazy regimes and parasitical structures"" that have become ""the surest obstacles to development."" France also has learned the usefulness of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. French officials have discovered that IMF demands for austerity measures can be conveniently invoked to refuse the appeals from African leaders for more funds that for three decades often were answered in Paris."15-Jul-90,AFRICA (98%); KENYA (94%); ZAMBIA (94%); ETHIOPIA (92%); COTE D'IVOIRE (92%); EUROPE (79%); UGANDA (79%); GABON (79%); ZIMBABWE (79%); EASTERN EUROPE (57%);,"When thousands of Zambians rushed onto the streets of Lusaka last month to celebrate what they thought was a successful overthrow of their longtime President, Kenneth D. Kaunda, they were expressing what citizens in many parts of Africa have been saying more and more: Africa's original big men have been around too long. Corruption, mismanagement and authoritarian rule appear to be catching up with the aging leaders as news spreads about liberalization in Eastern Europe and economic conditions get palpably worse at home. At the Organization of African Unity's annual meeting in Addis Ababa last week, there were polite noises about the need for democracy in Africa, where only about half a dozen countries would pass even an undemanding democracy test. The new chairman of the 51-nation group, President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, was so bold as to state that democracy was essential for the running of a modern state. But the 46-year-old Mr. Museveni, who has held power only four years and is an unusually engaging performer on the African stage, provides a rare counterpoint to his aging colleagues, many of whom stayed away from the gathering to deal with political troubles at home. The challenges to the old guard stem largely from uniformly depressing economic conditions that affect all segments of society - the young, who make up most of the fast-growing populations, and the middle-aged and elderly, who are weary of stale polemics. In the 1980's, per capita income in most of Africa fell drastically. Expenditures on health, housing and education dropped as governments spent large amounts on armies and condoned corruption in state-run enterprises, and as heavy-handed leadership allowed for little development of a new generation to take over. Riots over food prices in Zambia, which preceded the failed coup attempt, were not the only ones in Africa this year. There have been similar signs of unrest in the Ivory Coast and Gabon. In some countries, particuarly Kenya, where the leaders of the unofficial opposition and nine supporters were arrested July 4 and 5 and are still in detention, calls for multiparty democracy have become a rallying cry to open the political process. Closed Parties In many African one-party states, the party is a closed society that comes to power in rigged elections. Those who fear multiparty states on the grounds that they foster tribalism say Mr. Kaunda and President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya could satisfy the demands for greater political participation by opening up the one party. But so far there have been few signs of that. In Mr. Kaunda's case it has been 26 years since he took charge at the birth of Zambia, formerly Northern Rhodesia. He has ruled with a fatherly benevolence that brooks little criticism, using the United National Independent Party as his instrument. Over the northern border in Zaire, Mr. Kaunda's presidential peer is Mobutu Sese Seko, installed in 1965, five years after independence from Belgium. In May, Mr. Mobutu's Government responded to protests at a university in Lubumbashi by sending troops to the campus. Belgian officials in Brussels say the troops turned off dormitory lights and knocked door to door, killing in cold blood more than 50 students. While Mr. Mobutu has promised that three new political parties will be allowed to operate in Zaire, most diplomats and Zaireans have little illusion that the political spectrum will be meaningfully broadened. East of Zambia, the octogenarian Hastings Kamuzu Banda has presided with unbridled authoritarianism over Malawi, formerly British Nyasaland, since independence in 1964. So far, there has been no widely reported unrest in Malawi - in part, diplomats believe, because the population lives in dread of the police. In the Ivory Coast, President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who has held power since 1960 and was confronted with street riots earlier this year, has indicated that he will name a successor and step down, but his statements have been vague. In May, President Omar Bongo of Gabon, who has governed for 23 years but has now decided to allow political parties to form, suffered the indignity of seeing 1,000 French troops sent to his country to protect French residents in the wake of riots. The coup attempt in Zambia left more uncertainties, rather than fewer, about that country's future. Mr. Kaunda's personal reputation is not in complete tatters - ''He has kept us in peace for a long time,'' said a Zambian teacher - but urban workers say they cannot afford the doubling of the price of the basic foodstuff, corn meal, that Mr. Kaunda recently annnounced. For many years, Mr. Kaunda has subsidized food prices with revenues from copper, but copper prices have fallen. Zambia's international debt has ballooned to more than $7 billion, reported to be the highest per capita in the world. Mr. Kaunda broke with the International Monetary Fund four years ago, but now has finally swallowed its hard economic adjustment programs, which include the rise in food prices. Mr. Kaunda has agreed to hold a referendum on Oct. 17 on whether to allow more than one party, but diplomats say it is open to question how fair the vote will be. Mr. Kaunda has called those who favor a multiparty system ''wild dogs'' and has warned that more political parties would lead to ''tribalism.'' Zambians, from businessmen to workers, say they can't be sure what will happen next. The army's top ranks have been well looked after by Mr. Kaunda, but there are reports of dissatisfaction with pay by junior officers and enlisted men. And if Mr. Kaunda sticks to the I.M.F. program, a Western diplomat said, how long city people will remain quiet is anybody's guess."12-Nov-91,KENYA (97%); UNITED KINGDOM (93%); UNITED STATES (92%); AFRICA (92%); LIBERIA (79%); NIGERIA (79%);,"Allegations by foreign minister Robert Ouko of high-level corruption in the Kenyan government probably were a key factor in his death last year, a retired Scotland Yard investigator testified today. John Troon, head of a special detachment of British detectives recruited by President Daniel arap Moi to pursue the case, charged that he was inhibited from following this line of inquiry by top Kenyan government officials. He said they declined to grant him interviews and abruptly declared his investigation finished. Troon's report was turned over to the Moi government last year but was never made public. Ouko, a widely respected diplomat, was killed in February 1990. His partially burned body was found, with a single bullet wound in the head, not far from his home in western Kenya. Troon's testimony at a judicial inquiry today in the western city of Kisumu comes as the Kenyan government is reeling from recent charges of kickbacks, bribery and theft of government funds under Moi's rule. A recent report of the International Monetary Fund ranks Kenya fourth among all African nations -- behind Liberia, Nigeria and South Africa -- in terms of capital flight. According to official figures, Kenyans hold $ 2.62 billion in overseas accounts. Diplomats here say this sum -- which has grown rapidly over the past decade, sapping funds needed for development -- reflects not only growing investor uncertainty over Kenya's future, but also an exceptional degree of theft and malfeasance in the government. Kenya, long recognized as one of Africa's most stable nations and a comparative haven for foreign investment, is today suffering a serious crisis of confidence, internally and internationally. Denmark, once one of Kenya's biggest donors, recently announced a freeze on all aid, citing corruption. The U.S. government has halved its aid package to $ 26 million this year. Ouko's killing -- and the government's now nearly 300-day-old official inquiry into it -- continues to spur political discontent. It triggered bloody riots among Ouko's Luo tribe in western Kenya, which in turn helped fuel movements pressing for democracy and accountability in Moi's single-party state. Troon, who retired from Scotland Yard last year, said he believes the killing may have been linked to a sharp disagreement between Ouko and another cabinet member during a visit to Washington in February 1990, about a week before the murder. Earlier witnesses have testified that Ouko engaged in a shouting match with former energy minister Nicholas Biwott, the focus of many accusations of official corruption here. During that visit, Moi met with State Department officials to seek ways to increase investment and foreign aid. The officials reportedly told the Kenyans that the quickest way to do this would be to crack down on corruption to create a healthier climate for business here. Last week, several letters from international aid groups charging corruption among Kenyan leaders were read at the hearings. These letters were solicited by Ouko in early 1990 when, according to witnesses, the foreign minister was preparing a report for Moi on corruption. The letters detailed allegations that top Kenyan officials, most notably Biwott, a confidant of Moi, routinely demanded 10 percent kickbacks for most public projects here. The letters portrayed a government that operated on an overriding principle of personal greed, with Biwott accused of holding hundreds of millions of dollars in overseas accounts. The letter writers alleged that growing numbers of foreign investors were refusing to do business here as long as Kenya's top officials remain in power. Biwott has made no response. The disclosure of the documents came on the heals of published accounts about a report prepared by the U.S. Embassy saying the top layer of the Kenyan government is pervaded by a get-rich-quick philosophy."13-Nov-91,KENYA (96%); UNITED KINGDOM (93%); AFRICA (79%); LIBERIA (79%); NIGERIA,"When Kenya's Foreign Minister, Robert Ouko, was found dead 20 months ago, an official inquiry suggested that he had somehow shot and burned himself to death in the bush country. A long-suppressed report by a retired Scotland Yard detective now asserts, far more credibly, that Mr. Ouko was killed because he knew too much about high-level corruption. The report is a timely warning to Western governments too tolerant of Kenya's one-party autocracy. Before his death, the Foreign Minister was compiling testimony alleging that close associates of President Daniel arap Moi routinely sought 10 percent kickbacks on public projects. The figure seems conservative given a report by the International Monetary Fund asserting that overseas accounts held by Kenyans have soared to $2.6 billion, a suspicious capital flight exceeded in Africa only by Liberia, Nigeria and South Africa. Small wonder that Mr. Moi's Government has for six months suppressed the findings on Mr. Ouko's death. Small wonder as well that most Western countries have cut back aid to Kenya, which Mr. Moi has ruled high-handedly since 1978. He has manipulated ethnic rivalries, stifled the press and spurned demands for multiparty elections. Mr. Moi's words are blunt, and zoological. ""I call on all Kenyans to sing like parrots,"" was his counsel a few years ago. Recently he threatened to ""crush"" his political opponents ""like rats."" The report on Mr. Ouko's death may finally nudge indulgent donor states, especially Britain, that have found a redeeming ""stability"" in Mr. Moi's misrule. In present circumstances, lavishing foreign aid on Kenya, to vary Mr. Moi's language, would be like pumping money into a rathole."9-Dec-91,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (95%); UNITED STATES (93%); EUROPE (92%); CENTRAL AFRICA (92%);","The newest Prime Minister of this Central African country said today that the Zairian economy faced imminent bankruptcy and that the situation was not likely to improve until President Mobutu Sese Seko was removed from office. On the eve of a visit to the United States and several European capitals, the Prime Minister, Nguza Karl-i-Bond, who was appointed Prime Minister by General Mobutu two weeks ago, also said he would ask Western donors, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, to virtually take over the management of Zaire's central bank. Given the widespread corruption and mismanagement in the country, he said, leaders, including himself, were incapable of preventing the economy's spinning out of control. ""I'm not a fool, the system is such that I cannot control all these things from this desk,"" Mr. Nguza said during an hourlong interview in his office here. Thus, he said he would call on Western donors to send financial experts to work with Zairians and help bring some order to this impoverished and debt-burdened nation. Steady Loss of Aid The move would be the first in what could be a lengthy diplomatic process that Zairian officials hope will bring this country renewed respectability among international donors. The United States cut off all development aid to Zaire in June because it was more than a year in arrears on debt payments. And last week, Zaire was to have been expelled from the International Monetary Fund because of its failure to pay its debts. Mr. Nguza said, however, that because of his personal intervention, officials of the fund agreed to postpone formal action until at least February, giving the Prime Minister time to draft an economic rehabilitation program. Mr. Nguza also said the wave of street disorders that recently erupted here could easily re-occur. The rioting and looting was led by disgruntled soldiers who had not been paid for several months. Zaire, with more than 38 million people, is facing a ""stomach revolution,"" Mr. Nguza said, adding that unless the country receives an immediate infusion of humanitarian aid, ""the stomach revolution will be fatal to the democratic process."" Hunger and Democracy ""My belief,"" he said, ""is that when people are starving, they are not free. You're free only when you eat, and not in need of vital necessities. And when people are starving, you cannot bring them to understand or follow you when you're talking about democracy."" Mr. Nguza's remarks came before the start today of a long-delayed conference on the nation's political future. Opposition leaders have said they hope to use the forum to either force General Mobutu to resign or strip him of most presidential powers. The Prime Minister is a longtime diplomat and official in Mobutu administrations. Among other things, he has served as Foreign Minister and briefly before as Prime Minister. But under General Mobutu's skillful system of politics -- allowing no one to gain enough standing to be in a position to succeed or oust him -- he has also been condemned to death and, at another point, sentenced to life imprisonment. With this history, he has no reason for gratitude toward the President and identifies himself as an opposition Prime Minister. Even so, the strength of his statement today was surprising. He agreed that it was imperative that General Mobutu be removed from office, but he emphasized that the transition to a multiparty democracy must occur peacefully. By comparison, Mr. Nguza cited recent events in Togo, the West African country where soldiers, seeking to return to power the former military dictator, Gen. Gnassingbe Eyadema, attacked the presidential palace of the reformist civilian Government with tanks and rockets. ""I wouldn't like to have to see tanks here around this office,"" Mr. Nguza remarked, ""and have them say, 'You're not going to leave here unless you resign,' and things like that. It's not that I'm afraid, but if we can do it otherwise, why not?"" Asked if he believed that President Mobutu was genuinely committed to democratic change, he prefaced his remarks by saying: ""I have to be careful as Prime Minister,"" and then he responded, indirectly: ""You have an expression in English, 'You don't teach an old dog new tricks. ' "" When Mr. Nguza served as Prime Minister for eight months in 1980, he decided that he could not govern as long as President Mobutu personally controlled all major institutions. He resigned and fled to Belgium. According to news reports at the time, Mr. Nguza accused Mr. Mobutu of skimming off millions of dollars from the central bank, the nationalized Gecamines Mining Company and the Sozacom Mineral Export Company, undermining a program of economic and financial changes. While in Brussels, Mr. Nguza became the leading figure in a loose-knit coalition of opposition groups, and remained abroad until June 1985, after getting assurances that it would be safe to return. Forms Opposition Then in a move that even some of his longtime supporters still find inexplicable, he accepted an offer by General Mobutu to serve as Zaire's Ambassador to the United States. Since then, he has again broken ranks with the Zairian leader, formed an opposition party, the Federal Union of Independent Republicans, and in recent months become one of the President's harshest critics. His decision to rejoin the Mobutu Government as Prime Minister, however, has rekindled suspicions that he is essentially an opportunist, willing to lean whichever way the political winds seem most favorable. Asked how it felt being called a ""traitor"" by some of his former colleagues in the opposition, Mr. Nguza replied that he had nothing to apologize for, because he remained steadfastly opposed to Mobutu rule."30-Aug-92,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (96%); UNITED STATES (93%); AFRICA (92%); CENTRAL AFRICA (79%); NIGERIA (79%); SUDAN (79%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%); BELGIUM (58%);","A Madison Avenue hair stylist who calls himself Mr. Andrew says that every two weeks for the last eight years he has traveled here to cut the hair of President Mobutu Sese Seko. Taking into account Mr. Andrew's first-class air travel from New York, hotel accommodations at the luxurious Inter-Continental Hotel and whatever fee he earns, each presidential haircut is estimated to cost the citizens of Zaire at least $5,000. A few blocks away from the Inter-Continental, in a fetid, fly-infested ward of the Kinoise Clinic, Mwanda Ngimbi is slowly starving to death. Mr. Mwanda entered the hospital in May after he was robbed and shot by a bandit. He was well enough to leave the hospital in mid-June. But Mr. Mwanda, who earned about $15 a month as a taxi driver, had no money, and hospital officials are holding him under armed guard until he pays his medical bills, which now total about $450 and are mounting daily. Behind the Desperation Since the hospital is not feeding Mr. Mwanda and he has no money to buy food, he depends on the charity of other patients. But that is not nearly enough, and now, suffering from severe malnutrition, he is too weak even to sit up. If Mr. Mwanda is a symbol of Zaire's desperation, Mr. Andrew is a symbol of its cause: the corruption and mismanagement of the Government. While its impressive natural resources sit largely undeveloped, this sprawling Central African country of nearly 40 million people is one of the world's poorest, and getting poorer at a rate that has been gathering ominous speed since September 1991, when a paroxysm of looting and arson wiped out much of its modern industry. ""The vast majority of Zaire is now back to subsistence levels,"" said Herman Cohen, the American Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, who came here early this month on a fact-finding mission. ""And for the first time we're seeing cases of malnutrition."" ""It has always been serious,"" he added, ""but now it's getting dangerous."" So Rich, and Yet So Poor Mbongo Nguodja Harouna, a human rights campaigner whose group, the Voice of the Voiceless, has been trying to win the release of Mr. Mwanda and others in his predicament, said: ""People have never suffered like this before.  A lot of them have simply given up hope."" Called the Belgian Congo until independence in 1960, Zaire is as big as the United States east of the Mississippi. It is sub-Saharan Africa's second most populous nation, after Nigeria. It is one of the world's major producers of copper and cobalt. It has climatic and soil conditions suitable for growing a wide range of tropical crops, including cotton, rubber, coffee, palm oil and sugar. This potential has long been frittered away by corruption, brutality and random violence. But the notion persisted that if only the ""bad Zairians"" who surrounded and ill served Mr. Mobutu were reined, in the country would right itself. Few here dared openly blame the President himself. There was also a widespread belief among Zairians that the country was too valuable to the West for it to let the misery continue and that if only the Western powers would turn their attention to solving the crisis Zaire would become the great power it was destined to be. Those days are over. With the end of the cold war, many here have come to realize that the West, and especially the United States, has no intention of rescuing the Zairians from themselves. Repression Is His Weapon ""We've supported them, yes, and we supported Mobutu,"" said a Western diplomat with long experience in Africa. ""But those days are long over. It's a painful thing for many of them to realize, but Zaire is no longer of great strategic interest."" Even without Western help, Mr. Mobutu hangs on despite a rising public clamor for his removal from the autocratic power he has exercised for 27 years. The President retains his grip through old-fashioned repression. Virtually every night, unmarked vehicles roar through Kinshasa's dusty streets, bearing grim-faced men in khaki uniforms without insignia. A recent report by the Zairian Human Rights League said these men -- known to Kinshasa residents as the ""owls"" -- were members of Mr. Mobutu's Special Presidential Guard, and had made numerous assaults against those perceived as political threats to the Government. ""So many people have been attacked and killed by the owls that we can no longer keep track of them,"" said Mr. Harouna of the Voice of the Voiceless. But Mr. Mobutu's power has been eroded. He spends most of his time aboard his yacht in the Congo River, and has entered Kinshasa, Zaire's capital, only twice this year, both times briefly and without advance notice, under the cover of night and with a squadron of heavily armed guards. People say that if he were to enter Kinshasa openly and move among this city's five million citizens it is doubtful that he would get out alive, given his tenuous control over the country's security forces. New Constitution Planned Bending to public outrage, Mr. Mobutu's representatives have been meeting with opposition leaders since July 1991 in a national political conference intended to draft a new constitution and set a schedule for multiparty elections. This month the delegates began drafting a new constitution enshrining a multiparty system and elected Etienne Tschisekedi, Mr. Mobutu's most prominent opponent, as Prime Minister of a transitional government. Mr. Mobutu has recognized these changes, but balked at the delegates' symbolic move to change the country's name back to the Congo, nullifying a name change made by Mr. Mobutu in 1971 as part of his policy of ridding the country of vestiges of its colonial legacy. Critics have seized on the name Zaire as a symbol of the President's autocratic rule. The political conference has deferred the name change. It also appears to have fallen short of the opposition's main objective, namely to force Mr. Mobutu from office, or at least strip him of most of his presidential powers. ""The one thing that everyone agrees on is that we're a long way from getting rid of Mobutu,"" an opposition leader said. ""He's incredibly tenacious, and appears determined to hold onto power at any cost."" Buana Kabwe, chairman of the Zaire League of Human Rights, said: ""Everything else in the country may be falling apart, but nothing has changed for Mobutu. He still treats the treasury as if it's his private purse. And he couldn't care less about our suffering."" Unpaid Soldiers Mutiny Mr. Mobutu's penchant for conspicuous consumption appears unabated. Among his overseas real-estate holdings, for example, are chateaus in Spain and Belgium, a town house in Paris, a villa near Monte Carlo, an estate in Switzerland, a horse ranch in Portugal and a villa in the Ivory Coast. Last September, Mr. Mobutu's rule seemed about to end. Mutinous soldiers, angered because they had not been paid, began a week of looting and violence. According to a report in July by Africa Watch, a New York-based human rights advocacy group, as the rioting spread throughout the country, it eliminated most of what remained of the modern productive sector, outside of mining. In the Kinshasa area alone, 90,000 jobs were lost, and in the course of the looting at least 240 people were killed. Today, whole sections of the country are under the control of local commanders who routinely ignore orders from Kinshasa. The rioting also led to the evacuation of virtually all expatriate workers -- about 20,000 people, mostly from France, Belgium and the United States. They included most of the country's university professors, teaching hospital staff members, and geologists in the mining industry, as well as a host of Belgian development assistance workers who provided a wide range of services to villages in the interior. Many Seek to Leave The economic collapse since the September riots has been staggering. The annual inflation rate is more than 5,000 percent, largely because the Government abandoned an economic recovery program devised by the International Monetary Fund in early 1990 and increased spending. In January 1990, the national currency traded at about 300 to the dollar; today the rate is about 650,000 to the dollar. The September rioting also prompted many Zairians to join the long lines for visas outside every Western embassy. They include many of this country's best-trained and best-educated citizens. Antoine Beltchira Kalubye, a neurosurgeon at the University of Kinshasa's teaching hospital here, said he knew of at least 100 physicians who had left the country in recent months, most for better paying jobs in South Africa. Senior physicians here make about $75 a month; in South Africa, they can earn about the same amount in a day. Consequently, the quality of medical services has declined, hardly reassuring patients who are already leery of the system after the wide publicity given to cases of patients held hostage for their medical bills. ""It has become very bizarre,"" Dr. Kalubye said. ""Nowadays the last place people want to come if they fall sick is the hospital."" 'A Long Way to Go' George Nzongola, a Zairian and a professor of African studies at Howard University in Washington who recently returned here after living 18 years abroad, said conditions were worse now than they were before independence. ""Under colonialism, the decade of the 50's was a period of prosperity in the Belgian Congo,"" said Mr. Nzongola, who is a delegate at the national conference. ""The colonialists invested in economic and social services. So most people had access to very good schools and ate three meals a day."" ""One person recently told me that we've gone backward 250 years,"" Mr. Nzongola added, ""I hope he's not right."" Asked whether he expected conditions to change, even if Mr. Mobutu were suddenly to disappear from the political scene, Mr. Nzongola shrugged his shoulders. ""We've got a long way to go,"" he said, ""and I hope it's not too late."" Map of Zaire. Chart: ""At a Glance: Zaire"" Zaire (called Congo until 1971) was under Belgian control from 1885 to June 1960. A period of instability followed independence until November 1965, when Mobutu Sese Seko seized power in a bloodless coup. He has ruled as an autocrat ever since. Although Zaire was classified by the World Bank as the world's 12th poorest country in 1990, with a per capita income of $220, it is the world's largest producer of cobalt and the second-largest producer of industrial diamonds. Exports of both commodities are believed to have fallen by as much as 50 percent in the last two years. Zaire's other important mineral product is copper, which accounts for 35 to 55 percent of the country's export earnings. Copper production has fallen by 40 percent since 1986. Inflation has sharply eroded the value of the Zairian currency. In April, all Zairian banks closed because of cash shortages. Except for the police and armed forces, most civil servants have not been paid for several months. Zaire's nearly 40 million people are divided among many tribes, with the largest being the Kongo, Kwango-Kwilu, Mongo, Luba, Bwaka and Zande. The majority speak Bantu languages, though the north is linguistically Sudanese. The lingua franca is French. Zaire is the third largest country in Africa, one-quarter the size of the United States. Its dominant geographic feature is the Congo River. With vast forests and plenty of rainfall, Zaire has huge agricultural, logging and hydroelectic potential."16-May-93,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (96%); UNITED STATES (92%); AFRICA (92%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%); CENTRAL AFRICA (79%); NIGERIA (79%);","In a fly-infested feeding center on the outskirts of Kinshasa, nearly 200 children gathered listlessly around a huge steaming bowl of milky gruel. This was the only meal of the day for some, and others were eating for the first time in days. There was no laughter or play. Some of the children, no more than tiny skeletons with the faces of emaciated old men, were too weak to move. Relief officials predicted that at least 10 percent of the children would soon die of hunger. Until recent months, severe malnutrition and starvation on this scale were virtually unheard of in Kinshasa, the capital of this central African country and a densely packed river port city of nearly five million people. Unparalleled Since the 1960's ""We haven't seen this amount of hunger in West Africa since the Biafran war in Nigeria during the 1960's,"" said Wayne King, the chief officer for the United States Agency for International Development here, who has worked in Africa for 20 years. A State Department cable in March, in what it called a conservative estimate, said at least 5.2 percent of Zairians, or nearly 1.8 million people, were suffering from ""acute malnutrition."" The cable recommended that the United States provide emergency short-term food assistance, warning that a delay could make any aid ""too little too late."" In truth, the acute food problems facing Zaire appear self-inflicted, the result of nearly 30 years of Government corruption and economic ineptitude. Now they have become so severe that they are bending society with their pressure. ""It's always been a struggle to live here, but things have never been this bad,"" said Zanga Yumbi, a local Red Cross official. In many families, she said, food is so scarce that girls are fed one day and boys the next. Some children have been abandoned to die, an extremely rare practice in a society where the extended family system, an informal network of blood ties, often embraces hundreds of people. There were always aunts, uncles or cousins willing to provide housing and food for children whose parents, for whatever reason, could no longer take care of them. But for the first time, diplomats, relief officials and missionaries said, the level of deprivation is so severe and pervasive that even close relatives are reluctant to take in ailing or needy children, and a growing number of parents have been forced to seek help beyond the traditional family connections. Parents Give Up Hope Musongi-Mpwono Munol, the director of the Kizito-Kingabwa Health Center, said nearly 60 percent of the children there had been abandoned -- left to the care of relief organizations and missionaries -- because their parents could no longer afford to feed them. ""Many people simply don't have the ability to support all their children anymore, so they are making very difficult choices,"" said Sister Tacita Laranang, a Roman Catholic nun who works at St. Kizito's feeding center. St. Kizito is one of nearly 30 centers that Doctors Without Borders, a European relief organization, has opened in the last year. Relief organizations that have stepped in receive virtually no assistance from Zaire's troubled Government. And it is not only the children who are suffering. Mrs. Yumbi of the Red Cross said that early in May, an old and sickly woman dressed in rags had been abandoned at the doorstep of a local church. ""This would have never happened even five years ago,"" Mrs. Yumbi said. Kinshasa's deprivation is a poverty that somehow seems a terrible mistake. The food shortages stem not from drought, which devastated food production in Ethiopia in the mid-1980's and more recently in Zimbabwe, Mozambique and other countries in southern Africa for much of the last two years. Nor do the shortages result from violent ethnic and territorial disputes, as in Somalia or the Sudan. Food and Resources Plentiful Indeed, food is relatively plentiful in Kinshasa's central market, and north of Kinshasa stretches an area with more than enough arable land to feed the country's 40 million people. Moreover, Zaire is a leading copper and cobalt producer, the world's largest supplier of industrial diamonds, rich in coffee, timber, palm oil and other agricultural exports, and it also has vast reserves of hydroelectric power. At the top of this country blessed with abundant natural resources and cursed by starvation is one of the world's richest men. Mobutu Sese Seko, the country's autocratic leader for 28 years, has a personal fortune estimated at $4 billion, say African and Western diplomats as well as numerous scholars on Zaire. ""In our view, Zaire is not faced with a food shortage per se, but rather an acute food access problem,"" concluded a recent study by Catholic Relief Services, a group based in the United States. To be sure, chronic malnutrition has long existed in Kinshasa, but the problem has steadily worsened in recent years. The problem became a crisis with rioting in September 1991, when disgruntled soldiers seeking back pay went on a rampage, looting homes and shops and setting off a wave of violence that left dozens dead. Belgium, the former colonial ruler of Zaire, and France deployed troops to help evacuate 30,000 foreigners, mostly Europeans, and to maintain order. Rioting by Soldiers Repeated Rioting erupted again in February when soldiers discovered that the new five-million-zaire bank notes used to pay them were impossible to spend. Heavily armed soldiers seized control of the Parliament building and held several hundred lawmakers hostage, demanding that they order local merchants to accept the new bank notes. Hundreds, including the French Ambassador, were killed. Since then, the economic collapse has been staggering. Many of the foreigners held vital technical and managerial positions -- jobs that most African and Western diplomats believe that Zairians, for now, are incapable of filling. More broadly, Zairian businesses dependent on imported materials, spare parts or machines have faced sharp reductions in production and earnings and laid off tens of thousands of workers. As a result, according to figures provided by the United States Embassy here, before the 1991 riots, unemployment stood at nearly 40 percent, a figure almost unheard of even among Africa's poorest cities. The unemployment rate has continued to rise and is now estimated at 80 percent. Zaire's continuing power struggle between Mr. Mobutu and leaders of the opposition has virtually paralyzed most governmental institutions. Compounding the misery, the annual inflation rate is now about 4,400 percent, partly because of a huge budget deficit that developed after the Government abandoned a broad range of belt-tightening measures devised by the International Monetary Fund in early 1990, and instead increased spending. Since then, Zaire has been declared ""non-cooperating"" by the monetary fund, and a decision to expel it from the world's leading governmental lending organization is believed to be imminent. Migration to City Slows An enigma that strikes many Western analysts visiting or living in Zaire is why the people appear to tolerate conditions that clearly should produce deep discontent. Despite the economic deprivation of recent years -- hyperinflation and the lack of jobs and housing -- there has been a steady migration of people into the city. But even that may be changing, said Martine Dedeur Warder, a nutritionist with Doctors Without Borders. For one thing, prices for basic food items have become so high here that even the relatively well-to-do are struggling. Mid-level civil service workers, for example, earn about $25 a month, yet a 110-pound sack of corn flour -- enough to feed a family of four for about a week -- costs about $50. To make matters worse, she said, most Government employees have not been paid for at least four months. As a result, Miss Dedeur Warder said, for the first time in recent memory, migration from the villages to the city appears to be slowing, and perhaps even reversing. ""People are leaving the city and returning to the bush because they understand there's no food, there are no jobs and there's no money here,"" she said. ""Leaving Kinshasa is a drastic step for many Zairians, but it's one of the few solutions for stopping the misery here."" Map of Zaire, indicating Kinshasa"17-Jun-93,NIGERIA (97%); AFRICA (93%); UNITED STATES (79%);,"Nigeria's planned return to civilian rule was suspended today when a commission appointed by the military leaders set aside the results of Saturday's presidential elections. There had been growing indications that the candidate of the Social Democratic Party, Moshood Abiola, was well on his way to a resounding triumph over his rival, Bashir Tofa, of the National Republican Convention. Both had campaigned against military rule. The vote had been heralded by many Nigerians as a historic end to nearly a decade of military rule in Africa's most populous nation. Hope Tainted by Skepticism The election was to be only the third time since independence from Britain in 1960 that a president would rise to office through the ballot box and not through military action. But even before today's announcement, there had been considerable skepticism over whether the military leader, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, was committed to democratic rule. [This skepticism was reflected in Washington. Though the State Department had no official comment on the election, some Administration officials said they were not surprised that problems had arisen. [While they said they had no reason to believe that General Baba ngida was directly involved in the delay of the return to democracy, ""there is a lot of cynicism about the process that has grown up,"" one official said, ""sort of a dark apprehension that it would never happen.""] 'A Hidden Agenda' Beko Ransome-Kuti, chairman of the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, said today that he had long suspected General Babangida was stalling the shift to civilian rule. ""He's always had a hidden agenda,"" to remain in power, Dr. Ransome-Kuti said. General Babangida has postponed a return to civilian rule three times since 1990, and the military authorities have annulled a number of gubernatorial and parliamentary elections, saying they had been compromised by financial improprieties and vote-buying. Since independence, there have been seven successful coups and three of the nation's eight leaders have been assassinated. Two brief periods of civilian rule collapsed after allegations by the military of incompetence and wholesale corruption. A General's Promise Still, General Babangida has said repeatedly in recent speeches and interviews that come what may, the military will return to its barracks on Aug. 27, the eighth anniversary of the coup that brought him to power. Nigeria, with about 90 million people and more than 250 tribal groups, has always been difficult to govern. From 1967 to 1970, the nation was mired in a war to quell secessionists among the mostly Ibo peoples in the Eastern Region known as Biafra. Despite its great natural resources -- Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer -- the country remains basically poor; per-capita income in 1991 was $250. The suspension of the election results came in response to a suit filed by the Association for a Better Nigeria, a lobbying group of wealthy business executives, politicians and military officers who have led a highly visible campaign urging General Babangida to remain in office at least four more years. The association asserted that the transition to civilian rule had been compromised by widespread vote-tampering and corruption, and on Tuesday the group won a court order instructing the national electoral commission not to release election results. Justice Mohamveg Saleh, the chief judge of the high court in Abuja, the capital, ordered the commission not to publish the results until legal arguments over vote-rigging were heard by the court. This process could take months, effectively nullifying the election and keeping the military in power. This morning Humphrey Nwosu, the chairman of the commission, reportedly met with his staff and officials from the President's office to decide how to respond. Late this afternoon Mr. Nwosu issued a statement saying, in effect, that the Government had no choice but to suspend the elections or face being held in contempt of court. Mr. Nwosu added that he would appeal the court's jurisdiction over the electoral process. Details of Charges The association's suit charged, among other things, that officials of the Social Democratic Party had bribed delegates to the party's nominating convention to vote for Mr. Abiola. It also said that the campaigns of both presidential candidates had increased tension among Nigeria's many ethnic and religious groups, and that if an election were to occur now, it would was likely to ""lead to chaos and a breach of public peace."" It was difficult to assess the accusations. Many neutral Nigerian analysts said they were not persuaded that these assertions constituted proof of systematic fraud or posed a threat to security. Foreign observers have generally described the elections as free and fair. Even though the decision to set aside the election results stunned many, the reaction among people milling in Lagos's crowded streets and in bars and restaurants tonight was subdued. Salle Lamido, of the Social Democratic Party, said on state television tonight, ""The court order is very, very contradictory and that shows the futility of the entire thing. The court has not been fair. I believe at the end of the day justice will prevail."" A chart yesterday showing the distribution of ethnic groups in Nigeria misstated the percentage for those who are members of other than the Hausa, Yoruba, Ibo or Fulani. They are 33 percent of the population.

(pg. A12) Map of Nigeria showing locaiton of Abuja. (pg. A12)"20-Nov-93,NIGERIA (99%);,"With the generals once again in open and absolute command, Nigeria is facing the prospect of economic chaos, political upheaval and perhaps even conflict between its two major tribes, the politically dominant Hausa in the north and the restive Yoruba in the southwest, Nigerians, diplomats and foreign experts say. Some of the experts say the crisis is more dire than any since 1967, when the eastern region called Biafra tried to split away, plunging the country into three years of civil war that cost up to a million lives. The current crisis began when the military Government, which planned for six years to return to civilian rule, abruptly reneged on the promise after presidential elections in June. Amid street protests, the military leader, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, handed power over to a transitional Government nominally headed by a civilian, Ernest Shonekan. Now that Government has been shoved aside by another military strongman, Gen. Sani Abacha. On Wednesday, General Abacha was installed as Nigeria's seventh military leader since independence from Britain in 1960. He promptly began dismantling the democratic institutions that had been carefully constructed, abolishing national and state assemblies, dissolving the two military-created political parties, removing elected state governors and proscribing all political meetings and associations. General Suspected of Corruption ""We did not expect destruction of this magnitude of the democratic structures,"" Albert Legogie, deputy president of the now-defunct Senate, told The Associated Press. Like many of Nigeria's military rulers, General Abacha is widely thought by diplomats, experts and other Nigerians to be corrupt, with a substantial income from the country's rich oil industry, from construction projects in the new capital, Abuja, and various other Government contracts and building permits. Leaders of Nigerian civil rights and pro-democracy groups assailed General Abacha's seizure of power. A statement from the Civil Liberties Organization called on Nigerians to reject ""a power-corrupted military bent on turning free citizens to slaves in their own country."" But on Thursday, in a brisk 10-minute address to the nation, General Abacha warned that he was not a man to brook disorder. ""Any attempt to test our will will be decisively dealt with,"" he vowed. But he gave little idea of what he had in mind for an anxious country. He talked vaguely about setting up a constitutional conference to chart Nigeria's future but, in what many read as an ominous sign, he did not set any date for handing power back to civilians. As Defense Minister and before that as army Chief of Staff, General Abacha was a major player in Nigeria's corrupt and politicized military. He helped to engineer the coup that overthrew the last civilian Government in December 1983, and another one that brought General Babangida to power in 1985. Ever since General Babangida stepped aside in August and installed an interim Government under Mr. Shonekan, the 50-year-old General Abacha has been the true power behind the scenes. Some diplomats believe that the two generals had a falling out, and they point out that one of General Abacha's first moves during the brief stewardship of Mr. Shonekan was to remove key military commanders put in place by General Babangida. Tribal and Regional Rivalries Some pronounced General Babangida discredited and finished. But others said that reports of the rift are greatly exaggerated, and they did not rule out an attempt by General Babangida to stage a political comeback at some point. ""It could be that Babangida is playing a long game in which he will emerge as a presidential candidate in an election organized by Abacha,"" said one expert interviewed here. Both generals are Muslims from the Hausa-speaking north, which has traditionally produced top officers and has dominated politics in the country of 90 million people. By contrast, Moshood Abiola, the man who is generally thought to have won the June elections, is a Yoruba from the south, though he, too, is a Muslim. The interim leader, Mr. Shonekan, who never achieved a popular base of support, was likewise a Yoruba. The Yoruba, concentrated around the economic and political center, Lagos, are beginning to ""chafe under the northern yoke,"" as one Nigerian politician put it when interviewed by telephone from Lagos. Referring to the center of Yoruba culture, he said, ""People in Abeokuta are wondering why northerners always outmaneuver southerners."" The third major section of the country, which produces the oil that brings in 95 percent of export earnings, is the east, where the Ibo predominate. They have not assumed a major role in national life since losing the civil war. Demonstrations in Southwest Most of the strikes and protests against the annulment of the elections occurred in the southwest. The protests were given a lift last week when a court in Lagos ruled that General Babangida had no power to install an interim Government and that the Government was thus illegal. Today, clashes between the police and pro-democracy demonstrators were reported in three southwestern cities, Abeokuta, Akure and Ilorin. Lagos was quiet. Banks, major shops and factories remained closed, as they have been since last week. Those demonstrations were caused by the announcement of a sixfold increase in the price of fuel. The increase was part of a spate of economic reforms undertaken by Mr. Shonekan under the prodding of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Until the increase, Government fuel subsidies drove the retail price down to about 12 cents a gallon. Because of price differences with surrounding countries, where it sold between $4 and $5 a gallon, smuggling was rife. Much of it involved the military. Despite its oil exports, which produced $11.7 billion in 1992, Nigeria's economy is in trouble. The country's foreign debts amount to about $30 billion, and arrears on its debts total about $5 billion. If General Abacha rolls back the fuel increase in a bid for instant popularity, he would be undercutting the austerity program on which hopes for an economic recovery are pinned."22-Jan-94,FRANCE (97%); AFRICA (97%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%); CENTRAL AFRICA (92%);,"After decades of fraternal gestures that could barely disguise graft and back-room politics, France's special relations with its former African colonies are undergoing extensive change that could alter the power balance on the continent. The vast swath of territory across West and Central Africa controlled by often ruthless rulers who looked to Paris for funds, instructions and ultimate military salvation no longer serves as a point of conflict among foreign powers, robbing French influence of much of its significance. A new generation of Africans is emerging that no longer seems bound by the old colonial instincts. Outraged by the corrupt regimes and declining living standards that have proved endemic under French tutelage, they are looking elsewhere, especially to the United States, for help and inspiration. In France, young technocrats with enhanced influence under the conservative government of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur are insisting that Paris no longer can afford the moral and financial luxury of propping up autocrats willing to do France's bidding as long as they can loot the treasuries. ""The old days when we could handle problems among a few of us are coming to an end,"" said Fernand Wibaux, a close associate of Jacques Foccart, known as ""Monsieur Afrique,"" who served as the political and intelligence overlord for the continent under President Charles de Gaulle. ""We led these African states to independence in 1960, and then we managed to prevent the 'Balkanization' that everybody warned about through the franc zone,"" Wibaux said, referring to the fixed exchange rates for France's former African colonies set up in 1946 to guarantee economic ties with France. ""But now they [current policy-makers] are taking the attitude that you must shoot a dog if you think it has rabies."" But behind the guise of paternalistic care lies an ugly image that France has treated black Africa like a cash cow, exploiting its resources and markets, protecting dictators and even using those countries as conduits to channel funds to French political parties. Ten days ago, 13 African countries in the African Financial Community's franc zone announced they would slash the value of their currencies in half, pegging their money at 100 instead of 50 to the French franc, while a 14th country, Comoros, devalued its currency by 25 percent. The action was designed to increase domestic production and investment over time by generating a boost in exports. It was the first time the parity of the franc zone was altered, and the magnitude of the devaluation demonstrated how out of whack the economic relationship between France and its colonies had become. The devaluation already has spurred panic buying that some experts predict will trigger shortages and possibly food riots in places like Niger and the Central African Republic. But some exporters, such as Ivory Coast, the Congo, Gabon and Cameroon, which have resources such as coffee, cocoa, cotton and oil, could find that their sales abroad will increase. The financial shock became inevitable last September, when Balladur informed the African leaders in a letter that France was no longer prepared to serve as lender of last resort. In the future, Balladur said, France would determine its aid policy by doling out money only to those countries that subscribed to terms set by the International Monetary Fund. In doing so, Balladur disregarded advice from France's ""old colonialists"" who claimed he would end up ceding French influence in the region to the IMF and its ultimate paymaster, the United States. French industry was also troubled by the change, because it would mean that it would no longer enjoy the privileged access and lopsided profits gained through such captive markets. But the franc zone has steadily impoverished the Africans by impeding their ability to export and encouraging them to buy from abroad at the artificially high rate. Meanwhile, corrupt leaders found the system convenient because it allowed them to easily funnel money to secret Swiss bank accounts. The franc zone also helped funnel development aid and kickbacks from industrial contracts back into France to finance political parties, according to diplomats and French officials familiar with the arrangements. Much of the $ 700 million in annual development aid to the former colonies never actually leaves French hands, because a project may be carried out by a French company that in turn may provide a financial kickback to the requisite political channel. In addition, contributions from industrial firms that win major contracts in the former African colonies often are channeled back to politicians who help clinch the deal through local regional councils, according to French and African experts. In the end, French taxpayers ultimately pay for what are subsidies channeled to the political parties. During the 1980s, President Francois Mitterrand and successive Socialist governments encountered fierce criticism when they intervened to save autocrats such as Gabon's Omar Bongo or Benin's Mathieu Kerekou. But at a 1990 French-African summit meeting in La Baule, only months after the Berlin Wall had fallen, Mitterrand signaled that France would link its cooperation in Africa to those rulers ""who make efforts along the path toward greater liberty."" The initiative led to 23 elections in the past three years, but has not caused too much grumbling among the autocrats. In a disputed election held in December in Gabon, Bongo was praised by France for getting ""elected"" to his fifth seven-year term in spite of his record."6-Aug-94,AFRICA (98%); COTE D'IVOIRE (95%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (94%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%); HOLY SEE (90%); FRANCE (90%);,"Felix Houphouet-Boigny, the longtime president of this West African nation, died at 88 last December. In this jungle-enclosed city, his birthplace, stand the monuments to his grandiose ambitions -- for himself and for Africa's economic future. Few sub-Saharan African countries achieved anything like the economic success Ivory Coast enjoyed during the 1960s and 1970s under Houphouet-Boigny's firm hand. Lifted by French investment and rising production of cash crops, Ivorian personal incomes soared as the economy hit double-digit rates of expansion in some years. Steel and glass skyscrapers went up in the coastal city of Abidjan as it blossomed into a seaside playground for European expatriates. In Yamoussoukro, the newly declared, underpopulated inland capital, no expense was spared on avenues wide enough for jumbo jets, thousands of streetlights, three universities, half a dozen hotels, an airport, car dealerships, a radio and microwave transmission tower, landscaped gardens, playing fields, artificial lakes, the world's largest Catholic basilica (a replica -- but on a far grander scale -- of St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City) and a presidential family palace guarded by crocodiles and stone walls more than a mile around. Yamoussoukro was ""the ultra-modern prefiguration of the Africa of tomorrow,"" exhorted a hotel brochure from the early 1980s. But now the promised future has arrived, and it is none too exhilarating. Since 1980, personal incomes in Ivory Coast have shrunk by a staggering 50 percent. Debt has soared to about $ 18 billion, leaving the country with one of the highest rates of debt per capita in the world. The economy has been contracting steadily since 1987, dragging Ivory Coast from its earlier middle income status toward the ranks of the world's poorest economies. And Yamoussoukro's extravagance, far from the crowning symbol of Houphouet-Boigny's Ivorian miracle, today looks to have been ""a terrible economic step,"" said Joseph Yao, director of the Ivorian Center for Economic and Social Research. ""One of the basics of economics is that you create before you distribute,"" he added. ""In Africa, we started distributing and figured we would create later."" Across sub-Saharan Africa, more than two dozen countries and tens of millions of impoverished people are paying the price for years of misdirected investment, unbalanced development, squandered savings, government mismanagement and corruption, ineffective foreign aid programs, falling commodity prices and the brutal imperatives of a global economy that is leaving Africa behind while it races toward the next century. On average, the region's economy shrunk 1.2 percent each year between 1980 and 1991, according to the World Bank. It has recovered slightly since then, according to the African Development Bank, but not enough to keep pace with swelling populations. The bank's forecast for 1994 is more of the same, at best. As a consequence, rising numbers of Africans are sliding into poverty as each year passes. To many African economists, politicians and businessmen, the decline is especially galling because it has occurred while other areas of the developing world -- southeast Asia, China, India and much of Latin America -- have expanded economically, in some cases by leaps and bounds. Consider Nigeria and Indonesia, for instance -- both oil-rich and heavily populated at independence. In 1973, when world oil prices first boomed, their per capita economies were the same size -- which is to say, very small. By 1990, average incomes in Indonesia had doubled, but in Nigeria they had fallen, despite billions of dollars in windfall revenues. Ghana and South Korea had the same per capita incomes just 35 years ago. Today the average South Korean is richer than the average Portuguese, but the average Ghanaian is poorer than he or she was 20 years ago. To an overwhelming majority of Western economists at lending institutions such as the World Bank, and to increasing numbers of their African counterparts, the cause of this disparity -- and of Ivory Coast's failed miracle -- is no great mystery. It boils down, they say, to disastrous economic policies. In a detailed survey of the sub-Saharan African economy published by the World Bank in February, the bank's economists rated the economic policies of 26 regional governments on a scale from ""good"" to ""very poor."" Not a single African government was rated good, and only one, Ghana, was judged adequate. Nearly half were rated poor or very poor, including Ivory Coast, which ranked near the bottom. Most African governments intervene heavily and inefficiently in nearly every economic sector. Hundreds of uncompetitive state-owned monopolies smother business competition. High taxes and tariffs throttle international trade and foreign investment. Unsustainable price subsidies and welfare benefits for city dwellers lead to heavy government borrowing and, in some cases, high rates of inflation. Artificially high exchange rates for many African currencies, which make it easier for urban African elites to buy cheap luxury imports, smother exports and punish farmers in the countryside, where most of Africa's poorest live. Corruption and theft by African government leaders and their allies sap national savings that might otherwise be reinvested in productive businesses. ""This is my country too, so I have the right to work without giving someone money underneath the table,"" complained Bergson Koffi, a U.S.-trained Ivorian businessman who said he has spent about $ 1 million since 1986 trying unsuccessfully to get licenses for a new cellular phone company. Koffi alleged that government employees involved in potentially competitive deals block his progress. ""They're trying to make me waste time so I will give up,"" he said. Many businessmen do just that. As the pressures of failed economic policies have caused African economies to shrink, political instability and ethnic conflict have risen, frightening off foreign investors and crippling local businesses. Japanese car and truck makers, for example, keep their inventories floating on container ships off the East African coast, only docking when they have an order, because they judge it too risky and inefficient to keep their vehicles in showrooms, according to the Harvard Business School. One worsening problem is a relative lack of skilled managers. Unlike in other regions of the Third World, African governments did not use heavy control over their economies after independence to force rapid industrialization, with its side benefits of new technologies and trained work forces. Instead, they relied on agricultural and mineral exports, which among other things provided easy money for crooked governments. Today, nine out of 10 dollars earned from African exports come from raw materials and agricultural crops, by far the highest percentage worldwide. As in Ivory Coast, such African resource exports typically pass through inefficient government-controlled marketing boards that are widely described as money machines for government ministers and their political allies. Farmers themselves are heavily taxed, directly and indirectly. ""It was a clear political choice that the government will control all the money coming into the country"" from cocoa and coffee exports, said Ivorian businessman Mahamadou Sylla. ""The whole system was based on that. ... The president and the government wanted this power."" Yet the total pool of money available has steadily declined. That is partly because Africa's dependence on commodity exports is at odds with a basic global economic trend toward increased manufacturing. As more countries shovel resources into the global trading economy, and as more wealth around the world is created by adding value with manufacturing and new technologies, the relative importance -- and relative price -- of many African resources has declined. Small and fragile to begin with, sub-Saharan Africa's industrial sector has shrunk even faster during the last decade than its overall economy, according to the Overseas Development Institute. New foreign investment in African industry, although growing, is a tiny fraction of such investment worldwide. Western banks, governments and multilateral agencies sometimes reinforce failure in Africa with poorly designed or self-interested loan and aid programs, according to some critics, both Western and African. In West Africa, for example, France spends what diplomats estimate as $ 2 billion to $ 5 billion annually to subsidize former colonies that today pursue what many Western economists see as highly inefficient economic policies. The World Bank, under what bankers and diplomats describe as heavy French pressure, has kicked in large sums to support these West African governments, including Ivory Coast. Some Western-funded economic policies that many economists see as inefficient for Africans have nonetheless benefited Western business and political interests, said economists, diplomats and businessmen. Japanese and European aid programs to Africa heavily emphasize credits tied to the purchase of machinery from the donor's own corporations. Businessmen in Tokyo and London come up with ideas about how African countries can use their products, then try to sell these aid ideas to their governments. ""If you look at the amount of money the [World] Bank and the French government poured into the economy to support these weaknesses, it's really quite scandalous,"" said development economist Roger Riddell. World Bank officials say that while some of their past policies may be debatable, the bulk of responsibility for failure lies with recipient African governments. And lately, World Bank economists argue, there are signs of new commitment to economic reform in many sub-Saharan African countries. Indeed, while the region's overall economic picture is gloomy, there are pockets of exception where governments have aggressively pursued free-market-oriented reform programs and have been rewarded with persistent economic growth. In Ghana, where President Jerry Rawlings has stuck with painful reforms for a decade, the economy has grown by an average 5 to 6 percent each year since 1983. The World Bank, which desperately needs an African success story to serve as a model for its economic prescriptions, hails Ghana as a regional leader. As with Ivory Coast earlier, however, the question is whether Ghana's achievements will last. A decade of robust growth has pulled Ghana from the deep economic pit into which it had fallen by the early 1980s. Investment has been redirected to rural areas. New businesses are opening, the infrastructure is improving, and some foreign and expatriate Ghanaian investors are starting to speak confidently of the future. Yet some economists argue that with a swelling population, even Ghana's respectable growth rates are not good enough. Technology-driven industrial investment has been slow to materialize. Although the government has not squandered revenue on grandiose white elephants such as Ivory Coast's Yamoussoukro, Ghana has been hesitant to privatize state businesses or to loosen its grip on commodity marketing boards. Why don't more African governments adopt free-market-oriented programs similar to Ghana's? One key reason, Africans and outside analysts say, is political. The failed economic policies pursued by many African leaders for the last three decades have not been entirely irrational: They were often constructed to enrich undemocratic leaders and to appease the urban populations that pose the greatest political threat to these leaders. Government control of the economy, overvalued exchange rates, lavish subsidies and other similar policies allow otherwise weak or illegitimate African politicians to buy off opponents and build empires of patronage, especially in urban areas that are key to political control. Free market reform as prescribed by the World Bank often means pulling the plug on these political lifelines, most dramatically in the cities. Urban revolt in the aftermath of economic liberalization ""is a frightening prospect,"" said D.F. Annan, speaker of Ghana's parliament. In Ghana, the revolt never came. But in other African countries, ""IMF riots,"" as they are called, have become a regular -- and to African political leaders, often terrifying -- consequence of attempted economic change. Yet in this African trap of immovable leaders and irresistible economic decline, a new generation of Africans increasingly insists that something has to give. In politics, these younger Africans are the driving force of the continent's nascent democracy movement. In economics, despite the high government-imposed barriers, they represent a new wave of entrepreneurial, sometimes Western-trained managers who want Africa to succeed as Asia and much of Latin America already have done. Many of these younger, business-minded Africans are visible in relatively prosperous, dynamic cities such as Accra and Abidjan. Among them is Luc Tanoh, a young Ivorian computer engineer and businessman who is struggling to succeed amid Ivory Coast's economic rubble. ""With a new generation coming, a new civilization is emerging. Young Africans born after independence, trained in their country ... are really the resources lacking in the past. ""If today Africa is not able to seize this opportunity, the young human resources, then we will really be in trouble.""

Apartheid was vanquished. The struggle against colonialism ended in victory when Djibouti won independence from France in 1977 and British-controlled Rhodesia became independent Zimbabwe in 1980. The end of the Cold War also put an end to the proxy conflicts between Moscow and Washington that ravaged the continent from Angola to Somalia. Angola's war continues, but it is no longer a contest between Moscow and Washington. These historic developments ought to have been unrelieved good news for sub-Saharan Africa. But in many countries, what loomed as an era of promise dissolved into one of drift and disorder as Africa was increasingly left to its own devices. Except for televised disasters, and triumphs like Mandela's inauguration, Africa largely disappeared from the agenda of the major powers after the conflicts that interested them came to an end. With its limited economic clout and endemic corruption, and without the moral imperative of the movement against South Africa's apartheid system of racial separation, Africa no longer commands the same level of international concern as it did when rivals elsewhere needed African votes in the United Nations. Now mostly on its own, Africa has entered another period of struggle, perhaps more brutal than the first three: order against chaos. In the gloomiest forecasts, the disintegrations of Somalia, Rwanda, Liberia and Sudan project Africa's future, with the centrifugal forces in many countries compounded by international indifference. ""Africa is left adrift at a time of economic crisis, perpetuating its sense of marginalization, frustration and anger over its seeming abandonment,"" scholars John W. Harbeson and Donald Rothchild wrote in ""Africa in World Politics."" ""The picture that emerged at the end of the 1980s was one of increasing African peripheralization,"" they wrote. ""The explanation for this phenomenon varied, but it included the end of the Cold War, the industrialized countries' disillusionment with the economic and political performance of the African states, and the growing preoccupation of the developed countries with their own economic problems."" The CIA demonstrated this point in June when it floated a plan to close 15 stations in Africa to save money. Africa was targeted because the agency was never really interested in it anyway, a senior CIA official said. ""We have never been in Africa to report on Africa,"" he said. ""We went into Africa as part of the covert activity of the Cold War,"" because it was easier to recruit Cuban and East European agents there than in their home countries. The British international relief agency Oxfam, in a report last year, complained that the industrialized nations, ""preoccupied with more 'strategic' concerns elsewhere ... have allowed Africa, the world's most impoverished region, to become increasingly marginalized. ""Financial resource flows are stagnating in real terms, debt-relief measures have been inadequate, and there has been no attempt to improve the region's external trade environment,"" Oxfam said. ""To make matters worse, the international donor community and multilateral agencies -- the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund -- continue to insist on economic policy reforms which have manifestly failed to generate recovery, while imposing huge social costs."" In a speech last May, James Gustave Speth, director of the United Nations Development Program, argued that it was in developed nations' self-interest to help Africa. If they do not, he said, disease, poverty and environmental degradation in Africa will ensure that ""our own shores"" will be affected by ""illegal aliens, refugees, drugs, crime"" and other problems from Africa. But he also noted that most nations' attention is focused elsewhere. Russia, once a looming military presence in the Horn of Africa and patron of leftist regimes from Ethiopia to Mozambique, has all but withdrawn from the continent. The United States, which was heavily engaged in Africa as a counterweight to the Soviets, has ""no strategic interests in Africa,"" according to Pentagon doctrine. Among the industrialized nations, the United States ranks last in percentage of gross national product devoted to African aid. Except for diplomatic involvement, Britain, Belgium and Portugal mostly disappeared from Africa when they surrendered their colonies there. Japanese investment is minimal. Among the major powers, only France remains actively committed in Africa, with troops in seven countries, extensive economic and political ties and effective control of the currency of its former colonies in West Africa. ""We have intervened in Africa whenever an unacceptable situation had to be remedied,"" former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing once said -- a comment that applied perfectly to the recent, two-month French military intervention in Rwanda. So thin is U.S. political and economic interest in Africa that one of the panels at a recent White House conference on Africa was devoted to the subject of ""constituency building"" -- how to get more people to care. Donald McHenry, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the United States has ""a general responsibility [for Africa] in the interests of mankind, and given the melting pot nature of our society it carries something of a special interest as the origin of 10 or 12 percent of our population."" But McHenry suggested that direct U.S. interest in Africa is limited to heading off disasters such as the Rwandan refugee crisis, because ""when disaster occurs, man-made or nature, we are going to end up paying for some of it."" U.S. policy makers and some independent analysts say South Africa is capable of vigorous economic growth that will also contribute to the development of its neighbors. But ""whereas South Africa and the southern African region increasingly command our attention for both economic and political reasons, much of the rest of the continent is becoming more marginal in terms of U.S. national interest priorities,"" said Walter H. Kansteiner, White House Africa policy director in the Bush administration. Western thinking about sub-Saharan Africa appears generally divided along the lines of optimism vs. pessimism. The optimists see a new generation of realistic African leaders adopting economic and political reforms that could lead to peace and prosperity. They also see indigenous peace and human rights movements increasingly asserting themselves and putting pressure on leaders to abandon repressive policies. The pessimists see an accelerating slide into the chaos and anarchy tearing apart Somalia, Rwanda, Sudan, Liberia and Angola. In both views, what happens to Africa in the coming decade is largely up to the Africans, not to the foreign powers that for decades manipulated Africa for their own ends. The most pessimistic prospect was offered by Robert D. Kaplan in an apocalyptic article in the February issue of Atlantic Monthly, ""The Coming Anarchy."" According to Kaplan, overpopulation, crime, corruption and the ready availability of weapons will doom virtually all of West Africa to lapse into malarial anarchy. He predicted a breakdown of civilization as ""foreign embassies are shut down, states collapse, and contact with the outside world takes place through dangerous, disease-ridden coastal trading posts."" Envisioning a lawless era in which the writ of government will not extend to the African interior, Kaplan said Africa ""faces cataclysms that could make the Ethiopian and Somalian famines pale in comparison."" President Clinton and each of his senior foreign policy advisers have read Kaplan's article, a White House official said recently. According to White House National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, an Africa specialist, the challenge facing the outside world is figuring out how to help Africa avoid the nightmare predicted by Kaplan and achieve instead ""a culture of tolerance, a flowering of civil society and the protection of human dignity throughout the continent."" But the tools available to achieve that lofty goal do not include an increase in direct U.S. aid, which is holding steady at about $ 800 million a year, much of it directed at South Africa. Instead, U.S. policy envisions a new political and economic climate in Africa that will encourage indigenous development and foreign investment. Some analysts dismiss that as pie in the sky. But others -- including the U.N. Development Program's Speth and Michael Clough, Africa policy specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations -- argue that U.S. and other foreign aid in the past has done more harm than good as Africans squandered it on extravagant projects and arms purchases. Clough, who was Africa issues director for the Clinton transition team, wrote in his book ""Free at Last?"" that the bulk of U.S. assistance to Africa during the Cold War went to six countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, Liberia, Somalia, Sudan and Zaire. ""By any standard, this is not a list of African success stories,"" he wrote. Clough said in an interview that the argument over aid funding levels is ""absurd"" because amounts available will never be enough to make a significant difference. That being the case, he said the Clinton administration's evolving long-term approach, stressing human rights and free markets to stimulate economic growth and thus head off disasters such as the one in Somalia, ""makes sense in Africa."" But he questioned whether it can succeed, because ""there is very little political payoff"" in Africa and ""nobody except Lake cares about Africa anyway."" Optimists about Africa said in interviews that it is necessary to distinguish between failed states such as Somalia and old-fashioned African ""big man"" dictatorships such as Togo on the one hand and the more open, stable countries with new pragmatic rulers on the other. This list includes Benin, Eritrea, Mali, Zambia and Uganda as well as South Africa. Africans ""want the same things everybody else wants,"" said Vivian Lowery Derryck, president of the African American Institute in New York, and they are throwing their support to leaders and movements that hold the promise of delivering. She predicted that Sudan and possibly Zaire will break apart, but she said there are several countries where ""pragmatic"" leaders have come to power and where it is reasonable for foreigners to consider investing. ""There is a new class of African business people emerging who are not victims of the past,"" said Frank Savage, a prominent African-American financier whose Alliance Capital Corp. has set up an Africa investment fund. ""They were born after independence. All they want now is a higher standard of living."" ""You would be amazed at how many countries have adopted structural adjustments"" that make them economically attractive, he said. ""It may still be a little early for a lot of investors, but it's time to look at countries that may be investor-friendly,"" such as Ghana, he said. Savage said the worldwide ""commodity cycle"" is favorable to Africa as prices rise in a general economic recovery. A test of his evaluation, and of Africa's interest for potential investors, is scheduled for mid-October, when a major international oil and gas conference assembles in Cape Town, South Africa. This event -- of a type common in Houston, London and Singapore but virtually unknown in Africa -- will bring together oil and gas executives and government officials from all across Africa to assess the natural gas potential of Mozambique, offshore oil exploration in Cameroon, recent natural gas discoveries in Namibia and a score of similar issues. Invitations to this conference from its sponsor, the authoritative trade journal Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, stress that ""many African nations are actively promoting investment through extensive deregulation, privatization and divestment policies."" That is just what the Clinton administration likes to hear, but often does not. ""The policies this administration supports are not necessarily supported by African leaders,"" an administration official said. ""Democracy, open markets, the development of indigenous human rights groups, rural empowerment -- these are not necessarily what African leaders want. They imply political development."" But Africans increasingly understand the need for popular participation in political and economic life, said Roble Olhaye, Djibouti's ambassador to the United Nations. ""They know corruption, nepotism, waste and human rights abuses have to go,"" he said in an interview. ""That is the order of the day."""14-Sep-94,GAMBIA (96%); AFRICA (92%); UNITED STATES (92%);,"To the Editor: For more than eight years Gambia followed International Monetary Fund austerity programs.

The administration, which is quietly but doggedly looking for ways to promote stability and economic reform in Africa, wants Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo to succeed, officials said. But it is restricted in how much it can help him, partly by laws limiting aid to Zaire and partly by uncertainty over how much distance Kengo has really put between himself and Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko. The meetings between Kengo and administration officials were nuts-and-bolts diplomatic work, far from the televised glamour of summits with Boris Yeltsin or red-carpet greetings for Nelson Mandela. But the lack of glitter did not diminish the size of the stakes. Kengo is trying to turn around a potentially rich nation of 40 million people, one quarter the size of the United States in area, that long ago descended into a morass of corruption and ineptitude. Mobutu and other senior officials have reportedly enriched themselves by looting the state while roads, schools and other public facilities fell into ruin and the authority of the central government dwindled. U.S. policy is to encourage what one official called ""credible and transparent elections"" next year that would choose a successor to Mobutu, whom Washington once relied on as an anticommunist ally but no longer needs. The Clinton administration has been preaching that Africa's post-independence era of ""big man"" rule is over and telling Africans that democracy and open markets are the keys to a prosperous future. ""We are not going to support flawed elections that would validate a transition from Mobutu to Mobutu,"" the official said. Kengo, who was prime minister under Mobutu twice before, is now part of Mobutu's restless opposition, chosen by a self-appointed transitional parliament to serve until July 1995, when elections are scheduled. His selection ended a two-year period in which Zaire was virtually paralyzed by having two rival governments, one run by Mobutu and one run by Etienne Tshiskedi, who was chosen prime minister by a national conference in 1992 and still lays claim to the title. ""Since I was elected,"" Kengo said in an interview, ""Mobutu's actions have shown that he is cooperating with the government. We can only judge him on his behavior. Will he change his mind in a month or two months? We don't know."" Kengo challenged Mobutu in dramatic fashion last month when he broke up a racket that was smuggling Zairian currency into the country from printers in Europe without delivering it to the central bank. He ordered the closure of a Lebanese-owned firm allegedly involved in the shipment, withdrew the license of an air freight company that flew in the 30 tons of bills and ordered suspects prosecuted. The U.S. Embassy in Kinshasa issued a statement supporting Kengo and the crackdown, saying ""this effort is of vital importance and ... the credibility of the Zairian government depends directly upon its accomplishment. ... The United States supports the prime minister in this difficult undertaking."" It is not clear why Mobutu, who still controls the army, tolerated this challenge to what one official here called ""the kleptocracy."" One possibility is that he has resigned himself to leaving office next year and wants to avoid provoking the Zairian public in ways that might threaten his wealth. Asked if Mobutu is still enriching himself at the expense of the state, Kengo replied, ""Right now there is nothing to be taken away anymore, because there are no more productive companies."" He said Zaire's diamond exports produce little revenue for the government because military officers and non-Zairian diamond merchants control the trade. An administration official said Kengo is ""a legitimate transition figure"" because as a nonnative of Zaire he cannot run for president himself. He said that ""if Kengo can curb abuses and limit corruption, and if he can establish a reasonable economic program to satisfy the International Monetary Fund and if he can establish a legitimate political process leading to free elections, then he is worthy of a lot of support. That's a lot of ifs."" ""Kengo has made a courageous effort to limit Mobutu's power, at some risk to himself,"" said an administration official who met with him. Washington's problem in trying to support him, this official said, is that current law prohibits direct aid to a government in arrears on U.S. loans, which Zaire is, to the tune of $ 800 million. The fiscal 1995 foreign aid bill, he said, prohibits use of any of the U.S. African Development Fund for Zaire. ""We will try to find other ways to be helpful,"" he said."4-Jun-95,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (92%); LATIN AMERICA (79%); ARGENTINA (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); EUROPE (79%); HAITI (79%); RUSSIAN FEDERATION (72%); EASTERN EUROPE (57%); FRANCE (56%);","WITH THE arrival of James D. Wolfensohn this month, the World Bank will have at its head a man well-equipped to deal with what is arguably the most destructive economic condition hurting low- and middle-income countries -- flight capital. I'm talking about money that moves out of developing and transitional economies into Western bank accounts by means illegal or undocumented. This is not the same as Western speculative capital that flows in and out of emerging markets. That's perfectly legal. Flight capital is hot money from African, Latin American, eastern European and former Soviet countries surreptitiously passing by collusive and illicit means into New York, Miami, London, Paris, Hamburg and Swiss banks. In the process, it distorts free trade, negates foreign aid, worsens inflation, diminishes tax revenues, undermines structural adjustment, delays and imperils democracy and firmly entrenches poverty. Shouldn't a situation that has bled hundreds of billions of dollars, perhaps a half-trillion, from the world's poor receive diligent attention? Theoretically, yes, but how do you solve a problem that most political and economic leaders scarcely want to admit exists? Published financial statistics provide no reliable measure of flight capital, but privately conducted analyses indicate that its magnitude is on the order of $ 50 billion to $ 80 billion annually.  This exceeds the yearly total of foreign aid appropriations of Western governments. Furthermore, a dollar remaining in a developing economy is easily worth several dollars of external assistance. If more money comes out as flight capital than is allocated as foreign aid, and if the deleterious impact of flight capital is a multiple of sums spent on foreign aid, then something is very wrong with the way we are dealing with development issues. Flight capital has impoverished many countries and virtually destroyed others. Zaire has been squeezed back into the 19th century through the disappearance from official coffers of billions of dollars in mineral revenues and external aid. Argentina has experienced flight capital since the 1800s. South Africa suffered from a large flow of flight capital over the past decade, as political violence grew and majority rule approached. Russia has exported so much flight capital -- an estimated $ 50 billion over five years -- that it is difficult to find much evidence of the funds thus far provided by the West. Between Papa Doc, Baby Doc and the generals, Haiti has been bled dry. The list goes on. There are three principal means by which flight capital moves across borders. Black market currency deals coupled with petty smuggling is the smaller part of the problem. Official misappropriation, that is, theft by government officers is a bigger problem. When a dictator, for example Zaire's Mobutu, wants to stash money overseas, he may simply direct the central bank to effect the transfer, usually out of an offshore reserves account. A corrupt leader without dictatorial powers may use a middleman to negotiate the transaction, usually in return for some official concession or contract. Both result in depletion of the country's external reserves, enhancement of the leaders' foreign wealth -- and no questions asked by recipient Western financial institutions. At roughly $ 10 billion to $ 20 billion annually, official misappropriation is not insignificant, and this figure does not include any of the oil-rich kingdoms and sultanates where what is and isn't flight capital is rather moot. The most widely used but deeply concealed means of generating flight capital, however, is trade mispricing, a common element in international transactions. It is particularly preferred in the private sector because it is invisible and tax free. Typically, the owner or manager of a business conspires with the overseas seller of imports or buyer of exports to include an undocumented commission (""kickback,"" ""tangenti,"" ""dessous-de-table"") on the transaction, and the excess funds generated are deposited into an overseas bank account. For example, most traders dealing with Central and South America know that, more often than not, bananas come out with invoices showing less than the real price while linerboard to manufacture export cartons goes in over-invoiced. And, of course, mispricing and misappropriation frequently come together, as with a $ 7 million shipment of U.S. wheat that ended up costing Ivory Coast $ 70 million. Manipulation of trade values occurs on some 30 to 60 percent of import and export transactions of many countries, especially in Latin America and Africa. Commission levels commonly range from 5 to 15 percent. Diversion of 100 percent of the proceeds of some exports out of Russia and other republics of the former Soviet Union is especially troubling to these economies at the present time. Drainage out of poorer countries and transitional economies by the mechanism of trade mispricing alone is on the order of $ 30 billion to $ 50 billion annually. For years, World Bank and IMF officials have sold economic reform programs to poorer countries using the argument, among others, that with correct economic policies flight capital accumulated overseas will in reasonable measure flow back. To the contrary, it is evident that, once out, flight capital rarely returns. The only significant exception is Mexico, largely because it is the only Third World country bordering on a major industrialized democracy. One big reason why few people want to deal with flight capital is that blame lies with both those who generate it and those who solicit and receive it. Flight capital is cooperation among the world's powerful for exploitation of the world's weak. The fact is that for every illegal dollar, pound, franc or mark that moves out of poorer countries, there is a Western trader, manufacturer or financier that directly or indirectly facilitates its receipt. How, then, is it possible to curtail this problem, when many vested interests in richer and poorer countries prefer the status quo? Five reforms would help to ground flight capital: Require the World Bank and IMF -- and urge other international institutions and aid donors -- to strengthen provisions in their own contracts to make flight capital arising from multilateral and bilateral funding onerous and improbable. This will set a tone that will eventually affect private contracts as well. Require countries receiving World Bank and IMF funding to adopt measures that maximize the transparency of trade transactions, such as trade inspection services coupled with uncomplicated buyer/seller declarations. Removing the invisibility of kickbacks removes most kickbacks. Encourage multinational corporations worldwide to adopt policies barring over- and under-invoicing. Securing orders at the expense of the poor forestalls market growth and is in the long term self-defeating. Influence Western bankers -- at the minimum -- to cease soliciting flight capital from foreign countries. Leave bank secrecy laws in place but forego abetting the outflow of money contrary to most nations' laws. Urge Western governments -- with the United States taking the lead -- to combat official misappropriations by more readily freezing the assets of corrupt leaders in or out of office. By contrast to the rest of the developing world, the East Asian private sector has -- for reasons both civic and cultural -- participated far less frequently in illegal transfers of money into Western bank accounts. The Asian decision to keep money at home or in investments that bring profits home has given birth to sound economic policies that protect and multiply retained wealth. While trickle-down economics is at work in Asia, however, trickle-out economics is at work elsewhere. Unfortunately, the East Asian model is not at this time transferable to Africa, Latin America and former communist states. And a disservice is done to other countries by blithely ignoring that flight capital is an overarching reality for much of the globe. Addressing this problem in a sustained manner can correct a serious distortion in the global economy, maximize the benefit of declining foreign aid expenditures and within a reasonable time reverse the course of poverty's growth. Raymond Baker, director of Overecho Associates, has worked extensively on development issues in Latin America, Asia and Africa."30-Dec-95,NIGERIA (99%); UNITED STATES (95%); AFRICA (94%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%);,"In the world according to Nigeria's military rulers, the United States is carrying out a plot hatched long ago to destroy black Africa's most populous country.

And one more thing: Nigerians snared in wrongdoing abroad are not really Nigerians. They are posing as Nigerians because they long to be identified with West Africa's most powerful country. With a blitz of revisionist history, Nigeria's military has undertaken to combat international outrage after it executed nine opponents, including playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa, last month. The campaign has included a video titled ""Not in Our Character,"" a flurry of rallies -- including a Million Man March -- and creation of a 50-man committee whose main task is to buff Nigeria's image. Those in power ""engage in a total distortion of facts,"" said Nosa Igiebor, editor of Tell, an opposition magazine. ""They portray themselves as victims, and they actually believe that. All of this is supposed to be a substitute for substantive changes."" Such campaigns are nothing new to the estimated 100 million people of Nigeria. During nearly three decades in power, military rulers repeatedly have fashioned similar efforts to fight foreign critics. The most recent was the War on Indiscipline and Corruption that Gen. Sani Abacha launched after taking power in late 1993. But that effort did little to distract foreign governments and human rights groups, who continued to lambaste the regime as one of sub-Saharan Africa's most abusive and corrupt. That criticism reached a zenith last month after Abacha's Provisional Ruling Council confirmed death sentences on Saro-Wiwa and the others, convicted in connection with the slayings of four traditional leaders last year. The nine were hanged 10 days after their trial ended. Threats of sanctions that accompanied the resulting international anger goaded Nigeria into its propaganda war, the centerpiece being a huge pro-government demonstration earlier this month. Dubbed Nigeria's version of the Louis Farrakhan-led Million Man March on Washington in October, it featured hundreds of thousands of Nigerians descending on Abuja, the federal capital. Officials maintained that the march was planned by ordinary citizens, although the government arranged for the participants to fly free to the capital, provided food money and placards and promised some demonstrators up to $ 50. Many demonstrators admitted they did not comprehend their placards; some held them upside down. Nigeria has made the United States and Britain primary targets of such rallies. Nigeria's most severe Western critics, they threatened stiff sanctions and recalled their ambassadors after the executions. ""America wants to control us,"" said Walter Ofonagoro, the minister of information and culture, during a session with foreign reporters this month. ""The Cold War is over, so they think we have to obey whatever they tell us."" Ofonagoro, Ivy League-educated, described a ""secret trade war"" that he said the United States is waging against Nigeria. As for the persistent perception that the country's military rulers annuled the 1993 vote, ""The courts canceled the election,"" he said. The reported winner, businessman Moshood Abiola, was imprisoned. ""The judge said the vote was rife with irregularities. It was not a free and fair election,"" said Ofonagoro. In fact, then-ruler Ibrahim Babangida, who had repeatedly pushed back the vote, wiped out the election, charging that the proceedings were a fraud. The action prompted the United States to halt aid. Nigeria's rulers also are scrambling to cleanse the image of Nigerians living abroad. In recent years, hundreds have been arrested on drug charges and for engaging in fraudulent schemes, making many countries wary of awarding them visas. But in the video ""Not in Our Character,"" Col. Ike Nwosu suggested that there has been a mistake. ""What has happened,"" the colonel said, ""is that people want to associate themselves with being Nigerians, with the result that when they want to engage in nefarious activities they use Nigeria as a cover."" The video, which purports to provide historical context for Nigeria's economic and social crises, acknowledges that the nation is far from perfect but asserts that malfeasance and corruption are ""not in our character."" The video blames economic woes on ""internationally imposed economic policies,"" a slap at World Bank and International Monetary Fund efforts to help Nigeria right its economy during the 1980s. The video also assails foreign governments for criticizing Nigeria's stumbling attempts to establish democracy, calling such nations ""disingenuous and dishonest."" The narrator insists that it took the United States and Britain ""centuries . . . to produce viable liberal democratic institutions."" Ultimately, the narrator says, ""most of the problems that confront Nigeria today are rooted in our colonial history."" Nigeria gained its independence from Britain in 1960; the military has held power for most of the time since then. The propaganda efforts stretch down to an area of southern Nigeria known as Ogoniland, the oil-rich region of Saro-Wiwa and the others executed. Officials in Rivers state, where Ogoniland sits, have invited reporters in to investigate accusations by members of the indigenous Ogoni ethnic group. The Ogonis contend that a rush to extract oil had resulted in environmental devastation of their homeland and that they had been deprived of any economic benefits deriving from the oil production. In an interview, Col. Dauda Musa Komo, the Rivers state administrator, said the government ""is not in a defensive mood. . . . We just want people to know the facts."" Later he added that ""military-bashing has become a fashionable thing. . . . But there is no truth in the accusation that the military [are in charge] just because they want power."" Igiebor, the magazine editor, said of the government's public relations effort, ""Ordinary Nigerians are not moved by these shenanigans."""29-Jan-96,KENYA (99%); AFRICA (93%); EASTERN AFRICA (93%); UGANDA (92%); UNITED STATES (79%);,"When President Daniel arap Moi flew to Uganda last week for talks with other East African leaders, he traveled in luxury aboard a brand-new private jet that the taxpayers of this cash-strapped country bought last month for about $50 million. As the jet lifted off from the airport, it banked over the rutted and potholed two-lane highway from Nairobi to Mombasa, Kenya's major port. A vital artery for business, the road is perhaps the most visible symbol of the dilapidated state of the country's infrastructure. On good days, the going is bumpy. On rainy days the road is impassable. Some opposition leaders and diplomats here assert that the jet and the road illustrate what is wrong with the Government's economic priorities: a longstanding tendency among politicians to let personal prestige outweigh the public interest. President Moi purchased the jet, a sleek Dutch-made Fokker, at the same time that his Government was seeking a $50 million low-interest loan from the World Bank to repair the road. Since newspapers disclosed the purchase of the jet in November, Government officials have argued that the expense is justified because in the past the President has had to take one of Kenya Airway's two jets out of service every time he travels. The airplane is one of several expenditures not listed in Kenya's budget that have jeopardized aid from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, as well as from other countries, diplomats and officials at international development banks said. The officials and diplomats, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the jet and two other budget-busting projects of questionable worth have come up during talks this week between the Government and a joint mission from the Bank and the I.M.F. The two sides are trying to hammer out a plan for economic reform that would allow the I.M.F. to release hundreds of millions of dollars in blocked aid. The stakes are high for Kenya, an economic engine for eastern Africa. Hanging in the balance are $200 million in direct aid from the I.M.F. and nearly $166 million in loans from the World Bank for roads and other infrastructure projects that are needed to attract foreign investment. The talks are also being watched by Western countries, including the United States, and several have said the I.M.F.'s decision will be a bellwether for them. Only a fraction of the $800 million donor countries pledged to Kenya in November 1994 has been disbursed because of the stalled negotiations, diplomats said. Neither the I.M.F. nor the World Bank would comment on the talks. But diplomats and people familiar with the talks say the main sticking points have been the Government's inability to stamp out official corruption and the kind of pork-barrel and prestige spending typified by the President's new airplane. Besides the jet, the Government is spending about $85 million to build an international airport at Eldoret, the heart of the President's home state in eastern Kenya. Parliament never approved the project -- the money was tucked away in a special debt service fund in this year's spending plan. It was also hidden from World Bank auditors who scrutinized the budget until a newspaper reported its existence. The Government has argued that the airport is needed because of an economic boom in the area. The growth there has been fueled in large part by flower merchants, who now truck their goods to Nairobi, over pitted roads, for air shipment to Europe. In another deal done without competitive bidding or legislative approval, the Government recently awarded a multi-million-dollar contract to a French company to manufacture identification cards. Paradoxically, the controversies over the airport and the jet come to light as Kenya has made big strides over the last three years toward improving its moribund economy. Last week, the Government suspended a score of high-ranking port officials on corruption charges. Urged by the I.M.F., it has also eliminated import licenses, squeezed the money supply and liberalized trade. As a result, interest rates are down, and the economy grew by 5 percent in 1995, after several years of stagnation. Inflation, which had hit 100 percent in 1993, stayed below 7 percent in 1995. But the population continues to grow faster than the economy, local economists said. So Kenyans, with an average annual income of $1,200, are in reality getting poorer. ""It's a mixed bag,"" said one diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""They would not have achieved what they achieved last year if they hadn't been doing certain things right. But the question is, would they have had 8 percent growth without the corruption."""10-Apr-96,FRANCE (98%); AFRICA (98%); WESTERN AFRICA (95%); COTE D'IVOIRE (94%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (93%); BURKINA FASO (92%); EUROPE (92%); BENIN (92%); TOGO (79%); SENEGAL (79%); NIGER (79%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%); CENTRAL AFRICA (79%); MALI (79%); EASTERN EUROPE (51%);,"Despite political turmoil and tightened international aid budgets, France's former colonies in West Africa have begun to shake off a decade of economic doldrums, benefiting from a temporary combination of good luck and monetary reform. World commodity prices rose suddenly in 1994, boosting economies greatly dependent on exports of cocoa, rubber, cotton, tropical woods and other primary products. As a result, seven former French West African colonies -- Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo -- posted average gross domestic product gains of 6 percent in 1995. Significantly, the economy of the group's locomotive, Ivory Coast, reversed years of recession and grew by 7 percent. These results were just what specialists predicted when France shocked 14 former sub-Saharan African colonies in January 1994 by forcing a 50 percent devaluation of their common currency -- the first realignment between the French franc and African franc since 1948. But just as specialists also had forecast, the overall performance of France's former Central African possessions was less impressive, even though they are potentially better off. No statistics on their economic performance have been issued for 1995, which experts interpret as an indication of unresolved political difficulties, bloated state payrolls and economic mismanagement. Many French-speaking African nations initially had feared the 1994 devaluation was the first step toward radical reduction of the generous aid that successive regimes in Paris had underwritten since the countries gained independence in 1960. French-speaking Africa had a record of government corruption, coups and stagnant growth, and France was confronted by its most serious economic crisis since World War II, a combination many analysts believed would lead the government of prime minister Edouard Balladur to carry out just such an agonizing reappraisal. But such fears disappeared last May when Jacques Chirac, a politician with a wide network of African friends, was elected president of France. So popular was his victory in French-speaking Africa that an Ivory Coast newspaper splashed the words ""We Won"" on its front page. Chirac single-handedly went to bat for Africa despite France's record unemployment, high interest rates and worrisome budget deficit. Alone among Western countries, France at his insistence virtually has maintained its level of assistance to the region at about $ 9 billion a year. That aid, largest among the Group of Seven industrialized democracies, is almost three times more than the slashed U.S. commitment. Last June, Chirac also forced reluctant European Union partners to renew for five years an annual $ 3.44 billion aid package for the southern hemisphere despite their preference for helping the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe, who are themselves potential EU members. In return, the EU donors insisted on closely linking aid to African countries to their respect for democratic practices, human rights and good governance. The stipulations signaled that exasperated donors were no longer routinely willing to condone the excesses of authoritarian mismanagement, dictatorial rule and human rights abuses. Although the new toughness in European aid decisions seems to have brought a measure of reform, African specialists have urged caution, pointing to some backsliding on commitments to fair elections, multi-party democracy and rigorous financial accounting. Indeed, the Rwandan government was rebuffed when it expelled 39 international humanitarian relief agencies and asked the European Union to deliver directly the tens of millions of dollars in aid money the agencies had previously administered. On the human rights front, Cameroon, a haven for extremists from Rwanda's Hutu ethnic majority, arrested Col. Theoneste Bagosera last month on charges of instigating the murder of about a half-million members of the Tutsi minority in 1994. He and 11 other former senior Rwandan officials wanted by the International War Crimes Tribunal investigating the slaughter were to be transferred to The Hague to face trial. In another example, the International Monetary Fund froze aid negotiations with Niger immediately after a military coup ousted the country's first democratically elected president in January. The EU quickly suspended its assistance. France interrupted all but humanitarian aid. The coup leaders caved in this month, agreeing to set new, democratic presidential elections for September as the price for resuming the aid. Although Chirac was initially critical of the devaluation, once in office he embraced the Balladur reforms, subordinating bilateral French aid to acceptance of IMF and World Bank reforms aimed at cutting bureaucratic fat and straightening out tangled finances. Chirac also renewed France's commitment to further democracy, first enunciated in 1990. ""The time of gifts is over,"" said a senior French specialist, explaining this year's 3 percent cutback in French aid. ""The Africans know we cannot help them on the same scale as during the past 35 years."" Officials tracking French African economies at the Paris-based Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development decry the region's lack of meaningful private capital investment. Joao Vale de Almeida, a EU spokesman dealing with Africa, said he is worried that the ""lack of a success story"" on the continent could lead to steep aid cuts when the present agreement expires in 2000. Stoking such pessimism is the failure of concerted donor efforts to force reform on France's former Central African possessions, which include the oil-producing states of Cameroon, Congo and Gabon. The Congo is potentially rich, but has mortgaged its oil revenues until 2012 and refused to reduce its bloated civil service and state corporation payrolls. The finances of Gabon are also precarious, as are those of Cameroon. All three countries have resisted full implementation of IMF reforms. In north-central Africa, Chad is only now emerging from decades of little wars, sometimes involving Libya, at other times pitting southern Bantu farmers against northern Saharan nomads. This month, a referendum approved a constitution providing for a strong presidency, in a significant step toward returning Chad to a state of law. But such a back-to-basics approach has limits, as the politics of Nigeria's tiny neighbor, Benin, demonstrated last month. One-time Marxist Mathieu Kerekou was elected president, despite a messy economic and human rights record in his 17-year reign ending in 1990."16-Jul-96,GHANA (95%); WESTERN AFRICA (93%); AFRICA (92%); BURKINA FASO (79%); COTE D'IVOIRE (79%); NIGER (79%); MALI (79%); GUINEA (79%);,"Just beyond the yellow ""no trespassing"" sign, a burly fellow who calls himself Jangu-man stood ankle deep in chemical-laced black muck. He scooped some of it into a wooden gutter with a dented old army helmet and washed it, letting promising particles gather into a porous brown cloth. Quicksand-like pits have claimed the lives of at least five young men working in the moonscape around the Obuasi gold fields this year, and security forces have killed three and arrested 17 others. But Jangu-man, whose name means ""wild one,"" displayed the confidence of a giddy gambler with nothing left to lose, someone for whom the lure of gold was stronger than the fear of getting shot. Working on the run-off from soil that has already been processed with cyanide and arsenic at Ghana's leading industrial mine, Jangu-man is one of thousands of illegal gold miners across the country who often risk their health and their lives for a chance to strike it rich, or more often, just to keep themselves fed. The men gather around large-scale, licensed mining operations, living off what the big companies throw away or have not yet gotten to. There is plenty to go around, and Ghana, the former Gold Coast, is rapidly becoming a leading producer. Its Ashanti Goldfields Co. is now the world's 10th biggest producer, with its annual yield having grown in the past decade from 200 ounces to nearly 1 million. Ashanti, the only West African company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is leading West Africa into a gold boom that could help the region pull itself out of years of economic decline. Ashanti's expertise is being sought by such regional nations as Mali, Niger, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso and others that have watched Ghana's growth rate climb and its status soar in international circles that have often looked on West African governments with disdain because of their historic reputation for mismanagement and corruption. But fears are mounting over the growing tension between the illegal miners and mining companies in Ghana, as unemployed youths become more desperate to grab a piece of the wealth they see being extracted from around their villages. Economic reforms inspired by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have helped to boost foreign investment here, but they have also inspired resentment among local inhabitants who have reaped little from free-market innovations. ""There's no doubt that gold mining is precipitating a fairly steady increase in social tensions,"" a Western diplomat said. ""This is not a trickle-down type of prospecting,"" he added. ""It has enriched a small number of people at the top but certainly not that many at the bottom. ""You see some fancy cars around town, nice houses, but the lower 40 percent of the population is certainly no better off than they were a generation ago,"" he said. At least 1,000 illegal miners, known as galamsey, a local word that means ""sell it quick,"" armed themselves with blow guns, clubs, knives and machetes last month and attacked Ashanti security men who tried to run them off a particularly rich site. The miners also stole about 50,000 chickens from the company's poultry farm, ransacked the buildings and injured three policemen. ""The whites, they are making all the money; the government must institute a law to employ the local inhabitants here,"" said Blay Marshall Wellington, a secondary school teacher in Tarkwa, a town south of Obuasi. Local residents complain that foreign mining companies overlook them in favor of employees from Accra, the capital. Gold extraction and processing, however, has become increasingly mechanized and often requires the skills of an educated work force. Few local youths are qualified for jobs at Ashanti, having discarded their pencils for shovels when they were as young as 10 years old. The galamsey have been prospecting since Ashanti was established 100 years ago. Their gold fever drives them to extremes even though many of them earn little more than a few dollars a month after laboring six days a week, from sunrise to sunset, in the tropical heat. Five galamsey died of carbon monoxide poisoning in March while trying to pump water from an underground trench. In April, a group of illegal miners ransacked a meteorological station for thermometers containing mercury -- a toxic element they use with their bare hands to process the gold. Mercury can penetrate the skin to lodge in body tissue and bone and can seriously damage the nervous system. In January, the military was called in to drive more than 4,000 galamsey from a forest reserve after they had cut down 55 acres of trees in two months while prospecting. ""Even if there are a lot of jobs, I'd do this because I find this work very lucrative,"" said Anthony Yeboah, 35. ""Farming is too hard. With cocoa it is five to 10 years before you have a product."" The illegal miners sometimes find themselves ignored by their own communities even though they often bring more money into their villages than the big mines do. ""One of the problems is when you are not with one of these companies people will not even look at you,"" said John Kweku, 21, an illegal miner. The government of President Jerry Rawlings has responded to the tension between the galamsey and mining companies by boosting security at the mines and granting more concessions to individual miners. In effect, the government seems to be trying to strike a balance between its use of tax revenues and foreign exchange generated by large-scale gold mining to boost development and its efforts to appease the galamsey so they do not scare off foreign investors. Ghana's gross domestic product has increased by an annual average of 4 percent over the past four years. Mineral exports have accounted for about 40 percent of the country's gross foreign exchange earnings since 1992, compared to about 15 percent in the 1980s. ""This is one of the world's richest gold areas,"" the Western diplomat said. ""With the new extracting processes, West Africa will be one of three or four of the significant gold-bearing areas in the world."" Mining companies from South Africa, Australia, Canada and the United States that operate here often recruit their own security because many local police receive hush money from the galamsey. South African companies are particularly interested in keeping good relations with the illegal miners. ""They knew enough that they couldn't do it a la South Africa or there would have been major trouble,"" said one South African miner, referring to racial tension there prior to the end of white minority rule in 1993. ""You are running the risk of the sort of the political brand of 'Here come all those racist South Africans kicking all the locals off-site.' "" Mining companies in Ghana routinely pay high compensation to communities displaced by surface mining. But the funds often end up lining the pockets of local chiefs and district assemblymen, not in the hands of the most needy. ""It is only the galamsey that have saved the situation"" in many communities,"" said school principal E.K. Ayensu. ""And now the mining companies are asking them to move away from the concessions."""25-Apr-97,AFRICA (94%); UGANDA (94%); UNITED STATES (92%);,"DURING HER recent trip to Africa, Hillary Clinton visited nations that belie the basket-case stereotypes often attached to the entire continent. In Uganda, for example, she praised that nation's democratization, its economic reforms, the ""stunning growth rate"" of its economy and its commitment to primary education for all. Whether Uganda can make good on that revolutionary promise of universal primary schooling is to a large extent being decided in Washington this week and next. Top officials from the Clinton administration and counterparts from other wealthy nations, meeting at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, are debating how to implement a debt relief initiative for developing countries. The terms of debate are dry, but what's at stake is the possibility of reform and renewal. Many developing countries are so burdened by debt that a huge portion of their national income, including the aid they receive, is immediately recycled to banks and governments to the north. Uganda spends about seven times as much on debt repayment as on primary education, while about one-third of its children can't go to school at all -- although education is a crucial prerequisite for development. Blame this heavy burden first and foremost on the poor countries themselves, and on the corrupt regimes that squandered aid year after year. Nations where such regimes still hold sway should be cut off. But last fall, with strong U.S. leadership, the world's leading lenders agreed that nations with a strong commitment to, and record of, reform should get some debt relief, or else even the best policies wouldn't save them. Now lenders will decide which countries will benefit, when and by how much. Some officials want to move slowly, either because they never liked debt relief in the first place or to use the promise of forgiveness as leverage to promote further reform. But reformers throughout the developing world need evidence that this debt initiative is for real -- that swallowing the medicine of economic reform really will bring rewards. For that credibility to be achieved, Uganda, with its long and impressive track record, should be given as much help as possible, and other deserving nations should follow swiftly behind."17-Jun-97,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (93%); CENTRAL AFRICA (79%);","Every day, Western businessmen in suits and ties risk riding in creaking elevators at the Ministry of Mines, an imposing 20-story building on the main street of this capital. They wait on chairs with foam protruding from the cushions for audiences with officials of the new Government in order to buy the right to go into malaria-infested jungles. A Western mining executive, standing before a geological map hanging on the wall outside the minister's office, explained why. ""This is all money,"" he said, his hand sweeping an arc over the eastern rim of this vast country, passing over symbols for cobalt, zinc, magnesium, iron, copper, diamonds and gold. The businessman would not give his name, nor that of his company. If he could have, he would probably have denied his presence in the country. His partner in front of the map would not utter a single word while a reporter was present. The stealth and secrecy reflect a fiercely competitive atmosphere here as mining companies vie for concessions in ""potentially the wealthiest country in the world,"" as the man in front of the map called it. No mineral trader wants to let a competitor know where his lode is. An Australian mining executive said there might be 250 tons of gold, worth $3 billion, to be mined in Congo, the Central African giant formerly called Zaire. At the moment, the gold riches are virtually untouched, he said. Congo is believed to have 80 percent of the world's cobalt reserves. Its copper mines are said to be capable of yielding 500,000 tons a year; they now yield no more than 50,000. The wealth has always been here, of course. But the avarice of the country's longtime former ruler, Mobutu Sese Seko -- bribes were required to get in, and then a share of the action went to a Mobutu crony once business became profitable -- scared away foreign investors for decades. Now, after the collapse of Mr. Mobutu's rule, it is seen as a new day here for business. Laurent Kabila, who was sworn in as president last month after an eight-month push ending the country's civil war, has a guerrilla past and uncertain plans for the future. But his ministers talk like capitalists and have vowed to end corruption. ""Everything I've seen shows they want to govern honestly, that they want foreign investment,"" said W. S. Turner, general manager of Anvil Mining, an Australian company that has signed a copper-mining contract with the new Government. ""As long as that philosophy is there, we're happy to be part of it."" The new Government has slashed the fee for a diamond trading license to $50,000 from $150,000. ""We are trying not to be too greedy; we want to be humble,"" Finance Minister Mwana Mawampanga said. Besides, the state was not really losing anything in cutting the fee; the money, he said, used to go largely into the pockets of Mr. Mobutu and his friends, not into the treasury. There is also a desire for more companies to trade in diamonds. ""We need competition, so our people get the best prices for their products,"" said Mr. Mawampanga, who has advanced economics degrees from Penn State and the University of Kentucky. One monopoly the Government says it intends to break is that of De Beers Consolidated Mines, the South African diamond group under the Anglo American Corporation that was the only company to buy the production of the Congolese state diamond company during the Mobutu era. The Government has not yet decided what it will do with the diamond-mining company, the Societe Miniere de Bakwang, known as MIBA, or with the state mining company known as Gecamines. But officials said in recent interviews that the Government was exploring the possibility of selling large interests in both to one or more international companies. ""We want a market economy,"" Mr. Mawampanga said. ""But we want to ask those companies who come to invest in our country to be good corporate citizens."" The potential for outside investment extends beyond the nation's mineral wealth, with staggering possibilities for public works contracts. In a country of perhaps 50 million people in an area comparable to the United States east of the Mississippi, there is less than 1,500 miles of paved road. Much of the country is not served by telephone. But for now, the focus of the action is in the ground. From Poland to South Africa, from Canada and the United States to Australia and Japan, the mining companies are coming, small, medium and large. The Ministry of Mines says possible investors include another Australian company, Rhodes Mining, as well as several Canadian ones like the Barrick Gold Corporation and the Caledonia Mining Corporation. A Government mining official, Jean-Claude Muyambo, said that many of the companies were trying to take advantage of the lack of experience at the Ministry of Mines. Mr. Muyambo, who is 32, was a human rights lawyer until the new Minister of Mines, Mututulo Kambale, a former professor of English at a teachers' college, asked him to help out. ""They think they are smarter than we are,"" said Mr. Muyambo, whose dark suit, white shirt and tie would have blended in at a New York City law firm but who looked alien in his squalid office -- the carpets beyond threadbare, the walls stained and wires protruding from holes in the ceiling where there should be light fixtures. He said the companies proposed contracts that gave them the right to explore, mine and trade, while paying an amount based only on the right to explore. ""When we tell them something is wrong with the contract, they think we want bribes,"" Mr. Muyambo said. With the stakes so high and Government officials so poor, how is it going to be possible to stop the corruption? ""It's a very good question,"" Bernard Maneno, a senior official in the Ministry of Mines, said with a heavy sigh. But the Government will have to do so if it is serious about attracting foreign investment, Mr. Turner of Anvil Mining said. ""On the technical side, the risks are very low,"" he said, adding that the mineral deposits were high grade, easy to find, easy to mine and easy to process. ""The big issue, he continued, ""is the political risk. The Government doesn't have to do very much to create the right political climate."" A start for Mr. Kabila, Mr. Turner said, would be to create a multiparty democracy. That, he said, would help bring in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, whose financing may be required for large-scale mining projects. And a democracy could give rise to the rules and stable institutions that would spur business confidence in investing in Congo. But the new President has for the present banned political party activity and declared elections to be two years away. So for now, potential investors simply remain hopeful his Government will succeed, and that hope has encouraged all manner of participants in a new gold rush. The other day, Al Andersen, a missionary with the Baptist International Church of Congo, was in the Ministry of Mines in search of a concession. The church's land, it seems, holds a gold deposit. Where? Mr. Andersen, as if taking a cue from the big mining companies' approach, put his hands over the map to cover up the area, in a gesture of mock secrecy. ""I don't want everyone to know where our mines are,"" he said. ""Nobody else is here yet. All the big guys are over there,"" he said, pointing to the east."8-Aug-97,"KENYA (95%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (79%);","The International Monetary Fund, stepping up efforts to combat corruption in the developing world, has adopted a new policy of denying financial assistance to countries where graft threatens to undermine their economic recovery programs. And showing that it means business, the IMF -- which in the past has based most of its lending decisions strictly on economic criteria -- is cutting off a $ 220 million loan to Kenya because of the refusal of Kenyan authorities to clean up pervasive bribery and self-enrichment. Kenya's currency has plunged as much as 20 percent this week as a result. The moves are among the most significant in a series of recent measures taken against corruption by aid agencies, Western governments and international organizations. They come in the wake of criticism aimed at the IMF and other aid donors over the blind eye that they allegedly turned toward rampant bribe-taking in Zaire during much of Mobutu Sese Seko's 32-year reign. Mobutu's corruption and repression spurred a rebellion that toppled him in May, and the nation was renamed Congo. The IMF's new policy, enshrined in guidelines approved Monday by its board, does not mean that IMF money will be withheld from any country where payoffs are common. Rather, it amounts to a warning that the IMF may pull the plug on a country when it believes corruption to be so corrosive as to endanger the attainment of goals specified in a recovery plan. ""Financial assistance from the IMF . . . could be suspended or delayed on account of poor governance,"" the guidelines state, ""if there is reason to believe it could have significant macroeconomic implications that threaten the successful implementation of the program, or if it puts in doubt the purpose of the use of IMF resources."" ""The guidelines are very important,"" said Frank Vogl, vice chairman of Transparency International, an anti-corruption advocacy group. ""It's long overdue that multilateral organizations involved in financing developing countries place on a par with macro policies the basic soundness of the government institutions with which they're dealing."" The cutoff of the loan to Kenya, he added, ""sends a signal, especially because the guidelines are being issued at around the same time."" Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi blasted the IMF's decision as ""purely political,"" according to press reports from Nairobi. The developments reflect a rising determination in Western capitals, especially Washington, to crack down on corruption. IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and World Bank President James D. Wolfensohn have vowed in major policy addresses to take action based on research showing that bribe-taking by public officials tends to impede development, because scarce government funds are funneled into unproductive investments to earn payoffs. The guidelines state that the IMF should not ""interfere in domestic or foreign politics"" of a borrowing country. But they call for its employees to point out the economic consequences of corrupt practices that they may perceive during the periodic consultations they hold with government officials from the IMF's 131 member countries. And in the cases of countries borrowing from the IMF that have been judged to be seriously plagued by corruption, its staff might insist, for example, on ""the removal of individuals from involvement in particular operations where corruption had occurred,"" according to the guidelines. The Kenya loan was suspended late last week because anti-corruption measures the government was taking ""fall short of meeting the clearly expressed concerns of IMF member countries in the area of governance,"" according to an IMF statement. The suspension came just before the board's approval of the guidelines. An IMF official said the move was ""probably the first time that we have said openly that governance issues were at stake"" in such a decision. The suspension followed the Kenyan government's dismissal of its top customs official, Samuel Chebii, who is widely regarded as a crusader for cleaning up corruption in the nation's notoriously graft-ridden ports."11-Aug-97,KENYA (93%); HONG KONG (92%); UNITED STATES (92%); ASIA (79%); CAMBODIA,"At their last annual meeting for the world's finance ministers, the World Bank's president, James D. Wolfensohn, and the International Monetary Fund's managing director, Michel Camdessus, announced that for the first time they would use their leverage with poorer nations to stamp out corruption and to promote better governance. As the finance ministers prepare to gather in Hong Kong next month for the next annual meeting, the first fruits of that new policy are starting to become visible. This month the Monetary Fund sent the Kenya shilling and the Nairobi stock market into a tailspin. It suspended a $220 million loan to Kenya after President Daniel arap Moi failed to create the powerful new anticorruption authority the fund had demanded and to reinstate Samuel Chebii, who had been dismissed as Commissioner for Customs and Excise. Mr. Chebii had earned a formidable reputation for combating graft, to the Government's evident discomfort. At the same time, the fund's executive board, which represents its member governments, formally agreed that all such assistance to third-world countries can be suspended as a matter of course in the future if government corruption is found to be having an adverse effect on a nation's economic development. The World Bank uses the faith and credit of its member countries to borrow inexpensively on financial markets and lends that money to poorer nations. The fund makes loans to distressed governments provided that they adopt policies it favors. While the fund said it was not changing its traditional view that reducing inflation, controlling Government spending and promoting ""macroeconomic stability"" remain the principal keys to growth, it made clear that it would put increased emphasis on fighting corruption and promoting better governance in countries it aids. Financial assistance ""could be suspended or delayed on account of poor governance, if there is reason to believe it could have significant macroeconomic implications,"" state new guidelines on governance questions adopted by the fund's board earlier this month. The fund also showed a new readiness this month to interpret what it means by good governance quite broadly when it persuaded Romania to cancel a planned $1 billion purchase of 96 Cobra attack helicopters from an American company, Bell Helicopter, a division of Textron Inc. Romania had hoped the purchase of sophisticated American military hardware would speed its entry into NATO, although the alliance's secretary general, Javier Solana, said the purchase was unnecessary. The fund contended that such a large arms purchase risked disrupting the economic reforms to which Romania had agreed in return for a loan, by shifting money away from health and education programs that the fund considers more important for the country's successful transition to capitalism. Last year the fund also showed its teeth in Asia by suspending disbursements on a $120 million loan to Cambodia for six months after anticipated Government revenues from logging concessions did not materialize. Next month, it will be the World Bank's turn to publish a three-pronged plan for combatting corruption and promoting better governance. The bank already took the first step last year when it tightened procurement rules governing contracts financed by the $19 billion in loans it disburses annually, saying it will disqualify companies it considers corrupt and require those bidding for contracts to open their books to the bank's auditors. The bank also is to recruit more procurement specialists to oversee the awarding of contracts, at an annual cost of $13 million, and to encourage third-world governments to include a pledge in projects it finances to take steps to prevent bribery. Finally, it plans to step up assistance to governments developing anticorruption strategies. It is already helping several countries develop strategies, including Latvia, Tanzania, Uganda and Ukraine. Unlike the fund -- which usually makes just one loan to a government and which can suspend it at will -- the bank tends to have several loans outstanding at the same time in various sectors of any third-world country's economy where conditions may vary considerably. So it plans a more selective approach to delinquent countries, making decisions on its lending on a project-by-project basis until it is satisfied with the way they are all being run. ""You will see us giving a much higher profile to governance and corruption concerns in a selective way, delaying disbursement until we are satisfied, or suspending it altogether"" said Masood Ahmed, who is coordinating the bank's new policies in this area. In an early example of this approach, Mr. Wolfensohn recently delayed the $70 million second installment of a $150 million loan to a Kenyan energy project because of doubts about the way it was being run. He also delayed a health services loan to Kenya until the bank was satisfied with procurement procedures. The bank also has suspended operations in several countries where it believes its money is unlikely to benefit ordinary people because of endemic corruption and inefficiency -- including Nigeria, the Sudan, Congo and Afghanistan. In deciding to fight corruption and promote better government, both institutions have had to reinterpret requirements in their own bylaws that all lending should be based on economic considerations alone and should take no account of a country's politics. In its new governance guidelines, the fund makes clear that its judgments still ""should not be influenced by the nature of a political regime of a country, nor should it interfere in domestic or foreign politics of any member."" But it also concedes that staff ""may need to be prepared to face some tension in the working relationship with country authorities in specific cases potentially involving corrupt practices."" Both institutions now contend that corruption and bad governance are in themselves obstacles to economic development, as are poor education, inadequate infrastructure and an ineffective health care system, all of which they have previously accepted as within the scope of their responsibility."17-Aug-97,KENYA (94%); RWANDA (92%); AFRICA (92%); EASTERN AFRICA (92%); UGANDA (92%);,"The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have provided the summer's most welcome change in the way global finance and business operate. But they have also furnished a jarring reminder to prognosticators that things often fail to work out as we think they will. Kenya is at the center of the international bankers' reforms and the failure of past conventional wisdom. Because of corruption, the two world financial institutions have suspended loans to the government of President Daniel arap Moi, who also faces bloody street protests because of his dictatorial rule. When I lived in Kenya in the early 1970s as Africa correspondent for The Post, there were two firm bits of conventional wisdom about that beautiful East African nation: One was that Moi, a politician of limited intellectual ability who hailed from a minor tribe, was a transitional figure who could not survive long as president. The other was that Kenya's resources, international visibility and dynamic society should enable it to overcome its crippling internal ethnic rivalries and become a great African success story. Neither prediction looks very good today. Moi's unshakable hold on power for nearly 20 years has been accompanied by a steady decline in the nation's stability and prosperity. There can be little doubt now that the two factors are intimately connected. When the Central Intelligence Agency commissioned an independent study on why states fail two years ago, political leadership was listed among the leading indicators of national catastrophe. East Africa today provides confirmation of this in several ways. Uganda and Rwanda, after enduring terrible bloodlettings and economic collapse, have emerged from their times of trouble with secure and assertive political leadership. Rwanda's Paul Kagame and Uganda's Yoweri Museveni have, through their support of change in the Congo, sketched the basis for a promising regional alliance that is likely to gain increasing international support. But they still must overcome the other failed-state criteria the CIA-commissioned study lists: infant mortality, population pressure, closed trade borders, weather, ethnic tensions and more. The study recommended an official ""watch list"" of countries that get in the trouble zone. It is unclear if the agency ever established such an indelicate document for policymakers. A Michelin guide to political turmoil could be a bestseller in international circles. But you can understand the agency's reluctance to acknowledge that it is watching for three-star hellholes to come. Imagine the hurt feelings, and expulsions of spooks, that would follow. Would a country like Kenya make such a list today, despite all the advantages it still has over its neighbors? It is a measure of Kenya's intrinsic strength that it has been going downhill every year for two decades in the eyes of many of its citizens, former residents and visitors, but still works as a center of global tourism and as a regional headquarters for business and international organizations. The pragmatism of founding President Jomo Kenyatta and his advisers -- as well as the munificence of Kenya's glorious wildlife reserves, tea and coffee plantations and seaside resorts -- gave Moi a substantial heritage to squander after he came to power in 1978, on Kenyatta's death. Moi had been chosen as Kenyatta's vice president in part to secure a tribal alliance between Kenyatta's Kikuyu and Moi's Kalinjin followers. The Kikuyu politicians who squabbled over succeeding Kenyatta let Moi come to power on the theory that they could easily manipulate him and toss him aside later. That was a disastrous miscalculation. Moi divided and conquered the Kikuyu, shuffling the army and internal security commands into the hands of his tribesmen and allies. He let corruption flourish to buy off his more pliable opponents, using harsher measures against others. But Moi's misrule is now being challenged in the streets of Nairobi, where his police killed five demonstrators in one recent protest, and in the board rooms of the world's leading international financial institutions. In a departure from past practice, the International Monetary Fund this month suspended a $ 220 million loan to Kenya because Moi failed to create a strong anti-corruption authority demanded by the fund. The World Bank has also recently delayed smaller loans to Kenya because of concern about corruption. This apparently coordinated squeeze on official corruption in Kenya -- and presumably elsewhere in the future -- is a welcome innovation. International organizations have for too long averted their eyes and treated corruption as an internal matter beyond their reach. Flagrant corruption that is tolerated or assisted by national governments is not a matter of sovereignty. It is a cancer on the international system as well as on the national state. It should be identified and fought far more quickly than it has been in the past. The predicament becomes even more acute as Russia and China pursue their efforts to integrate into the global economy. The forms of corruption that plague these two ex-centrally planned economies differ, but raise many of the same problems present in Kenya. Corruption on a national scale is a proper target for international condemnation and action as well as intelligence scrutiny."22-Aug-97,KENYA (99%); UNITED STATES (92%); EUROPE (79%); JAPAN (79%);,"A Kenyan court charged 62 suspects today with robbery and violence during a raid on a police station that began a week of attacks around this port city that some observers said were politically motivated. Despite the political turmoil, the International Monetary Fund said it was sending a team to Kenya for talks on resuming aid. ""To show our goodwill in this respect, I have asked a mission to leave immediately for Nairobi,"" the Fund's managing director, Michel Camdessus, told reporters in Washington. He said the decision followed a personal appeal from President Daniel arap Moi. The I.M.F. suspended a $205 million, three-year loan to Kenya on July 31 citing concerns over corruption. The World Bank followed suit and delayed disbursements. Mr. Moi, 73 and in power since 1978, faces elections later this year for which no date has been set. He had accused the I.M.F. of acting on political grounds. The 62 suspects in Mombasa court were accused of robbing the police station at Likoni on Aug. 13, killing a policeman, stealing weapons including 40 rifles and damaging property. They were also charged with arson and taking an unlawful oath binding them to kill if called on to do so. The maximum penalty for robbery with violence is death. The accused included Amir Hamisi Ali Banda, prayer leader of a mosque south of Mombasa, and Ali Said Chidzondo, chairman of the unregistered National African Democratic Union. All denied the charges and were scheduled to appear again in two weeks. Security forces beat the opposition leader Raila Odinga and damaged his car today when he tried to visit the Likoni police station with other opposition activists, local journalists said. ""One of them hit me with the butt of his gun on the side of my head,"" Mr. Odinga told reporters.""This confirms our fears that the Government has something to hide."" A police spokesman, Peter Kimanthi, said he was unaware of the incident. But he confirmed that the police had shot and killed a man at Tiwi village south of Mombasa on Wednesday. This took the toll from nine days of violence to 40 dead. Six policemen and seven civilians including five attackers were killed on Aug. 13 in the well-organized attack on the Likoni police station, just south of Mombasa. Mr. Kimanthi said the police recovered a rifle today and 50 rounds of ammunition and arrested 101 people, taking the number of arrests since Aug. 13 to at least 410. President Moi and the opposition have blamed each other for fueling tribal tensions on the coast. Missions of 10 European countries, the United States and Japan welcomed an agreement in principle by Government and opposition to start talks before elections. ""We urge both sides to enter into dialogue in the spirit of compromise and with the commitment to agree on reforms necessary to ensure free and fair elections,"" they said in a statement. The attacks on the coast, the center of Kenya's tourism and its top foreign currency earner, have shaken the industry and tour operators say cancellations have increased. Tourism earned $465 million in 1996 and is Kenya's top employer. About 60 percent of last year's 770,000 tourists went to beaches to the north and south of Mombasa."23-Aug-97,KENYA (99%); UNITED STATES (93%);,"The United States criticized corruption and violence in Kenya today and warned the government that international donors might not resume aid on the basis of old promises. Gunmen shot and killed two Kenyans in a raid on a church south of the Indian Ocean city of Mombasa today, taking the death toll from 10 days of ethnic attacks in the area to 42. President Daniel arap Moi arrived on his first visit to the turbulent coast. He was due to visit the Mombasa Agricultural Show scheduled to open Monday. U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell said in a hard-hitting speech in Nairobi that ""Kenya is sending very mixed signals at a time when it is host to ominous events."" She added that Kenyan leaders said they did not want violence while clashes were breaking out in Nairobi, on the Indian Ocean coast and elsewhere. ""Kenya's government says it is serious about economic reforms and combating corruption, yet it has chosen to risk economic instability rather than see its promises through to completion,"" she said. ""We hear commitments to free and fair elections, but the political playing field remains decidedly uneven."" The violence has rocked Kenya's tourist coast since an Aug. 13 raid on police posts at Likoni, outside Mombasa city. Thousands of people have fled the region south of Mombasa and returned to their homes deeper in Kenya since the troubles began. Coast natives accuse outsiders of taking many of the jobs and homes, and much of the land available along the Kenyan coast. Police have been hunting down thugs armed with rifles and machetes in the past nine days. More than 400 people have been arrested. The church raiders shot into a compound packed with 2,500 people who had taken refuge there, killing a man and a woman and seriously wounding a policeman in the mouth, witnesses said. Bushnell said the government had to choose to reduce services or raise taxes to cover a $ 141 million shortfall in this year's budget because International Monetary Fund aid has been blocked. The Kenyan shilling strengthened today after news that an IMF delegation would arrive Monday in Nairobi to decide on a date for resuming negotiations on a key aid package, which was halted July 31 because of high-level graft. Moi has blamed the opposition for fueling ethnic tensions. The opposition charges that Moi's supporters are responsible for the violence. Moi, 73, in power for 19 years, has promised some political reforms and dialogue but has refused to talk to an opposition-backed alliance that has held rallies since May to support political change."5-Oct-97,KENYA (96%);,"The political stalemate that has led to violence here over the last six months has been broken, after President Daniel arap Moi's agreement last week with opposition leaders on reforms that would level the playing field somewhat before the coming election. Opposition leaders and diplomats said it remained to be seen if the governing party would carry out the reforms as promised, or if the police and local officials would follow the laws once they were enacted. But as debate began on the bills in Parliament, hopes for a peaceful election began rising here in the capital as well as in the port city of Mombasa, where more than 50 people have been killed in ethnic clashes since August. ""It looks like a big breakthrough,"" a diplomat said, insisting on anonymity. ""The big question is: will the reforms be implemented in sufficiently good faith?"" Diplomats said the proposed reforms are not mere window dressing. If passed, they would mark significant concessions by Mr. Moi, who only three months ago vowed that he would allow no political changes before the general election, which must be held by the end of this year. Mr. Moi, 73, has been in power since 1979 and is a product of the one-party system erected by Jomo Kenyatta, the country's first President. He resisted multiparty democracy until 1992, when domestic and international pressure finally forced Kenya's Government to change. But for the first free election in 1992, Mr. Moi's party -- the Kenya African National Union -- used the machinery of the state to undercut challengers. Mr. Moi garnered the largest block of votes, about 38 percent, because the opposition splintered along tribal lines and could not unite behind a single candidate. This year, the major opposition leaders vowed they would not take part in the election unless the rules were changed to give challengers a better chance and unless civil liberties were expanded. More than a dozen people were killed in prodemocracy demonstrations over the summer. The unrest undermined Kenya's tourist industry and battered its currency. With the economy reeling, Mr. Moi and his Cabinet appeared to be in trouble just a month ago. Not only was Kenya facing international condemnation for violently breaking up demonstrations, but it was also fending off threats from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to suspend aid because of official corruption. Over the last three weeks, however, moderate backbenchers from the governing party reached out to moderate opposition leaders in Parliament and found some common ground, politicians and diplomats said. Some older opposition politicians said the umbrella coalition that had organized the summer's protests had been taken over by radicals intent on overthrowing Mr. Moi rather than changing the Constitution. Many moderates in the coalition became disenchanted with the movement after protesters beat two police officers to death at a rally in early August. ""I found out that we had reached a stage where, for us who were purely for reforms, we were being taken for a ride,"" said Martin Shikuku, an opposition party leader and presidential aspirant. ""We folded up the umbrella, and we went into discussions, and the result is that we have managed to get much more than we envisioned."" Later Mr. Moi endorsed the raft of reforms that moderates on both sides of the aisle had hammered out in Parliament. Diplomats say his change of heart appears to be motivated partly by the threat of a loss of foreign aid and tourism. But in practice, the proposed bills have also divided his political enemies and tripped up the coalition of civil-rights advocates, clergy and politicians who had been pressing for constitutional change. Some of the more radical civil-rights advocates and opposition leaders are still holding out for greater changes, saying the proposed reforms are cosmetic. But they are having trouble rallying support. A protest called last weekend to burn voter-registration cards drew only a handful of people. The reformers' umbrella coalition -- known as the National Convention Executive Council -- has called off strikes scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday. Among other things, the bills would do away with sedition laws that give the Government the right to hold people without trial for political reasons, and would grant greater freedom of assembly. They would also make the police department independent of the governing party and make it a felony for the police to harass or jail people on political grounds. The reforms would also expand the electoral commission to give opposition parties 10 more seats."29-Oct-97,AFRICA (95%); UNITED STATES (94%); EUROPE (92%); ASIA (92%); ERITREA (79%); RWANDA (79%); NORTH AMERICA (79%); JAPAN (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (71%);,"U.N. AMBASSADOR Bill Richardson set off for Africa last week bad-mouthing his own chances of success. Yet the U.N. ambassador managed to secure from Congo President Laurent Kabila a promise to allow, finally, a U.N. investigation of massacres and human rights abuses. It's too soon to know whether these welcome words will be backed up with action. But it's not too soon for the United Nations, United States and other interested parties to take maximum advantage of the opening Ambassador Richardson and President Kabila have provided. ""We are looking at a more coherent overall policy for the Great Lakes region,"" Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said yesterday. That's an urgent task. The turmoil that has rocked financial markets from Asia to North America to Europe in recent days has left Africa largely unscathed -- not because Africa is more economically sound but because it so much less integrated into the world economy. At a time like this, that might seem an advantage -- but it's not. While incomes in Asia have grown over the past two decades -- and will likely continue to grow despite the current troubles -- Africa risks being left behind altogether. Now, though, a new generation of self-made, self-confident leaders has come to power in much of the continent, from South Africa north to Eritrea. Their record is short thus far and mixed, but many of them proclaim a commitment to reining in corruption, promoting economic growth, fostering more responsive government and tying their nations to the world economy. The Great Lakes region at the continent's heart, and particularly Congo with its 65 million people, are crucial to this movement, and to Africa's stability. Mr. Kabila's performance thus far has been disappointing -- particularly his refusal to permit a U.N. inquiry into credible allegations of massacres and terrible mistreatment of refugees. He and others in the region are suspicious of the United Nations and Western nations, in part because they propped up the dictator Mobutu for so many years, in part because the West did little to prevent genocidal massacres in Rwanda in 1994. That resentment, however, cannot excuse Mr. Kabila's stonewalling. His progress makes possible a measure of progress in other parts of the West's relationship with Congo. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund should join with the United Nations, the United States, Japan and the European Union to fashion a constructive policy. One element must be relief from Mobutu's massive debts. Aid and trade must figure in too. This isn't something the United States can do alone, but it's something that isn't likely to happen at all without U.S. leadership."15-Feb-98,KENYA (97%); UNITED STATES (94%);,"No one has to tell Bernard Mulei that the Kenyan economy is in deep trouble. He hawks tours to passers-by in downtown Nairobi, and these days tourists are as scarce as the endangered species he entices them to see. ""High season, we used to get five or six tourists a day,"" he said, as he scanned the busy street for foreigners and found none. ""Now you might get one. Some guys go two or three weeks without getting anything."" A month after President Daniel arap Moi won re-election to a fifth term, his Government is facing the monumental task of putting back together an economy shattered by torrential rains, political upheaval, ethnic violence, a steep drop in tourism and the suspension of foreign aid. Diplomats have taken the opportunity in recent weeks to push Mr. Moi and his allies once again to take a stronger stand against official corruption, suggesting that a resumption of foreign aid and low-interest loans to Kenya might hinge on such actions. ""Kenya's between a rock and a hard place economically,"" one diplomat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ""They really need this money. That's the only leverage we have."" Some diplomats have also used their leverage to urge the Government to do more to stop ethnic clashes in the Rift Valley, which have taken at least 100 lives in the last three weeks. Coming after months of political tension and demonstrations, the violence has scared away investors and tourists, business leaders said. Though the election on Dec. 29 was generally peaceful, since then Mr. Moi's supporters from his Kalenjin ethnic group have clashed repeatedly in the Rift Valley with Kikuyu people, who by and large supported their kinsman, Mwai Kibaki, the runner-up. The police and local authorities have been slow to respond to attacks on Kikuyu families, diplomats said. The United States has been at the forefront in pressuring Mr. Moi to put an end to the violence. Last weekend, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, President Clinton's special envoy for democracy, visited the region where the killing has been taking place, talked to victims and then met with President Moi on Monday. In the meeting, Mr. Jackson said, he told Mr. Moi that regardless of how the violence began, the United States was expecting some ""hands-on"" leadership from Mr. Moi in bringing the clashes under control. He also urged opposition leaders, who have accused Mr. Moi of orchestrating the attacks, to ""cool down provocative rhetoric."" Mr. Jackson said that Kenya's economic recovery was being crippled by the violence, and he suggested that aid from the United States and American support for loans might be jeopardized. ""There is a debate about who started it,"" Mr. Jackson said. ""There can be no debate about whose responsibility it is to end it. The Government must do it."" Mr. Jackson's visit came as Kenyan officials met with a delegation from the International Monetary Fund for the first time since the Washington-based lending institution suspended a $205 million low-interest loan to Kenya last July, citing rampant corruption among top officials. Issues in the talks included several promises Kenya made last August to persuade the fund to restore the loans, including a commitment to crack down on official graft and improve efficiency among civil servants. The fund's decision on resuming aid is seen as critical to Kenya's economic future. It is usually a guidepost for other donor countries, who together provide about $500 million in aid annually. A series of disasters have beset Kenya's economy in the last six months. Heavy rains and floods wiped out roads and bridges, twice cutting the main highway to the port of Mombasa in the last month. The rains have destroyed crops as well, crippling production of coffee, tea, corn, wheat, beans, rice and sugar. The drop-off has hurt exports and caused local prices to soar. The deluges have also caused epidemics of malaria and cholera, overburdening a creaking health care system at a time when nurses were on strike. The floods also contributed to an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever, a rare illness that has killed at least 600 people and thousands of livestock in the last three months. The political and ethnic turbulence before the December election also hurt this nation of game parks and beach resorts, where tourism is the largest earner of foreign exchange. Kenya's balance of payments was hit hard by a $280 million decline in tourism receipts because of ethnic clashes on the Indian Ocean coast in the second half of 1997. Then in January, when more clashes over land and political allegiances erupted between Kikuyu and Kalenjin ethnic groups in the Rift Valley, tourists and foreign investors continued to keep their distance. ""Foreign investors are not very comfortable with the political situation right now,"" said Lincoln Ndwiga, a Nairobi stockbroker. ""They are the big players. If they shy away, so do the local investors."" To make fiscal matters worse, strikes in December forced the Government to agree to labor settlements with teachers and other civil servants that provided for a tripling of salaries, which is likely to add millions in unexpected expenditures to the $3.1 billion annual budget. ""We definitely need an important infusion of foreign aid,"" the new Foreign Minister, Bonaya Adhi Godana, said. ""Obviously we would be glad to have had it not only restored but increased."" These problems would have been tough for any government to handle, but there is ample evidence that Kenya's has not been particularly well managed in recent years, diplomats and foreign economists say. The country's infrastructure has visibly crumbled in the last five years, despite millions of dollars in loans from the World Bank for improving roads. On average, the Government completes only about 3 percent of its capital projects each year, a fraction of the average for most countries.  Even though the World Bank has approved nearly $600 million in loans for major projects, it has been able to disburse only about $30 million because the Government has been so slow to get projects off the ground, officials said. In addition, Kenya's civil payroll is bloated with nearly 485,000 workers. The country is also paying horrendously high interest rates of more than 25 percent on its treasury bills and commercial debts. About a third of the budget goes for debt service, most of it to domestic banks. The budget deficit is expected to balloon to around 4 percent of this year's domestic output. Few resources are left over for building roads, hospitals, schools. ""This is catastrophic,"" said one diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""You can't develop a country with these kinds of numbers."" Map of Kenya showing the location of the Rift Valley: The Rift Valley has repeatedly been hit by ethnic clashes."21-May-98,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (96%); AFRICA (94%); CENTRAL AFRICA (79%);","For a brief moment last May, when his fighters swept into this capital and put an end to Africa's longest dictatorship, Laurent Kabila, the new President, loomed huge on the political stage as a national hero and as Africa's brightest star. But the last year has seen one of Africa's most dramatic unravelings of a political honeymoon. From the nightclubs of Kinshasa, where couples dance the dombolo, a step created to mock the President's ponderous style, to the offices of both African and Western diplomats who once toasted him, people are already concluding that the bright promise of Mr. Kabila's presidency has all but evaporated and wondering aloud how things could have gone so wrong. The people of Congo, formerly Zaire, cheered Mr. Kabila, hoping for an end to years of poverty and decline under the corrupt rule of Mobutu Sese Seko. The neighboring countries that sponsored his seven-month insurgency boldly predicted a new era of stability and growth. Western donors and foreign investors were eager to do business again with a country whose vast inventory of mineral wealth had earned it the sobriquet of Central Africa's geological scandal under Mr. Mobutu. But a year later, cross-border violence still percolates in the country's east. Ethnic tensions, both new and old, abound. Mining investment has been slowed in part because the Government broke off some of its early contracts and investors are leery of instability. And with the new Government increasingly inclined toward the repressive tactics of its predecessors, dreams of democracy have begun to fade. ""We were so happy to see the arrival of Kabila's fighters that we all went into the streets to applaud them, our children brought them water to drink, our wives supplied them food,"" Crespin Muteba, a 54-year-old, long-unpaid postal worker, said as his friends shook their heads in acknowledgment. ""People were expecting a sweet future for our country, but what he has served us instead is bitter lemon."" Foreign donors have all but recoiled from promises of major reconstruction assistance for the country because the new Government's dictatorial tendencies -- from its decision to rule by decree, ban opposition political activity and sharply proscribe work by human rights groups -- that have increasingly drawn unflattering comparison to Mr. Mobutu. Asked in a rare interview what kind of balance sheet he himself would draw up for his one-year-old rule, Mr. Kabila recently told the French radio, ""The successes are many and the failures almost nonexistent."" But an African diplomat from a country whose Government had strongly backed Mr. Kabila offered a starkly different take. ""Sometimes you just have to scratch your head and wonder what it is with this leadership,"" he said. ""When they came to power, they had the world at their feet. But ever since it is almost as if they had deliberately gone out of their way to turn people off."" Mr. Kabila's defeat of the Mobutu dictatorship was hailed as a model of African nations' taking charge in their own back yards. In September 1996, Rwanda and Uganda, weary of the cross-border raids by Hutu refugees into Rwanda that were destabilizing that country and deeply traumatized by the 1994 genocide of the Tutsi minority, started the uprising that spawned Mr. Kabila's rebellion. His Main Fighters: Foreigners on Loan After an early series of successes in breaking up Hutu refugee camps and routing Mr. Mobutu's ragged army, Mr. Kabila was plucked from obscurity and put in charge of the army that would eventually overthrow the terminally ill dictator. But the sources of Mr. Kabila's early strength also foreshadowed much of his weakness. Mr. Kabila arrived in Kinshasa only nominally in charge of an army whose principal fighters were foreigners on loan from Rwanda, or long-exiled members of Zaire's tiny Tutsi minority. In the capital, and eventually throughout much of the country, the image of Mr. Kabila as conquering hero quickly gave way to the humiliating image of the new leader as a hostage to Rwanda, a country one one-hundredth the size of Congo. The new troops did not speak the language of western Congo and were seen as unusually stern and trigger-happy. At first, Mr. Kabila appeared in public surrounded by Rwandan bodyguards. And to compound the problem, his Government contained what many Congolese said was a disproportionately large number of Tutsi ministers. Mr. Kabila's Rwandan problem was made worse by the fact that even before his victory, troops belonging to his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo were accused of carrying out widespread massacres of the Hutu refugees. The international community was insisting on a thorough United Nations investigation of the accusations, something diplomats said Mr. Kabila's Rwandan and Ugandan allies could not have wished for. Aware that his heavy reliance on Rwanda was becoming a liability, Mr. Kabila increasingly turned to other African allies, particularly Angola. With its help, he resorted to a reflex heavily used by Mr. Mobutu himself, and one that would bring new problems of its own. Mr. Kabila, a southerner, stocked the army with ethnic kinsmen who had spent years of exile across the border in Angola and surrounded himself more and more with southern advisers. Soon Mr. Kabila's Tutsi troops began to react to their perceived loss of influence. And recent months have seen shoot-outs between predominantly Tutsi soldiers and units drawn from other parts of the country. In the country's far east, where native Tutsi are numerous, meanwhile, Tutsi units have mutinied outright. ""For the Tutsi, the new Congo became a Frankenstein; something they helped create, but can no longer control,"" a Western diplomat said. ""Now they feel as threatened as they did before the start of the war."" Mr. Kabila's management of the country's political scene has scarcely brought brighter results. He has banned political activity by anyone but his own party, setting his new Government on an immediate collision course with the longtime civilian opposition to Mr. Mobutu and its popular leader, Etienne Tshisekedi. Less than a month after Mr. Kabila took power, student protests and increasingly vocal grumbling by citizens over the political restrictions had become the order of the day.  Despite these early troubles, Western governments largely kept faith with the new Government, promising large amounts of economic aid in return for major reforms. Despite crackdowns on the opposition, Washington praised Mr. Kabila's promise to organize elections within two years. And to the deep frustration of a political class prohibited from organizing, American diplomats counseled forbearance over sweeping restrictions. As if One Dictatorship Replaced Another ""We felt as if one dictatorship was being replaced by another, and were surprised to hear the West telling us to give them the time to settle in,"" said Marcel Mbayo, a senior official of Mr. Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress, the country's largest political party. ""That's like telling someone to stop breathing for two hours and afterwards you will feel better."" The West's support for Mr. Kabila had its first serious test as the new Government tried to frustrate a United Nations investigation of the alleged wartime massacres by his troops. Patience with Mr. Kabila began to fray openly late last year, however, as Washington and other Western capitals grew increasingly embarrassed by a deepening streak of authoritarianism and a lack of any clear approach to the country's immense problems. When Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright visited Kinshasa in December, American officials still seemed largely protective of Mr. Kabila, volunteering to journalists that Washington was ""interested in more than human rights"" in Congo. Indeed, through various nongovernmental organizations, the United States has cleared the way for some $10 million in funds. Ms. Albright, however, was deeply embarrassed to learn of a wave of political arrests in the country, as well as by Mr. Kabila's dismissive reaction to the subject in a joint news conference with her. Vowing to arrest other critics, Mr. Kabila sneered, with an uncomfortable Ms. Albright at his side, ""Vive la democratie."" A few weeks later came a turning point in Washington's relations with Mr. Kabila, when President Clinton's special envoy to Africa, Jesse Jackson, visited Kinshasa and was rebuffed by Congolese officials for meeting with opposition politicians. Later, he was denied a scheduled meeting with Mr. Kabila. Within days of Mr. Jackson's departure, the Government arrested Mr. Tshisekedi, the leading opposition figure, and placed him in ""internal exile"" under guard in a village in central Congo. The 66-year-old lawyer was given a Government-issue harvester and seed and told that his ""re-education"" required that he begin to farm. Then came the arrest of several journalists and the banning of the Zairian Association for the Defense of Human Rights, Azadho. According to international human rights groups, Government agents arrested a judge they mistook for the director of Azadho, beat him and held him in detention before realizing their mistake. Government officials deny that any such mistake was made, but say the human rights groups, opposition newspapers and political parties that existed under Mr. Mobutu no longer have a raison d'etre, because under Mr. Kabila and his Alliance of Democratic Forces the country has already been ""liberated."" ""Azadho is like all of those other organizations out there complaining -- they are opponents,"" said Abdoulaye N. Yerodia, Mr. Kabila's cabinet director. ""But we are under no obligation to inherit the opposition to Mobutu."" Since the April announcement of the withdrawal of the United Nations massacre investigation for lack of Government cooperation, the string of missteps by the Government has left even many of its most ardent supporters deeply embarrassed. Just days after the announcement of an International Monetary Fund agreement restoring badly needed financial assistance in return for Kinshasa's resumption of debt service payments, the Government denied that it had agreed to resume its payments. Now I.M.F support has been halted. 'An Awful Lot Of Darkness' Similarly, after months of courting its former colonial power, Mr. Kabila's Government publicly accused Belgium of being a ""terrorist state"" because of a small stockade of arms ""discovered"" at the Belgian consulate in Lubumbashi. Kinshasa was later obliged to acknowledge that the weapons had been brought into the country legally and were properly registered. No sooner has the dust settled from that incident than the Government was attacking the United Nations Children's Fund for collusion with rebels in Congo's still restive eastern border lands, giving further reason to an already aggrieved United Nations to review its cooperation with the country. ""Our policy calls for supporting the Government, but at this point it is pretty much for lack of an alternative,"" a Western diplomat said. ""That means searching around for the few bright spots, because there is an awful lot of darkness out there.""

President Daniel arap Moi suspended the official, John Harun Mwau, on Wednesday, just four days after Mr. Mwau had filed charges against four high-ranking Treasury Department officials, accusing them of a scheme to evade $3.9 million in import duties on wheat and sugar. The President's actions came after the Finance Minister, Simeon Nyachae, in a spirited defense of his accused subordinates, attacked Mr. Mwau in public, accusing him of starting a witch hunt. He defended the officials, who are accused of corrupt business dealings, maintaining that not only did they act within the law, but with the full approval of the Cabinet. Played out on the front pages of newspapers here, the disagreement has undermined the credibility of Mr. Moi's efforts to stamp out corruption, once again putting Kenya's shaky relations with international lenders in jeopardy. ""This is not helpful,"" said one diplomat, insisting on anonymity. ""This is an unfortunate development, distracting from the central issues this country faces. This is all a distraction, a sideshow."" When the International Monetary Fund suspended aid to Kenya last year, one of its principal complaints was that the Government had done little or nothing to rein in rampant official corruption. In recent years, corrupt schemes have seeped into almost every level of government here, from bribes that traffic officers solicit from motorists to elaborate land grabs and import-duty scams involving cabinet members, diplomats say. In response to pressure from the I.M.F., Mr. Moi set up the Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority last December and put Mr. Mwau, a former police officer and an opposition gadfly, in charge. But Mr. Mwau's decision to prosecute the four treasury officials as his first high-profile case has raised questions about his sincerity and the viability of his authority, diplomats and financial officials said. Before the charges were leveled, the four accused officials were seen as part of a progressive, reform-minded wing of the governing party, a group led by Mr. Nyachae that stands firmly behind efforts to stamp out corruption. While diplomats and officials at international lending institutions said they could not say whether the charges were true, they did say they came as a surprise. ""We have a feeling that these people who were to be arrested were doing their jobs and we have no reason to believe they were corrupt,"" one banking official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Whether or not the charges are true, several diplomats said the public contretemps was not likely to persuade the I.M.F. and World Bank to resume aid to shore up Kenya's shattered economy, which is reeling from a steep drop in tourism. On the streets of the capital, meanwhile, speculation has grown that Mr. Mwau purposely took aim at pro-reform officials first, instead of other officials suspected of corruption in order to take the wind out of the pro-reform movement's sails. A cartoon in Wednesday's Daily Nation newspaper showed Mr. Mwau and Mr. Nyachae as puppets, their strings being pulled by hands recognizable as the President's. A statement from the President's office said Mr. Moi would appoint a tribunal to ""inquire into the proper performance"" of the corruption authority. The statement said Mr. Mwau would be suspended until the tribunal had finished its inquiry. For his part, Mr. Mwau has fiercely defended the charges against the four officials and has said he will resign if they are not proved true in court. It is highly unlikely the case will ever be heard, however, since the Attorney General has dropped the charges. The accused officials are Joseph Kinyua, Njeru Kirira, John Msafari and Samuel Chebii. At the same time, Mr. Nyachae has accused Mr. Mwau of pressing the charges only to divert attention from the fact that he himself is under investigation by the Kenya Revenue Authority for evading duty on the import of automobile tires. Mr. Mwau denies any wrongdoing."1-Jan-99,"ANGOLA (94%); NIGERIA (93%); AFRICA (92%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (79%); PORTUGAL (79%);","Civil war has ruined Angola's economy, but the chaos wrought by conflict has been a boon for politicians and generals, providing a smoke screen for rampant corruption and mismanagement in the oil and diamond industries, financial analysts and diplomats say. This southwest African nation could well become Africa's number-one oil producer over the next decade, possibly surpassing Nigeria, the current leader. Diamond deposits along Angola's many rivers and in its ancient volcanic rock, though less lucrative on a large scale than oil, are among the highest quality and most sought gemstones in the world. But as in Nigeria, which has long been one of the continent's most corrupt nations, Angola's vast and largely unaccounted-for wealth moves through a shadow economy. Oil revenue simply disappears and is believed to be taken by government officials, business sources here say. And while it is common knowledge that the UNITA rebel movement has financed itself with the diamonds in its territory, diplomats and analysts say they believe that illicit deals are made by and between rebel leaders and army generals who, when dollars are not on the table, are otherwise at war. While corruption here may not approach the level of the utterly thieving regime of Mobutu Sese Seko, the late dictator of the former Zaire, analysts and diplomats say it has become systemic. Based on anecdotal evidence, the officially enforced dearth of budgetary data and official books that just do not add up, analysts say they believe that the trend toward corruption has been set by a powerful group around President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. The group is called the Futungist faction, for the Futungo presidential compound along the Atlantic coast south of the capital. ""Everybody knows it,"" said a loyalist to dos Santos's ruling party, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). The party loyalist described corruption as the MPLA's ""life-insurance scheme,"" which took hold gradually but soon became commonplace. ""Like a virus, you could not stop it,"" he said. As he described it, independence from Portugal in 1975 turned the MPLA's guerrilla fighters into politicians who had the best of intentions but found themselves mired in bureaucratic responsibilities. With a continuing war against UNITA wearing them down at the same time, they succumbed to the temptation of simply securing their own wealth. An analyst who has attempted to decipher Angola's chaotic economic system said there is little indication in government accounts of how oil and diamond revenue flows in and out of the budget. Controls and accounting procedures for government revenue are virtually nonexistent, reducing the budget to a document of fiction, the analyst said. Half of what the government says it spends cannot be traced to a revenue source, he said, and much of what is believed to be produced in oil revenue is unaccounted for. The analyst said oil produced about $ 1.5 billion in revenue last year, with two-thirds presumed to go toward defense, leaving $ 500 million unaccounted for. ""It is not clear what really happens to this revenue,"" he said. ""There's widespread speculation that a significant chunk of it leaks out."" Leakage also is endemic in the diamond sector. No figures are available on precisely how much diamond revenue has been produced. UNITA rebels have controlled virtually all of Angola's diamond-producing territory in recent years, although the diamond-rich provinces of Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul have changed hands a few times in the past year's fighting. The economic analyst estimates that only 10 percent of diamond revenue reaches government coffers, with most of the rest going to UNITA and, to a lesser extent, to government generals. The traffic in uncertified diamonds has continued despite a U.N. embargo last June against diamond deals with UNITA. Global Witness, a Britain-based human rights group, has criticized the government for poor controls in the diamond industry and has accused international diamond conglomerate De Beers of trafficking in UNITA-mined diamonds, a charge that De Beers denies. The government rarely comments on its economic details. Officials here do, however, acknowledge that the economy is in chaos -- mired in debt and in need of reform. But when voices of criticism are raised from within the ruling party, they are silenced. Lopo do Nascimento, a former prime minister, was removed as party secretary general at a party congress last month when a reform movement loosely coalesced around him tried to open debate on the need for economic reforms, sources knowledgeable about party affairs say. Rather than entertain a reform agenda, dos Santos quashed debate on the issue and hammered at the need for unity in the face of the MPLA's chief nemesis and convenient bogey man, rebel leader Jonas Savimbi. Savimbi's UNITA -- the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola -- has been fighting the MPLA off and on since well before independence. Most government attention has been focused on checking UNITA's strength, as in the current round of fighting, which began last month with a government attempt to take UNITA's stronghold. More than two decades on a war footing has warped the economy. While defense spending is the focus of the budget, schools and clinics are not built, factories are not rehabilitated, roads -- except for a few in the capital -- are not repaired, and towns in the interior that have been destroyed by fighting stand as exhibits of the Angolan nightmare. Most of Angola's 12 million people live in utter rural poverty made all the worse by the land mines sown in the soil and the bandits who work the roads. It is notable, though mysterious, analysts say, that a private foundation established in 1997 by the president, the Fundacao Eduardo dos Santos, has been building schools with funds from an unknown source. Murky budgetary practices are one of the reasons that Angola cannot get loans from the International Monetary Fund, which has conditioned credit on more transparency and control in government accounts. Angola's external debt is about $ 10.5 billion, and the service on that debt accounts, on paper, for 20 percent of gross national product, one of the highest such percentages in the world, according to the World Bank. Angola is in such a deep financial mess that the government routinely rolls over its debt by seeking oil-guaranteed short-term loans that, in effect, mortgage future oil revenue, the financial analyst here said. The government also has no money to pay for imports, and cannot pay public servants and government contractors. But oil keeps flowing, with a host of international oil firms pumping out in the Atlantic Ocean or bidding here in the capital, Luanda, for the deep-water oil fields that industry analysts say will catapult Angola into the oil-production big leagues. Current production of 750,000 barrels per day is expected to double over the next decade. And the cost of doing oil business here also is going up, including hundreds of millions of dollars in ""signing fees"" that the government demands for oil exploration rights. Seven percent of U.S. oil imports come from Angola, and that amount is expected to double along with production. American companies, such as Chevron, are major players in the industry."20-Feb-99,KENYA (98%); TURKEY (79%);,"A day after his corruption-fighting predecessor quit in a major Cabinet shake-up, the new Finance Minister sought today to reassure investors and donors of foreign aid that he would continue on the path of fiscal reform. The statements from the new Minister, Yekoyada F. O. Masakhalia, seemed primarily aimed at the International Monetary Fund. Officials from the fund are to visit Kenya this month to decide whether to reinstate an important $205 million package of financial aid that was frozen in 1997 largely because of corruption and mismanagement of public money. Many experts here said they believed that the package would be restored as a result of improved fiscal policies put into effect by the departing Finance Minister, Simeon Nyachae. Today, Mr. Masakhalia, 61, an economist with a master's from Harvard University, said he would seek few substantive changes. ""I would like to emphasize there will be no change to the ongoing policy thrust,"" he said at a news conference here. Mr. Nyachae resigned on Thursday in a surprise move. He is a leading politician, often mentioned as a potential successor to President Daniel arap Moi who, since he was appointed in January 1998, had cut Government spending and brought down interest rates. He also waged a highly public battle against corruption, even reporting the names of prominent Kenyans who had not repaid national bank loans. He said on Thursday that his resignation had ""irked many people"" and made his job as Finance Minister ""even more difficult."" He quit his post rather than accept Mr. Moi's decision for him to swap jobs with Mr. Masakhalia, who had been Industrial Development Minister. Mr. Moi shifted six other ministers and dismissed a few others, notably Immigration Minister Frank Kwinga, whose department controls arrivals like that of a Kurdish leader, Abdullah Ocalan. Mr. Ocalan was smuggled into Kenya on Feb. 2 and captured by Turkey this week. http://www.nytimes.com"30-Mar-99,NIGERIA (95%); UNITED STATES (94%); FRANCE (79%); EUROPE (79%); AFRICA (79%); GERMANY (79%);,"The President-elect of Nigeria came to New York yesterday to say that his country, an international pariah for 16 years, is now headed firmly toward democratic rule, privatization of its huge oil industry and an end to decades of official corruption and severe human rights abuse. Olusegun Obasanjo, 61, whose election on Feb. 27 was welcomed by the West, appeared frank and direct as he spoke about the unsavory reputation Nigeria had acquired. But he declined to offer specifics on what he vowed would be sweeping reforms. ""I'm sure you are used to bad news from Nigeria,"" he said, adding that his country had been ""among the leading corrupt nations of the world."" He said: ""There is virtually no sector of our society that has not been wounded. We have to bind the wounds and bring conciliation and unity, give people hope and a sense of belonging and participation."" Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation, with 108 million inhabitants. Under Gen. Sani Abacha it suffered five years of ruthless dictatorship, which ended last June when he died unexpectedly. His successor, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, began reforms, allowing elections that ended in victory for Mr. Obasanjo, a retired general and former President. He is to be inaugurated on May 29. Mr. Obasanjo exuded charisma and self-confidence at a news conference yesterday, with his powerful frame cloaked in a majestic blue robe. He said his trip here, part of a world tour, was aimed at reassuring political and business leaders of his sincerity, skill and determination. He is expected in Washington today to meet with top American officials, including Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and, tentatively, President Clinton, as well as leaders of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. He arrived here from Europe, where he had offered his message of hope to the leaders and investors of France, Germany and Britain, among others. Large advertising spreads in international newsmagazines and on CNN in recent weeks have also sought to drive home the point that Nigeria, one of the world's largest exporters of oil, has embarked on a new course. Mr. Obasanjo was asked yesterday whether he would follow the South African model of healing society's wounds with the equivalent of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate the misdeeds of his predecessors and their aides. He declined to commit himself. ""When I am on the saddle, then I'll make definitive pronouncements,"" he said. He added that he did not now have the information he needed. He was slightly more forthcoming in an interview with a syndicated columnist, Jonathan Power, that appeared in the Los Angeles Times on Sunday. On corruption, he said, ""You must show that the practices you want to get rid of are punished,"" and added: ""I will more than crack the whip. I will use the whip."" Mr. Obasanjo, a Yoruba from southern Nigeria, is said to have close links to northern military leaders and was viewed during the election campaign as a bridge between the two regions. He is the only Nigerian ruler ever to have stepped down voluntarily, which he did in 1979. At the time, he set the stage for a democratic system, which was overthrown a few years later. http://www.nytimes.com"29-May-99,NIGERIA (99%); AFRICA (94%); UNITED STATES (79%);,"When Nigeria's first civilian government in 15 years takes office Saturday, its most pressing task will be to grapple with the economic and political crises seizing Africa's most populous nation. But intellectuals and foreign analysts worry about how empty the new government will find its bank accounts following a spending spree by the departing military rulers. The outgoing administration of Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar has won global applause for leading Nigeria back to elected government a year after taking power upon the death of a corrupt dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha. Yet Abubakar's military government has drained the country's foreign currency reserves by perhaps $ 3 billion in what business sources and the Nigerian press say was a burst of corrupt spending for the profit of senior officers and their business partners. The government says it has spent the money on essential projects or to fill the financial gap caused by low oil revenues. In any case, the spending deepens the financial hole from which the new government of President-elect Olusegun Obasanjo will have to dig itself. It also raises stakes for the United States and other Western nations that are negotiating, through the International Monetary Fund, the terms on which they will lend Obasanjo's government money to help stabilize the country. U.S. and African leaders stress that Nigeria's continued transition toward democracy is essential to improving stability and economic development throughout much of Africa. In January, Abubakar announced a painfully tight budget, noting low world prices for crude oil, sales of which supply about 80 percent of Nigeria's government revenue. All officials, he said, ""must ensure that expenditures are incurred for only essential purposes."" Abubakar's government signed an agreement with the IMF to limit spending as a first step to getting IMF loans. But Abubakar either proved unable to control the demands of military officers for financial favors or backed away from insisting on tight spending and accountability, Western diplomats and Nigerian analysts said. In March, Nigeria's state-owned oil company -- which was controlled by the military's ruling council -- allocated 11 oil exploration licenses without seeking competitive bids that would have brought the state a fair market price. The 11 licenses, for geologically attractive areas near existing oil fields, went to Nigerian companies linked to senior military officers or former Abacha business associates, according to government and oil industry sources quoted by Nigerian journalists and a London-based newsletter, Africa Confidential. One firm, Amni International, is run by Sani Bello, whose son is married to Abubakar's daughter, the newsletter reported. Others linked to the winning bids included the government's second-ranking officer, Adm. Mike Akhigbe; the chief of defense staff, Air Marshal Alamin Daggash; the chief of army staff, Gen. Ishaya Bamaiyi; former Abacha business partners Jack and Gilbert Chagoury; and Abacha's ex-oil minister, Dan Etete. Officials denied parts of the reported deals. Last week, Information Minister John Nwodo declared that ""Air Marshal Daggash disassociates himself"" from Anchorage Petroleum, the company to which he had been linked in press reports. To buttress the denial, Nwodo declared that the company was not even registered with the appropriate authorities, leaving it unclear how it won the license in the first place. Nwodo also said Akhigbe and Bamaiyi had issued denials. Government ministries also have pressed for allocations beyond the budget -- often for construction or other services by companies linked to influential military officers or their business. Last month, Finance Minister Ismaila Usman told donor countries that Nigeria's foreign reserves had dropped from $ 6.7 billion to $ 4 billion during the first quarter of 1999. And government officials leaked details of the spending to the Nigerian and British press. One leaked document was a list of about 50 projects -- costing more than $ 600 million overall -- approved in a ministerial meeting April 22. From that list, the weekly Newswatch noted an allocation of about $ 73 million to continue construction of a government-owned aluminum smelter -- regarded as a white elephant by foreign economists -- whose agreed price had suddenly doubled without explanation several years ago under Abacha. The April 22 list included almost $ 50 million to finish hundreds of official homes in Abuja for government ministers, civil servants and legislators, plus $ 33 million to finish a terminal at Abuja's airport. ""It's uncertain how much of the money"" appropriated April 22 has actually been spent, said a business analyst in Lagos, Nigeria's financial center. ""We may not find that out until Obasanjo's people get in and actually see the books."" Abubakar protested suggestions that his administration has been broadly corrupt. ""It is very much unfair for somebody to . . . accuse this administration of looting the treasury,"" he said. ""Everything we have done is there for anybody to see. . . . Anybody can go into the records . . . and see where we have spent the money."""27-Oct-99,SIERRA LEONE,"Two things caught my attention about U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit to Sierra Leone [news story, Oct. 19]. First, Secretary Albright pledged $ 55 million in aid to this impoverished nation, and second, she challenged President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah's administration to embark on an International Monetary Fund (IMF) program to qualify the country for a waiver on its $ 65 million debt (subject to congressional approval). Many have criticized the United States for not doing enough to save this war-ravaged country from self-inflicted ruin. Critics have failed, however, to observe that Sierra Leone's eight-year war was not a rebellion targeted entirely at the political establishment but a war fought by bandits to gain control of mineral resources. Militia leaders Foday Sankoh, the new vice president, and his comrade, Johnny Paul Koroma led a campaign that brought carnage to the nation, destroyed its historical infrastructure, killed and maimed its citizens and halted democracy. Aid money must not be given directly to politicians. Aid should come in the form of technical assistance with direct involvement of agencies to oversee food and medicine distribution and infrastructure development. Only this strategy will prevent a repetition of the greed and corruption that have brought Sierra Leone to its present state. Silver Spring  While U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with President Kabbah and rebel leaders in Sierra Leone, lending support to the reconciliation process [news story, Oct. 18], reports are of infighting and another abduction (of the bishop of Makeni and several aid workers and priests) by disgruntled rebel troops. The peace accord is an international capitulation to thugs and warlords at the expense of a democratically elected regime. However, the country is exhausted, the leaders of the parties to the conflict seem ready to collaborate and this accord is all there is. But for even this poor compromise to have a chance, peacekeeping must be funded. Currently, peacekeeping is being shouldered by the ill-equipped and financially strapped West African force for which U.S. support has been inadequate at best. The U.N. Security Council has yet to approve a proposed 6,000-strong peacekeeping force. The United Nations -- crippled by a $ 1.7 billion arrears in U.S. payments -- is stretched thin in Kosovo and East Timor. Stabilization also demands humanitarian relief for the displaced and mutilated civilian victims of the war. The Post reports, however, that the U.N. World Food Program, for lack of contributions, has cut emergency aid to Sierra Leone's refugees [World in Brief, Oct. 17]. Pressure must be brought to bear on our representatives to stop their obstruction of American foreign policy, to pay U.N. dues and to support humanitarian and peacekeeping programs for Sierra Leone. Washington"8-Nov-99,"GABON (94%); NIGERIA (92%); UNITED STATES (92%); PAKISTAN (92%); VENEZUELA, BOLIVARIAN REPUBLIC OF (79%); AFRICA (73%);","In 1997, federal bank examiners were pressing executives at Citibank Private Bank to explain the source of more than $50 million deposited into a secret account controlled by the president of Gabon, Omar Bongo, bank and Senate documents show. Existing Citibank profiles said President Bongo's wealth was created as ""a result of his position"" and ""donations"" from a French oil company doing business in the African nation, according to the documents. But a draft report by Democratic Senate investigators found that in responding to regulators, Citibank produced a new profile showing other sources of the wealth -- information the report says is inaccurate and unverified. This week, Citibank's handling of private accounts like Mr. Bongo's will be the subject of Senate hearings. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is examining the vulnerability of private banking to money laundering. In recent years, billions of dollars have left fragile economies, from Russia to Mexico, facilitated by Western bankers. The Senate hearings, whose witnesses will include Citibank executives and federal regulators, will offer the first detailed public look at one of the most secretive parts of the global financial system, private banking, in which wealthy customers are afforded extra discretion and care. The hearings come at a time when previously acceptable practices in private banking are undergoing new scrutiny. President Bongo's account is one of several the Senate is investigating that are tied to prominent foreign political leaders or their families, in Mexico, Venezuela, Nigeria and Pakistan as well as Gabon. Citibank's private banking clients included such controversial figures as the sons of Gen. Sani Abacha, the Nigerian dictator; Raul Salinas de Gortari, the brother of Mexico's former president, and Asif Ali Zadari, the husband of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan. In 1997, federal examiners were looking at whether Mr. Bongo's transactions should be reported as suspicious. American law bans banks from moving money earned abroad from some crimes, like drug trafficking, but not corruption. A central tenet of banking is to know your customer, and banks are required to report certain suspicious transactions to regulators. Yet, the committee's staff report notes, ""there is currently no statutory, regulatory or industry guidance of what is adequate due diligence."" So in 1997 the regulators felt reassured after Citibank officials told them that Mr. Bongo's transactions ""are normal for the head of state of an African country,"" according to portions of the examiners' report quoted by Senate investigators. Mr. Bongo's profile had been revised in 1997 to say his wealth stemmed primarily from government budgeted accounts and personal oil investments in Gabon and other African countries. Senate investigators, however, found the explanations unverified and, in the first case, ""implausible and plainly contrary to Gabon's budget policy and actual spending,"" the draft report says. Citibank documents show that bank officials were aware of news reports that Mr. Bongo was under investigation for possibly accepting bribes from French oil executives, but they were reluctant to raise those reports with Mr. Bongo or regulators, according to the draft report. Mr. Bongo has not been charged with any wrongdoing. A spokesman for the Gabon Embassy in Washington declined to comment. A Citibank spokesman said bank officials believed that President Bongo's wealth came from legitimate sources and that he had been ""considered a distinguished head of government, supported and embraced by U.S. presidents."" Meanwhile, Citibank has moved to close Mr. Bongo's account, one of 40,000 at Citibank Private Bank. Citibank estimates that only 350 of the private bank's customers are public officials or their families. The closing of Mr. Bongo's account follows moves by the bank's senior management to tighten supervision of sensitive accounts and to keep the bank from being used for improper purposes. John Reed, the chairman and co-chief executive of Citigroup, the parent of Citibank, is expected to tell the Senate committee about Citibank's new measures against money laundering and a policy adopted last year to shy away from seeking out public figures as private bank clients, according to people familiar with his prepared testimony. He is also expected to discuss how regulators now find significant improvements in the private bank's internal controls. The Citibank documents make clear the potential pitfalls for one of the world's most powerful and prestigious financial institutions. The Senate inquiry is such a sensitive matter for Citigroup that it hired two former senior White House lawyers, C. Boyden Gray of the Bush administration and Jane Sherburne of the Clinton administration, to help the bank prepare and respond. One Senate investigator said Citibank had once lobbied to have a 1992 check for $1 million from Libya to a Bongo account offshore unfrozen by the United States government, contending that Citibank could lose its business in Gabon if the payment remained frozen by anti-terrorism statutes. Mark Musi, the chief compliance officer for Citibank Private Bank, said, ""The Private Bank never has had a strategy to link efforts to get or retain a head of state's personal business in order to develop other business in that country."" He added that Citibank's business in Gabon is ""extremely small"" and unaffected by the decision to close the Bongo account. But Raymond Baker, a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution who is scheduled to testify at the hearings, worries that when Western banks help the powerful elite in less developed countries to hide their wealth -- some of which may be ill gotten -- they undercut the efforts by Western governments and entities like the International Monetary Fund to help the economies of those poorer countries. ""It is Western taxpayers who are paying it out over the table to these countries and the private banks who take it back under the table,"" Mr. Baker said in an interview. He is concerned that Western banks that move corrupt money out of poorer countries may aid the client in committing crimes like tax evasion, illegal capital flight and false trade invoicing, all of which fall outside the reach of American money laundering statutes. But this movement of money, Mr. Baker added, sucks $100 billion per year out of poorer countries. In many ways, the interest in Citibank Private Bank stems from its involvement with Mr. Salinas. Mr. Reed is expected to tell the Senate panel that the bank has learned a lot from the now well-known Salinas affair, even though it has never been cited for any legal or regulatory violations. Between 1992 and 1994 the bank moved between $80 million and $100 million through Mr. Salinas's accounts, using extra confidential methods that the General Accounting Office, the audit arm of Congress, later found ""disguised"" the ""origin, destination and beneficial owner of the funds."" Mr. Reed is to tell the committee that while Citibank failed then to follow its own policy, it now has much tougher rules. The Senate panel turned up some new details in the Salinas case, including transcripts of phone calls between Citibank officials. After Mr. Salinas's arrest in 1995 on murder charges -- he was later convicted of participating in the murder of his former brother-in-law -- the initial reaction of Citibank was to see whether his money could be shifted to Switzerland to make it more difficult for law enforcement officials to discover his assets, according to Senate aides. That idea was rejected, the aides said, when it was discovered that bank records in London and the United States, which could not be destroyed, would point to the Swiss accounts. The committee has also examined the case of Mr. Zadari, a former senator in Pakistan. Mr. Zadari, currently in jail on corruption charges, had about $40 million in Citibank Private Bank in Geneva. The bank has not been accused of wrongdoing, but internal Citibank audits as well as audits by federal bank examiners continually criticized managerial deficiencies in Citibank Private Bank in Switzerland, Senate documents show. Those audits and the investigation of the Salinas money led Mr. Reed to write to Citibank's board of directors in November 1997. ""We live in a world where we have to worry about 'how someone made his/her money,' which did not used to be an issue,"" he said, according to portions of the letter excerpted in the Democratic draft report. ""Much that we had done to keep Private Banking private becomes 'wrong' in the current environment."" Another case study in the Senate inquiry involves the accounts of two of General Abacha's sons -- one of whom, Muhammad, has just been charged in Nigeria with the murder of the wife of his father's leading opponent. The New York private banker for the Nigerian account -- the same person who handled Mr. Bongo's account -- told staff investigators that for three years he thought his clients were Nigerian businessmen rather than the sons of Nigeria's military leader, the staff report says. When General Abacha died unexpectedly in June 1998, the Nigerian government began looking into his family's wealth and billions of dollars of missing money. With the corruption inquiry under way, Citibank got a request from one of the general's sons, saying he urgently needed $39 million from the London account, records show. But the money was in a time deposit that could not be redeemed for a while without a financial penalty, the staff report says. Citibank had long accommodated the Abacha family by setting up accounts with secret names like Gelsobella and Chinquinto. So the private bank found a way to immediately transfer the $39 million and avoid the penalty, documents show. Citibank records one month later say the transfer was meant to be the first step in the closing of the account by the client. But last March, before the account could be closed, a London court issued an order in a civil suit freezing all accounts related to General Abacha. Citigroup's lawyers have argued that the Senate committee is on shaky jurisdictional grounds because American money laundering statutes cover only proceeds of activities in foreign countries that fall under three categories of offenses: certain drug crimes, certain violent crimes, and fraud by or against a foreign bank, according to a letter last month to the committee from Mr. Gray. The letter goes on to say that the Democratic staff believes that money in the accounts of Mr. Bongo, General Abacha's sons and Jaime Lusinchi, a former president of Venezuela, may have been ""derived from corruption or other improper acts against a foreign government."" Even if true, Mr. Gray says in the letter, those offenses do not constitute crimes in the United States and thus fall outside the committee's jurisdiction. http://www.nytimes.com"24-Dec-99,COTE D'IVOIRE (97%); EUROPE (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (68%);,"Soldiers rampaged in the streets of Abidjan today, shooting wildly into the air, stealing cars and looting stores, apparently in a protest over unpaid wages. Residents dashed for cover as soldiers zoomed through Abidjan in stolen luxury sedans and four-wheel-drive vehicles, firing automatic weapons and shouting obscenities. Stores closed throughout the city, Ivory Coast's commercial capital, and barricades went up in some neighborhoods. More soldiers drove up and down the road leading east from Abidjan to Bingerville, a nearby town. Abandoned cars littered the deserted road, which is normally crowded with people and vehicles. Witnesses said the soldiers forced people from their cars and took off with the vehicles. ""I am scared for my life and for my car,"" said a taxi driver, Koudjo Yao. ""If I lose my car, I lose everything."" Daniel Kadja, an official in the Ministry of Presidential Affairs, played down the rebellion, saying there was ""no need to panic."" The violence eased somewhat late tonight. A presidential official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said negotiations were under way with leaders of the uprising. The soldiers did not announce a reason for the protest, but individuals among them complained about unpaid salaries, poor living conditions and insufficient benefits like housing subsidies. Ivory Coast, a country of 19 million people, has long been considered a model of West African stability. But political and social turmoil have risen steadily as the country prepares for presidential elections, scheduled for next October. Earlier today, gunfire resounded near the national television and radio stations, which went off the air without explanation during the afternoon. Soldiers, some in uniform and others in T-shirts and caps, surrounded both broadcast centers. The gates of both were locked. United Nations staff members were trapped in their downtown offices across the street from the radio station, which appeared to be under attack, a United Nations spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said in New York. The gates to the American Embassy nearby were also locked. But the streets around the president's residence in suburban Cocody remained calm. The airport, on the southeastern edge of the city, continued to function normally. The rampage subsided as night approached, but sporadic gunfire continued and soldiers blocked off the main roads leaving the city. At least one tank was seen, and the thud of explosions could be heard in the distance. The State Department urged Americans in Abidjan to remain in their homes. The country has been plagued by mounting foreign debt and an economic downturn linked to the falling prices of its main exports, coffee and cocoa. Government coffers were depleted further this year when the European Union and the International Monetary Fund suspended aid because of corruption allegations. An opposition leader, Alassane Dramane Ouattara, accuses the government of harassing his political party. Last month, 12 leaders of his party, Rally of the Republicans, were jailed and a warrant has been issued for Mr. Ouattara's arrest. President Henri Konan Bedie says Mr. Ouattara is not eligible to run for president because his father was born in Burkina Faso. Mr. Ouattara denies the claim and says he has documents to prove his father's citizenship. Mr. Bedie, who has banned all outdoor demonstrations, went on national television on Wednesday to appeal for unity and calm. Looking nervous, he promised ""reconciliation, peace, happiness and prosperity"" if the opposition cooperated with the government.  http://www.nytimes.com Map of the Ivory Coast highlighting Abidjan: Troops in Abidjan fired weapons in the air and hijacked cars."25-Dec-99,COTE D'IVOIRE (96%); AFRICA (95%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%); FRANCE (90%); KENYA (79%); UNITED STATES (79%);,"Army troops in the West African country of Ivory Coast seized control of the capital, Abidjan, today and proclaimed a military government, an uprising unprecedented in a country long considered one of Africa's most stable. Soldiers began seizing government installations Thursday in what they said was a mutiny by an Abidjan-based unit over unpaid wages. Today, the former army chief of staff, Gen. Robert Guei, announced on state television that President Henri Konan Bedie was no longer in power. But Bedie said later in a radio interview that he retained power and was meeting with mutinous troops. Bedie appealed for popular resistance to the coup, but poor people in Abidjan's vast slums cheered his reported overthrow, said residents. Bedie's Democratic Party of Ivory Coast--the only party that has ruled there in nearly 40 years of independence--has lost support in the past decade over official corruption and rising demands for real democracy. Still, as some senior military officers and foreign diplomats reportedly implored Guei to halt the coup, independent observers found reason to hope that the crisis might be resolved peacefully. Ivory Coast--known officially by its French name, Cote d'Ivoire--has a large, educated middle class and civil society unlikely to support military rule. The strongest reason for optimism lay in how strongly the flavor of events once so common to transfers of power in Africa--dueling broadcasts, mutinous soldiers firing automatic weapons into the air and a man in uniform declaring the constitution null and void--now seemed out of place. Since the end of the Cold War, coups have become less frequent in Africa and, indeed, have never occurred in Ivory Coast. Self-appointed rulers who once could count on the United States or the Soviet Union to prop them up must answer to an array of Western donors, starting with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. And their primary condition for foreign aid is at least the appearance of democracy. ""That's the new atmosphere,"" said Herman J. Cohen, a former assistant secretary of state for Africa. ""This general on the television doesn't seem to realize that."" Ivory Coast, long ruled by the French troops and bureaucrats who created it, has remained one of France's most loyal former colonies in Africa. Its founder, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, ruled the country tightly for 33 years, permitting opposing political parties only when he could no longer prevent them without heavy bloodshed. Bedie, a bland machine politician in the ruling party, took power when Houphouet-Boigny died in 1993. Bedie won a disputed election and rode out protests and riots in 1995 after disqualifying his chief opponent. Soon after, Bedie dismissed Guei as army chief; officials alleged that Guei had been plotting a coup. On Thursday, soldiers drove into the state television station and fired into the air when some employees resisted orders to leave. Some of the employees fled to the U.S. Embassy's cultural center around the corner, and told Washington Post researcher Solomon Ababio that the troops were demanding back pay for their unit's service in a U.N. peacekeeping mission in the Central African Republic. In numerous parts of Abidjan, soldiers looted shops and were joined by impoverished civilians, residents said. No deaths were reported. Guei appeared on state television today, saying he had taken power at the troops' request. ""From this instant, President Henri Konan Bedie is no longer the president of the republic,"" he said, and proclaimed the dissolution of parliament and other government institutions. A Military Committee of Public Salvation announced a dusk-to-dawn curfew and called on soldiers to cease looting. From a hiding place in the city's diplomatic neighborhood, Bedie responded in an interview on Radio France Internationale. He called on Ivorians to ""resist and oppose this grotesque and retrograde military coup by all means possible,"" and vowed to remain at his post. He pledged to resolve the pay demands of the soldiers through ""dialogue."" An American reached by telephone in Abidjan described the mutineering soldiers as raucous, but said residents were calm. ""There are [soldiers] roaring through the streets looking pretty ugly, with cars that have obviously been stolen,"" the resident said. ""All the danger is potential danger, but the potential danger is there."" The Christmas Eve crisis followed months of mounting opposition to Bedie. Like virtually all black African states created as European-ruled colonies, Ivory Coast is an artificial mix of ethnic groups. While Houphouet-Boigny ran an authoritarian government, he assiduously dampened ethnic tensions, partly by distributing wealth from the cocoa farms that are the pillar of the economy. But cocoa prices have fallen and the economy has struggled to keep up with a flood of immigration from Burkina Faso, Mali, Liberia, Ghana and other neighbors. In 1995, Bedie--an ethnic Baoule from the country's center--alienated many Muslim northerners by disqualifying northerner Alassane Ouattara from the presidential race, and tensions over that issue have revived as Bedie faces reelection next fall. ""For a place where things are good, things are bad at the moment in Ivory Coast,"" said I. William Zartman, director of African Studies at the Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies. He said the coup could yet be reversed or result in a more even-handed election than Bedie was prepared to allow.

Since the largely nonviolent coup, Gen. Robert Guei has been meeting with people from various sectors of society to outline his vision for the future. General Guei met with political party leaders on Monday and invited them to submit candidates for a transitional cabinet that he said could be announced next week. General Guei, who earlier had promised an ""orderly"" return to democracy, said today that he would improve on the record of the ousted president, Henri Konan Bedie, whose government was accused of rampant corruption that led the International Monetary Fund and European Union to cut aid this year. General Guei has not said, however, whether presidential elections scheduled for October would go ahead. An American Embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, cautiously praised General Guei for ""making the right noises."" But the official said the United States would continue to push for a return to constitutional rule and democracy. General Guei told diplomats that the coup had not been planned. He said he had merely responded to a spontaneous army uprising for better conditions and improved governance. ""I had to make a choice to guarantee peace,"" General Guei said, and assure ""security to all Ivoirian men and women."" He also accused Mr. Bedie of deliberately fomenting political and ethnic divisions, including hiring private security companies to terrorize civilians. His claims could not immediately be verified. The Canadian ambassador, Don McMaster, however, condemned the overthrow. Canada has suspended all direct aid to Ivory Coast. Ambassador McMaster said: ""Guei's response was: 'This wasn't a coup d'etat.' But whatever term you want to use, this is something we have to condemn."" The military uprising began last Thursday with troops racing through the commercial capital, Abidjan, in seized luxury cars and shooting in the air. On Friday, General Guei declared that the military was in control and suspended the Constitution, courts and Parliament. He then appointed nine officers to a National Committee of Public Salvation that will oversee the country, with himself as president of the committee. Many Ivoirians welcomed the coup, saying they hoped that the army would improve Ivory Coast's declining economic and political conditions. Ivory Coast, a nation of 19 million people, had long been considered a model of stability in volatile West Africa. The military takeover was the country's first since it became independent from France in 1960. Political and social tensions have increased in recent months. President Bedie was widely criticized for banning outdoor political demonstrations and jailing opposition politicians. On Sunday, Mr. Bedie fled with family members to Lome, the capital of nearby Togo. The ousted president made a brief trip on Monday to Abuja, Nigeria, where he promised not to oppose the coup with violence and said he planned to spend his ""forced asylum"" trying to rally support for his government.  http://www.nytimes.com"6-Jan-00,COTE D'IVOIRE (97%); EUROPE (94%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (90%); CANADA (79%); FRANCE (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%); AFRICA (79%); NORTH AMERICA (79%);,"Accusing the ousted government of plundering state coffers, Ivory Coast's first military ruler, Gen. Robert Guei, said today that he was suspending the country's staggering foreign-debt payments. General Guei's announcement apparently reversed his pledge last week to honor international commitments inherited from the elected government that he ousted in a coup on Christmas Eve. ""We have temporarily suspended payments of foreign commitments,"" General Guei said in a statement, explaining that coffers were empty. ""Only after a thousand gymnastic moves were we even able to pay salaries."" ""As you can imagine, the pillage was immense and systematic,"" General Guei said in the statement. He said his administration had begun auditing state accounts to learn who is responsible for missing funds. He did not say whether Ivory Coast intended to resume debt payments later on to the World Bank, European Union, International Monetary Fund and other lenders. On Tuesday, General Guei named himself president and defense minister in an interim coalition government. The new cabinet was sworn in today. Ivory Coast, long one of Africa's most stable and prosperous countries, built up a huge debt -- estimated at $19.7 billion in 1996 -- during nearly four decades under the party of the ousted president, Henri Konan Bedie. The junta's move to halt debt payments threatens to aggravate the financial crisis. Last year, the monetary fund and the European Union slashed aid to the country after corruption allegations against the Bedie government. Since the coup, the United States and Canada have also cut aid to the West African country. France, the former colonial ruler, is scaling back its support. And the European Union's representative, Catherine Travin, said today that European officials were scheduled to hold talks with the junta that could lead to further aid cuts. The coup came during an economic decline linked to falling prices for Ivory Coast's main exports, coffee and cocoa. Tensions increased sharply during the final months of Mr. Bedie's government, which was widely accused of corruption and stirring ethnic enmities.  http://www.nytimes.com"7-Jan-00,COTE D'IVOIRE (95%); FRANCE (93%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%); AFRICA (79%);,"In midswing, the construction hammers have fallen silent in this small town surrounded by the West African forest. The luminous Moroccan tiles have been set against the new mosque's walls, but concrete blocks bar the entrance to the unfinished staircase up the minaret. Across town, an inch of stagnant water sits at the bottom of the fountain in the shiny new multimillion-dollar conference hall, the residue of workers' testing the new plumbing. Will jets of water ever spurt joyfully from this fountain to splash against the green marble imported from Italy? Will the muezzin ever ascend the minaret to rouse the faithful to prayer? Those are the questions being asked these days in Daoukro, hometown of Henri Konan Bedie, recently ousted president of Ivory Coast, now in exile in Paris. Military coup leaders took power two weeks ago, in the country's first violent change of government since it won independence from France in 1960. They have accused Mr. Bedie of plundering the nation's wealth. The coup gained widespread support across the country, with the notable exception of Daoukro, its big loser. Since becoming president in 1993, Mr. Bedie, like his predecessor, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, had indulged in the longtime African tradition of spending lavish amounts of public money on his hometown. Despite its remoteness and population of only 14,000, Daoukro suddenly found itself with the best roads in the country and hugely expensive public works projects like a new hotel and a nightclub. Most of it remains a work in progress that, given the Christmas Eve coup, may no longer progress. Ivoirians grumbled about Mr. Houphouet-Boigny's excesses. But he was an autocrat with no political opposition. Above all, he was tolerated because he managed to turn Ivory Coast into the world's leading cocoa producer, the region's most stable country and French-speaking Africa's richest. He opened borders to poor immigrants from neighboring countries and deftly used ethnic politics to create harmony among the country's 60 ethnic groups. By contrast, Mr. Bedie proved a clumsy politician who presided over an increasingly corrupt government. He manipulated the 1995 elections, changing the laws to exclude his main rival, Alassane D. Ouattara, a prime minister under Mr. Houphouet-Boigny and until last year a deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund. Most significantly, in the last year his party embarked on the xenophobic pursuit of so-called ivoirite, drawing distinctions between who was a pure Ivoirian and who was not. Clearly, Mr. Bedie's own ethnic group, the Baoule -- Mr. Houphouet-Boigny was also a Baoule -- were to be considered real Ivoirians, in contrast to the Muslim northerners who make up Mr. Ouattara's base. The xenophobic policies, coupled with the country's economic decline, worsened ethnic tensions. That was one of the reasons cited by the new military ruler, Gen. Robert Guei, a member of the Yacouba minority from the southwest, for staging the coup that made Daoukro a town of long faces. ""You see those trucks there?"" asked the assistant manager of a Shell gas station in the town center, pointing at two flatbeds parked across the street. ""They've been idle there since the coup. They used to carry sand and gravel for all the construction. If they stay parked, that means no business for us."" People have stopped coming here to pay homage to Mr. Bedie's family. At Le Zenith restaurant, as at others, business is slack. ""Now the people who come don't even tip,"" said a waitress who gave her name only as Monique, making a face. ""Nothing's working now. If nothing works here, we'll have to go somewhere else. Everything worked before."" After Mr. Bedie became the country's second president since independence, and workers began breaking ground on several projects, the locals saw Daoukro grow into a town with few rural rivals. Some had even dared to dream that Daoukro would become another Yamoussoukro, a town of 15,000 that, as the birthplace of Mr. Houphouet-Boigny, was turned into the country's capital. ""That was my wish,"" said Zacharia Sankara, 21, somewhat wistfully, as he peered through the wrought-iron gates surrounding the unfinished mosque that Mr. Bedie, a Christian, had offered as a gift to Mr. Sankara and his fellow Muslims. ""But now it's not even sure that all the projects here will be finished. I am even asking myself whether this mosque will be finished -- or will it stay like this?"" Yamoussoukro, a capital yet in the making, perhaps already in the unmaking, stands about 90 miles west of here. Mr. Houphouet-Boigny was a couple of decades into his presidency when he chose to elevate his hometown at the expense of Abidjan, which is by far the country's largest city and considered the most modern in West Africa. By 1983, the equivalent of moving Washington to Hope, Ark., had been done. And eventually what had been forest, cocoa and coconut plantations had a six-lane boulevard, luxury hotels, and a presidential palace surrounded by artificial lagoons alive with crocodiles. Most impressive, though, was the Roman Catholic basilica that Mr. Houphouet-Boigny had built, at an estimated cost of more than $300 million. The Notre Dame de la Paix basilica became the world's largest church -- even bigger than St. Peter's in Rome -- with handblown French stained glass in 4,000 different tints and tons of marble shipped from Italy to cover a 7.4-acre esplanade. The basilica's 7,000 seats each have individual air-conditioning ducts. But a decade after Pope John Paul II reluctantly sanctified the structure, cracks have appeared in the marble esplanade, and trees and shrubbery are growing unchecked. Only a couple of hundred faithful regularly attend Sunday Mass, and even on the major Christian holidays the basilica is only half full. (Christmas Mass was canceled last month because of the coup.) Yamoussoukro has generally been declining since Mr. Houphouet-Boigny's death in 1993. Embassies never moved there from Abidjan; neither did the government's own ministries. The luxury hotels and wide boulevards grew emptier still as political pilgrims dropped Yamoussoukro in favor of Mr. Bedie's hometown. Where they will go next is anyone's guess. General Guei, the coup leader, has promised elections but given no date yet. A transitional government has been named, comprising mostly military officials, technocrats and members of Mr. Ouattara's party, the Rally of Republicans. Laurent Gbagbo, leader of another opposition party, pulled out of the transitional government at the last minute, describing it as heavily tilted toward Mr. Ouattara's party and strongly suggesting what many Ivoirians suspect -- that Mr. Ouattara's party knew of the coup beforehand. ""We realize that this is a coup d'etat by the R.D.R,"" Mr. Gbagbo said, using the Ouattara party's initials. ""It is a government by the R.D.R."" Mr. Ouattara, acutely aware as a former monetary fund official that being associated with a coup would create problems with international lenders, has denied any prior knowledge. Upon returning to Ivory Coast from a three-month exile in France, he immediately began describing the overthrow as a ""revolution"" of the Ivoirian people. Whatever it was, Mr. Bedie will probably not return here despite having declared that he will be his party's next presidential candidate. Authorities in his party said in a statement that they no longer recognized him as their leader. Mr. Bedie is ""on leave,"" the statement read, with the usual French politesse. Even here in Daoukro, people seem resigned to the fact that its native son is history. During the coup they feared reprisals, and elderly women and children fled into the forest. Most have now returned, though soldiers and police officials still restrict entry into town. The authorities let a reporter in but forbade taking photographs of the mosque and the new Hotel de la Paix, with the three separate bungalows for private presidential meetings that will never take place. People milling around the mosque were philosophical. ""In life, one man can't be in power forever,"" said Asate Konate, a woman in her 60's. ""Maybe the new government will take pity on us and finish the mosque."" Unlike others, Mamadou Sylla, a man in his 20's, said he had never dreamed the Yamoussoukro dream. ""The times had changed,"" Mr. Sylla said. ""There was multi partyism. Bedie would never have been able to push through the big projects that Houphouet created."" ""It was fair play,"" he said of Daoukro's status as the country's big loser. ""It was fair play."" It took an outsider, a police official assigned to Daoukro, to find the positive. ""Little by little the country will be developed,"" the official said, adding that the next president would do the same thing in his home region. ""Eventually,"" he predicted, ""each region in the country will have its own Hotel de la Paix."" The worry, the police official conceded, is whether the development can be maintained, or whether it will start slowly deteriorating as it has in Yamoussoukro. A new road leads east out of Daoukro, its dividing lines painted fresh, its shoulders meticulously marked off. Alongside are signs warning of schoolchildren crossing, setting speed limits, naming each little village at least three times -- extra touches unseen elsewhere in the country and certainly not in the potholed north. The road goes up and down lush reddish hills, cutting a swath through the region's verdant forest. It is a thoroughfare worthy of an American suburb, a drive pleasant enough to use in a Mercedes or Lexus commercial. About 25 miles east, the road comes to a year-old bridge over the Comoe River. The asphalt abruptly ends on the other side. Under the bridge, the engineers' chalk notes are still visible against the walls, near graffiti someone has scrawled: ""Forgive us our sins."" Koffi Kouakou, a cheerful 30-year-old farmer, crossed the bridge on his bicycle, drawn by the sight of a stranger standing with a notepad. ""Oh, we loved him so much!"" Mr. Kouakou exclaimed about Mr. Bedie. ""Because he was a son of Daoukro, he took care of us. We now have the Hotel de la Paix. We could have never imagined that before. It used to take us three hours to get from the center of town to this bridge before the road was paved, and we had to cross on a ferry."" ""Look at this bridge,"" he added, knitting his eyebrows and pointing to some cracks that had already appeared. ""They said they would fix this. But will they now? And will the road be completed?"" Mr. Kouakou pedaled away, returning in the direction he had come from, toward the asphalt. The other way, for about 30 miles, the road runs past gutters that have already been dug in villages, past big red X's on houses condemned to accommodate the future asphalt. It is a dusty road of dirt and decay and pebbles, paved only in the imagination of a deposed president and the people of Daoukro.  http://www.nytimes.com"9-Apr-00,AFRICA (94%); UNITED STATES (79%);,"Why shouldn't countries pay their bills? I have to pay mine. That's a critical question hanging over the ""dump the debt"" rally scheduled to take place on the Mall this afternoon, when demonstrators will urge international lenders to write off the hundreds of billions of dollars owed to them by the world's poorest nations. Without declaring bankruptcy and giving up control of our own finances, most of us cannot imagine being excused from paying back money we had borrowed--and if we did, we certainly wouldn't expect the bank to lend to us again. Even World Bank President James Wolfensohn--who supports a certain amount of debt relief himself--thinks it would be ""whimsical"" to cancel every nation's debt. ""If you have a society based on debt forgiveness,"" Wolfensohn said in February, ""who's going to invest in debt anymore? So you really screw up the market."" In more than one Third World embassy here in Washington, the same fear has been expressed. Of course these diplomats want debt relief. But their countries are poor, many of them devastated by natural disasters or civil wars, and they will surely need to borrow more money to survive and develop. What bank would throw good money after bad? Let's consider that question. In particular, let's consider Africa, the continent where 33 of the 41 Heavily Indebted Poor Countries--the HIPC nations, so defined by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund--can be found, and therefore the continent on which much of the debt-relief campaign is focused. Having spent much of the last 20 years reporting and writing from Africa, I'll begin with a bit of history.  The bottom began falling out of African economies in the early 1970s. Most nations had been independent for little more than a decade, and either didn't understand--or didn't want to--that the boom in prices for their mineral and agricultural exports was not permanent. Inexperienced or corrupt leaders borrowed, spent and then borrowed some more, urged on by Western commercial lenders eager to start earning interest on the petrodollars that had been deposited in their banks by newly flush OPEC moguls. This symbiosis of greedy governments and overeager lenders meant that billions of dollars flowed into African nations for economic expansion, which often took the form of huge industrialization projects and ostentatious, politically visible structures in capital cities. In addition, about 20 percent of the funds lent during these Cold War years went to arms purchases. Debt was increasing but new governments did not feel it. The lenders were getting their initial paybacks. Good money was borrowed and thrown after bad whenever needed. Everyone was making out like bandits; everyone, that is, except poor African citizens, growing in numbers and generally not sharing the wealth of their rulers. Then came the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979, which triggered worldwide inflation and recession. Prices for African commodities collapsed; prices for basic necessities like fuel and fertilizer skyrocketed. By the early 1980s, Africa was reeling just as repayment on loans taken out a few years earlier came due. Most of Africa's debt at that time was owed to private banks. When these institutions realized African nations could not cover their debts, they lobbied multilateral agencies such as the IMF to lend African countries the money to pay off the debts. That's how Citibank got out of bad loans to the country then called Zaire (and it helped that Mobutu Sese Seko's Zaire was a Cold War ally of the United States). Citibank got bailed out, but Zaire (now Congo) didn't--it just owed money to a different lender. Trapped in this ruinous cycle of debt servitude and underdevelopment, Africa and its people have paid a heavy price. Ironically, within this historical experience lie truths that argue for the possible success of debt relief. To put the argument briefly, things are changing in Africa, and some things already have changed significantly. These days, both banks and wealthy governments are much more cautious about their money. The rules for lending are tougher: The U.S. government can no longer simply sign off on a loan made for political reasons without paying attention to how the money will be used. Loans are made more responsibly than in the aggressive Cold War years. And the lenders have a practical goal: Africa, like China, does not have to be a drag on the world economy if it can use its natural resources and labor force in productive work. And developed economies would mean future markets for the West in Africa. Meanwhile, the governments seeking debt relief today are dramatically different than those that fell into ruin. Military rule and ""Big Man"" government have gone out of fashion in Africa; Mobutu and his fellow ""kleptocrats"" are largely gone. Africa's new governments, I believe, are smarter and less corrupt. I once asked Issaias Afwerki, president of Eritrea--a country that didn't exist as a separate entity a decade ago--what it had meant to his people to fight their 30-year war for independence from Ethiopia. ""If there was any good in a conflict of such length,"" Afwerki responded, ""it was that it gave you a chance to watch and learn from everybody's mistakes and to plan how to avoid them."" Apparently, he is avoiding at least some of them: The World Bank Web site advises that even though Eritrea has a per capita GNP less than half the African average, ""the economic outlook is promising because of sound management and relatively diversified production."" While democracy is far from perfected on the continent, I can tick off a list of leaders from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic who are seriously engaged in developing civil societies that respond to citizen concerns and needs. Certainly there are still regions of terrible armed conflict--Angola comes immediately to mind--but conflict need not define what Africa is today. As a practical matter, the continent is a better place to lend money than it was a generation ago. The truth of that statement is what underlies the African Growth and Opportunities Act, a House bill with broad bipartisan support that aims to promote development by easing trade barriers. If you're cynical, you'll say governments there will squander any new loans all over again. The Africa I see suggests the opposite. In fact, there already is a consensus among commercial banks, multilateral lending institutions and governments that there has to be debt relief. This is a pragmatic, not a charitable, conclusion. Every banker in the world knows that it has become impossible for the HIPCs to pay their staggering debts. African countries alone owe $ 227 billion; Mozambique's tab is $ 1.4 million a week.  To pay that off, every bit of work and every cent of earnings would have to go toward debt payments. That would be politically unsustainable--and if Mozambique's government collapses, nobody's going to get paid anything. That's why some lenders have already begun--slowly--to reduce the debt, through limited cancellation, some restructuring and some rescheduling. In fact, agreement was reached at an international summit in Cologne, Germany, last June to cancel about $ 111 billion of the $ 354 billion owed by poor nations. ""It's not like the [World] Bank, the [IMF] fund, and the United States are waiting for their money,"" Lisa Wright, a Church World Services official who tracks the debt issue closely, told me recently. In other words, the money has already been lost. So forgiving the debt usually means little more than changing an entry in a ledger. And how will that ledger entry be accounted for? Well, the IMF can make up some of its losses by selling off part of its 103-million-ounce gold reserves. The United States, Britain and other wealthy nations are kicking in some money to a new multilateral debt relief trust fund. (The European Union promises to put up $ 700 million when the United States hands over the $ 600 million it promised last year.) This is essentially foreign aid by another name; some brave bureaucrats are even willing to float the idea that instead of loans the poorest HIPCs should get direct grants. None of these partial measures, of course, satisfies critics like those in Jubilee 2000, the debt-relief group that has organized today's rally. They say that the ""structural adjustments"" proposed under the HIPC program would force debtor nations to make such strict economic reforms that they would have to abandon vital social programs. They have three broad but closely related objections to the HIPC program: It's too little too late; the burden of debt servicing is still too heavy; and it is designed to serve the needs of creditors rather than the poor. But the World Bank and the IMF emphatically reject full cancellation of debt as unrealistic. Cancellation would raise false expectations of assistance that could not be met because foreign aid money is so limited, they argue. Besides, they also say, sounding very much like a relief worker at the African grass roots, debt is only part of a larger social problem. The IMF and the World Bank also claim to have learned from past mistakes--and they want to make sure their largess is responsibly used. In the end, the question is not whether debt should be forgiven; it's how fast and to what extent. My experience suggests that the faster and broader the debt relief, the better for Africa--and the world.

The report, prepared jointly with the United Nations and African development institutions, said Ghana, Mozambique and Uganda were among a handful of African nations that have piloted a way out of extreme poverty. But it says that with AIDS, malaria and civil strife rising, conditions in the region as a whole are worsening. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the two leading international lending agencies, have come under intense scrutiny over their multibillion-dollar African aid programs. Protesters who ran noisy demonstrations in Washington at the spring meetings of the bank and the fund said the two institutions had made Africa poorer through failed policies, a position that the bank's analysis partly vindicates. The 280-page report acknowledges that the heavy flow of aid in recent decades did relatively little to ignite sustained economic growth, but the study adds that the World Bank has reinvented how it manages aid. ""The temptation is to retreat into pessimism,"" the bank's vice president for Africa, Callisto E. Madavo, said. ""But I think if you look at what we have been doing recently, you can see that we're really on the right track."" Sub-Saharan Africa is the only major region that moved backward in the later decades of 20th century, says the report, which catalogs the many woes while prescribing some remedies. In the early 1960's, African nations were widely considered more advanced than East Asian nations. But between that time and the end of the 90's, Africa retreated in real economic terms, while East Asia's economic output increased fourfold. Today, sub-Saharan Africa's 48 nations have a collective economic output that does not much surpass that of Belgium. Poland alone has more roads. Africa's share of world trade has steadily declined to less than 2 percent. Africa depends more on foreign aid today than ever, the reports says. Loans and grants from rich nations account for 10 percent of total economic activity, and a heavy debt burden constrains the ability of governments to put their fiscal houses in order. Infectious diseases like malaria and AIDS take more of a toll now than at any time since the early part of the 20th century. Africa accounts for 70 percent of the AIDS cases reported around the world. Even if progress against the disease is made, experts expect AIDS to reduce the average African life expectancy by 20 years, erasing all the gains since World War II. Endemic corruption and war, including the conflicts in Ethiopia as well as western and central Africa, are the main causes of the bleak performance, the report says. But the World Bank accepts some blame. The report says the bank and its sister agencies have wasted billions on ill-conceived projects. Even when projects were carefully managed, they sometimes competed with national governments, drawing talented bureaucrats and leaving nations ""project rich and cash poor,"" it says. The bank calls on rich countries to open their markets to imports of African goods. Wealthy nations collectively spend $300 billion to subsidize and protect their own farmers against foreign competition, the report says, a figure that is as large Africa's total economic output.  http://www.nytimes.com"6-Jun-00,CHAD (96%); UNITED STATES (95%); CAMEROON (94%); AFRICA (94%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%); FRANCE (77%);,"With American support, the World Bank is expected to approve on Tuesday a $3.5 billion project to develop an oil pipeline in Chad and Cameroon in West Africa, despite widespread concerns about the potential for corruption and environmental damage. The Clinton administration will vote in favor of World Bank sponsorship after specifying an unusually detailed list of safeguards that officials hope will earmark the oil revenues for development projects and ward off abuse, a senior American official said today. Although the project does not have united European support, the United States, as the major shareholder in World Bank, is confident that there will be enough votes for a loan to pass, the official said. Exxon Mobil is the lead company that is seeking the loan. The World Bank is generally expected to contribute $90 million to $200 million. The proposed 663-mile pipeline, which would link oil fields in landlocked Chad to the Atlantic Coast of Cameroon, has stirred an outcry among environmentalists and antipoverty crusaders. They say the project will provide a boon to corrupt African officials, dislocate indigenous peoples and harm ecologically sensitive areas. The senior American official said critics had ""very legitimate concerns."" But after more than two years working with the oil companies, officials and independent figures in both countries, he said, planners have come ""a very long way"" in addressing them. ""This is a project with substantial development potential,"" the official said. ""I'm confident that it will be approved."" Environmental groups contend that the companies have failed to set aside adequate money to clean up an oil spill, allocating less than $1 million, despite Dutch researchers' citing a need for $28 million. The pipeline, the critics add, will threaten the livelihoods of hundreds of Bagueli people, or pygmies, and endanger the habitats of endangered black rhinos, gorillas and chimpanzees. ""Any time you lay a pipeline, you're basically building a road for loggers and poachers,"" said Alejandro Queral, associate Washington representative of the Sierra Club. Other critics say the World Bank will effectively be lining the pockets of a corrupt government in Chad that the State Department says brutally persecutes its enemies. Nearly every region of Chad, a nation two and a half times the size of France, has erupted in ethnically based unrest. Providing oil revenues to the central government is ""like adding more fuel to the fire,"" asserted Korrina Horta, a senior economist at Environmental Defense in Washington. ""It's a very dangerous situation,"" Ms. Horta added. Exxon Mobil has insisted on World Bank participation as a hedge against instability, Ms. Horta said. She referred to the bank's role, which represents less than 10 percent of the project, as ""political risk insurance"" for investors. ""You make the World Bank a shareholder in the project, and no government is ever going to nationalize it,"" Ms. Horta said. In addition, the support clears the way for Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Petronas to seek additional financing before investing $3 billion of their own, she said, adding, ""It's the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval."" In tandem with its support for the loan, the administration has insisted on a framework to be monitored by the World Bank that would reduce the risk of corruption or mismanagement. That structure would include an escrow account for oil revenues that would set aside most of the income for health, education and development and allow for monitoring by nongovernmental groups in Chad. The American-backed strictures also require that money be set aside to create national parks, compensate displaced people and respond to oil spills. The pipeline would be one of the largest that involves direct foreign investment in Africa in decades, officials said. Experts expect it to generate $80 million to $100 million a year for Chad and $20 million in transfer fees for Cameroon. American officials acknowledged that the project would be something of a test for the World Bank. Last week, the bank released a report in which it faulted itself and the International Monetary Fund for making Africa poorer through failed lending policies over 40 years.  http://www.nytimes.com An article on Tuesday about the World Bank's consideration of an oil pipeline in Africa referred incorrectly to a recent report by the bank on African poverty. The study concluded that Africans were poorer than 40 years ago and that a share of the blame belonged to the bank and the International Monetary Fund. But the contention that the two organizations had made the continent poorer through failed lending policies came from recent Washington demonstrators, not from the study."7-Sep-00,"AFRICA (98%); UNITED KINGDOM (93%); IRAN, ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF (92%); UNITED STATES (92%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (92%); LATIN AMERICA (79%); MALDIVES (79%); RUSSIAN FEDERATION (79%); ISRAEL (79%); CHINA (79%); ASIA (79%); FRANCE (78%);","These are excerpts from speeches of world leaders yesterday at the United Nations, drawn from official transcripts: 'There can be change. There can be hope for Africa.' TONY BLAIR Prime Minister, Britain There is a dismal record of failure in Africa on the part of the developed world that shocks and shames our civilization. Twenty-one of the 44 countries in sub-Saharan Africa are affected by conflict which undermines efforts at development. Even worse, 10 times as many people died of AIDS in Africa last year as were killed in all continent's wars combined. Nowhere are more people dying needlessly from starvation, from disease, from conflict. Deaths caused not by acts of fate, but by acts of man. By bad governance, factional rivalries, state-sponsored theft and corruption. Nowhere are more people being left behind on the wrong side of a growing digital and educational divide, children being denied the opportunities that will transform the lives of their contemporaries elsewhere in the world. Yet, 30 years ago, the same depressing analysis might have been made of parts of Asia or Latin America. There can be change. There can be hope for Africa. There is political leadership, business opportunity and above all the will on behalf of people for a better future in Africa. We must be partners in the search for change and hope. 'Blind laws are offered like divine norms.' FIDEL CASTRO President, Cuba There is chaos in our world, both within the countries' borders and beyond. Blind laws are offered like divine norms that would bring peace, order, well-being and the security our planet so badly needs. That is what they would have us believe. Three dozen developed and wealthy nations that monopolize the economic, political and technological power have joined us in this gathering to offer more of the same recipes that have only served to make us poorer, more exploited and more dependent. There is not even discussion about a radical reform of this old institution -- born over a half-century ago when there were few independent nations -- to turn into a true representative body of the interests of all the peoples on Earth; an institution where no one would have the irritating and anti-democratic right of veto and where a transparent process could be undertaken to expand membership and representation in the Security Council, an executive body subordinated to the General Assembly, which should be the one making the decisions on such crucial issues as intervention and the use of force. It should be clearly stated that the principle of sovereignty cannot be sacrificed to an abusive and unfair order that a hegemonic superpower uses, together with its own might and strength, to try to decide everything by itself. That Cuba will never accept. 'A moral and humane world with liberty and progress.' MOHAMMAD KHATAMI President, Iran Democratic principles have gradually become the criteria of good-governance domestically. They deserve to become the new norm governing global interactions. Therefore, the exigencies of a few power holders should not supersede the interest of humanity through familiar practices of endorsement of undemocratic governments, not responsive to the will and needs of their people, and application of double and multiple standards of response to incidents around the globe. Moreover, the structure of power in our contemporary world must be reformed. In a global society whose constituents, much like equal individuals within nation-states, are nations of equal right and dignity, diverse cultures and civilizations can and should work collectively to build a moral and humane world with liberty and progress for all. 'We live in a society, not a marketplace.' BERTIE AHERN Prime Minister, Ireland The statistics of poverty and inequality in our world are shocking and shameful. Half the world's population struggling on less than $2 a day; over a billion on less than $1. A quarter of a billion children of 14 and under working, sometimes in terrible conditions. Death from preventable and treatable diseases; 10 people will die of malaria in the five minutes I take to address you. There was much talk some years ago of a ""new world order."" A new order is indeed dawning. The capacity of globalization to transform our economies and societies is enormous. But, unless shaped by a value system, globalization will mean an ever more lopsided world. The level playing field will remain an illusion as long as a majority of players are ill fed, ill trained and ill equipped. Perhaps the phrase ""fair world order"" better sums up what we should strive for. It recognizes that we live in a society, not a marketplace. It admits concepts of justice and human solidarity. It acknowledges that, while not everyone will live in the same way, we are all entitled to dignity and decency. 'At the Rubicon, and neither of us can cross it alone.' EHUD BARAK Prime Minister, Israel The opportunity for peace in the Middle East is now at hand, and must not be missed. We envision a peace that will preserve the vital interests and the dignity of all sides. But no one side can achieve 100 percent of its dreams if we are to succeed. My own government has shown, in negotiations with Syria and the Palestinians, as in our full implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, that it can make painful decisions for the sake of peace. It remains to be seen whether our counterparts are also capable of rising to the magnitude of the hour. The member states of the United Nations can lend a pivotal hand by encouraging the difficult process of reconciliation, and by opposing any unilateral measures, which may well spark a renewed cycle of violence and obliterate the prospects of peace. I call out to Chairman Arafat to join me in this historic passage. We are at the Rubicon, and neither of us can cross it alone. 'New horizons for secure life on the planet.' VLADIMIR V. PUTIN President, Russia The new century of the United Nations should prolong itself into a millennium of effective stability. It has to enter the annals of history as the period of real disarmament. . . . We should reliably block the ways for spreading of nuclear weapons. We can achieve this by, inter alia, excluding usage of enriched uranium and pure plutonium in the world atomic energy production. This is technically quite possible to implement. But more important is that incineration of plutonium and other radioactive elements creates prerequisites for the final solution of the radioactive residues problem. It opens fundamentally new horizons for secure life on the planet. In this connection Russia proposes to work out and put into practice a relevant mechanism with the participation of the I.A.E.A. Particularly alarming are the plans for militarization of the outer space. In spring of 2001 we shall celebrate the 40th anniversary of the first flight of man to the outer space. That man was our compatriot, and we suggest to organize on that date, under the umbrella of the U.N., an international conference on prevention of the outer space militarization. I think that the most proper place for it shall be Moscow.  'As part of a global village, we should work together.' HASINA WAZED Prime Minister, Bangladesh Can we afford islands of prosperity in an ocean of suffering and darkness? Let us resolve that as part of a global village, we should work together so that all can benefit from the process of globalization and we can have a win-win at the end. Globalization and a borderless world are not a panacea for all social and economic ills. While they can reinforce the rich and the powerful, they can also impoverish the weak and the vulnerable. 'We all know that the U.N. plays a major role.' JACQUES CHIRAC President, France Our world, which is still fraught with political, economic and financial crises, does not suffer from a surfeit of rules, but from the problems of keeping international law and practices abreast of change and progress. If we are to build a world order that meets the needs of our times, we must strengthen and improve the coexistence of great institutions such as I.M.F., the World Bank, the W.T.O. and, first of all, the U.N. We all know that the U.N. plays a major role. In its first half-century of existence, this universal, democratic institution has become irreplaceable. We must let it adapt to today's world.  By modernizing the methods of the General Assembly, which is the world's Parliament in a way. By supporting the reforms undertaken by our secretary general, Mr. Kofi Annan, whom I would like to salute here. By making the best use of the information revolution. And finally, by providing the necessary resources, as the European Union countries do, supplying more than one-third of the budget and half of the financing for U.N. funds and programs. This will enable the U.N. to fulfill its duties and influence the course of world history. 'There should not be only one color in the universe.' JIANG ZEMIN President, China The world is diverse and colorful. Just as there should not be only one color in the universe, so there should not be only one civilization, one social system, one development model or one set of values in the world. Each and every country and nation has made its own contribution to the development of human civilization. It is essential to fully respect the diversity of different nations, religions and civilizations, whose co-existence is the very source of vigorous development in the world. We should promote the exchanges between different civilizations in a spirit of equality and democracy and encourage them to learn from one another in order to attain common progress. Dialogue and cooperation in the field of human rights must be conducted on the basis of respect for state sovereignty. This is the fundamental and most effective way to protect and promote human rights. So long as there are boundaries between states, and people live in their respective countries, to maintain national independence and safeguard sovereignty will be the supreme interests of each government and people. Without sovereignty, there will be no human rights to speak of. 'Inaction speaks louder than words.' MAUMOON ABDUL GAYMOOM President, Maldives To those who learn from mistakes the past is a good guide for the future. But let us not go back a thousand years. Let us go forward to a hundred years hence. When the U.N. meets to usher in yet another century, will the Maldives and other low-lying island nations be represented here? Not only a sobering thought, but an alarming one. Now, I have only 30 seconds left. It would be a pity to disperse from this gathering without a final commitment to save the earth. I don't wish to be cynical, but, are we to believe that the world really cares? Are we to believe that all humanity is one? Inaction speaks louder than words.  http://www.nytimes.com"18-Sep-00,ANGOLA (99%); SOUTHERN AFRICA (79%);,"The cargo planes that keep this city alive land every few hours, trembling to a halt amid cracked concrete and yawning potholes. With the roads already close to impassable, relief workers worry that the approaching rainy season will shut the airport as well, hobbling their efforts to deliver food to thousands of peasants who pour into Kuito each month, chased from the countryside by an unyielding civil war. Flush with money from Angola's offshore oil fields, the government in the past year has recaptured all provincial capitals that had been held by the country's rebels, including this town in the central highlands. But Kuito's center remains a wreck of half-demolished colonial-era buildings and homes blistered with bullet holes, its perimeter a dangerous ring of live explosives and unburied corpses. Refugees have plunged a few sticks into the soft reddish dirt to mark a football-size field of land mines near where they camp in grass huts. With too little food and too few schools, idle, rail-thin children with pot bellies dance barefoot around the minefield. Every few months, a child is blown to bits. This southern African country--a former Portuguese colony about the size of Texas--is potentially the richest on the continent. Angola produces nearly 800,000 barrels of crude oil a day, more than Kuwait. But the wells may as well be bone dry for all the good they do most of the country's 12 million people. A civil war that is closing in on its 26th year sops up most of the oil windfall, and corruption eats away much of what remains, leaving the bulk of the population with nothing. Only six countries produce more petroleum than Angola, yet more than three-quarters of its population remains desperately poor. Nearly 2 million people would starve without food shuttled into Angola by the World Food Program and distributed by relief agencies. ""Billions of dollars of oil and yet the people see none of it,"" said Domingos Jorge, an Angolan aid worker in Kuito. ""What gets done here is done by the [aid agencies]--housing, building schools, feeding the hungry, water and sanitation, caring for the sick, de-mining. The government does nothing but wage war and stuff their pockets."" What began largely as an ideological war by proxy between the Cold War superpowers and their allies has disintegrated into a gruesome battle over the country's mineral riches, particularly its relatively untapped oil fields deep in the Atlantic Ocean, according to military analysts, diplomats and an emerging civil society of journalists, clerics and opposition politicians. Many foreign countries and international organizations accuse the rebels of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) of breaking a 1994 peace treaty two years ago. But analysts, diplomats and this country's exhausted population are increasingly questioning whether the formerly Marxist governing party, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), is using the war's resumption as a ruse to skim oil revenues through phony arms deals and other corrupt schemes. Last year, after international petroleum companies paid Angola $ 900 million for exploration rights, the government devoted half the money to a military offensive that has pushed UNITA into the bush. It's anyone's guess what happened to the other $ 450 million since the bonus was not included in the government's published budget. But suspicions are as abundant as oil in Angola, which two years ago spent more on cars for cabinet ministers, legislators and their wives than it did on health and education for its citizens. An economist here estimated that corruption costs Angola $ 800 million annually. Global Witness, an international human rights and environmental organization, accused high-ranking government officials last year of using oil revenue to buy arms from Russian mobsters, then selling them to the government through bogus companies at inflated prices. Oil company officials working in Africa say it's impossible to operate in Angola without bribing top officials. Oil executives in Luanda, the capital, carry not only the cell phone numbers but the Swiss bank account numbers of key government ministers, an oil executive said. Meanwhile, a war that has cost at least 500,000 lives grinds on, reducing the average life expectancy to just 42 years. One-third of all Angolan children die before the age of 5, and of those who survive to adulthood, more than half are illiterate, partly because there aren't enough schools. The government spends more than a third of its meager education budget on scholarships for relatives of governing party officials to study abroad. ""The government has created a stateless state here in Angola,"" said Rafael Marques, a journalist who was jailed and convicted of defamation for an article last year in which he characterized President Jose Eduardo dos Santos as a dictator. ""Each citizen is responsible for his own health and welfare while the government is accountable to no one. The MPLA and UNITA are like two gangs and the people of Angola are innocent bystanders caught in the middle of a drive-by shooting."" A year ago, many Angolans and foreign diplomats were optimistic that the government's surprising military surge might finally defeat Jonas Savimbi's UNITA militia, which was heavily financed by diamonds mined in the Cuango River valley. But while the MPLA forced the rebels to abandon their strongholds and the diamond revenues needed to pay for major ground offensives, UNITA has simply resorted to guerrilla warfare, fighting government soldiers and terrorizing civilians almost daily in attacks on the periphery of Kuito and other towns. With any chance of an imminent military resolution apparently faded, Angolans have begun to prod the colorless, reclusive and autocratic dos Santos to negotiate a peace settlement with his bitter rival, Savimbi. The arrest of Marques, and the brutal treatment by police of people who assembled in Luanda earlier this year to protest the government's 1,700 percent increase in gasoline prices, appear to have widened dissent within a war-weary population that in the past has been reluctant to challenge its brutally oppressive government. In recent months, opposition politicians have publicly demanded that dos Santos be tried for treason, and Roman Catholic clergymen sponsored a four-day conference in July intended to begin a national dialogue of peace and reconciliation. The independent media have countered the pro-government newspaper's version of events with forceful calls for a more accountable government. ""Happy Birthday Chief,"" read a front page headline in the independent weekly Folha 8, mocking dos Santos's lavish birthday party at his compound. ""The generals and the people are starving,"" the headline concluded, referring to the aging military heroes who led this country's war for independence from Portugal, which ended in 1975. ""This kind of defiance would have been almost unthinkable two years ago,"" said Imaculada Melo, an attorney and executive director of the Angolan Civic Association, which has lobbied the government for political and economic reforms. ""I think there's a transformation taking place. For too long the politicians in this country have ignored the needs of the people, and we see them driving new cars and living in nice homes. Always, their excuse is the war, always the war."" Following its independence, Angola became a Cold War battlefield, with the United States and the white-minority government in South Africa supporting Savimbi's forces against the Marxist ruling party, backed by the Soviet Union and Cuba. Angola slipped from the West's radar screen in the years immediately after the collapse of Soviet communism, but oil has returned it to center stage, diplomatic officials said. The United States buys 7 percent of its oil from Angola, a figure that U.S. officials say could easily double in a climate of peace and stability. Chevron Corp., BP Amoco PLC, Exxon Mobil Corp. and nearly two dozen other oil companies plan to invest roughly $ 20 billion here over the next decade. The Clinton administration abandoned the traditional U.S. courtship of Savimbi in 1995 and threw its support to dos Santos, a leftist turned free marketer. The United States has been instrumental in brokering a deal between Angola and the International Monetary Fund that would require the government to open its books to outside auditors for the first time and spend more on domestic programs in exchange for donor assistance. And earlier this month the United States joined Russia and Portugal in calling for the international community to toughen its sanctions against UNITA rebels. Still, some U.S. officials acknowledged that the administration is reluctant to criticize Angola's corruption or woeful human rights record because of American oil interests here. Rhetorically, at least, the governing party seems responsive to the growing domestic and foreign pressure. Last month, dos Santos said that his government would offer amnesty to the rebels, including Savimbi, if they comply with the 1994 cease-fire agreement. The government also has announced a $ 250 million program of economic development and infrastructure improvements. Dos Santos has suggested that he may hold national elections next year. The last time Angolans voted for a government, in 1992, Savimbi rejected the results once it appeared that he faced defeat and quickly went back to war. ""Peace is the first and the main concern,"" said Manuel Augusto, Angola's minister of social communication. ""The main threat by Mr. Savimbi to take power by force is over, and we are very confident in our future. We would like to have the elections in 2001 if we achieve a significant level of stability and peace."" While acute, Angola's problems with corruption are hardly unique in societies in transition. That does not, however, make life any easier for Joao Gregorio, a farmer who fled the fighting near his village 30 miles outside Kuito. The entire village now lives in a crowded, sweltering refugee camp of mud huts, surviving on corn and beans provided by relief agencies. When a reporter asked Gregorio about Angola's paradox of petroleum and poverty, the slightly built man stared blankly for a moment, then wiped the sweat from his brow as a puzzled look formed on his face. ""What oil?"" he asked."24-Sep-00,ANGOLA (99%); UNITED STATES (79%); PORTUGAL (79%);,"A mile beneath the emerald waves lies some of the hottest real estate in the world. Next year Angola hopes to pump a million barrels of oil daily from the ocean floor. By 2010 rigs like this one in the South Atlantic may export more crude than Kuwait. Twenty-five years ago, Angola's first black government dreamed of harnessing this energy to improve the lives of its desperately poor people. But if the gods rained gold on Angola, the wealth has been largely consumed by the government and its war machine, fueling the continent's longest-running civil conflict. Yet Angola, a symbol of the worst kind of subversion of natural riches, now teeters on the brink of fresh opportunity. With the civil war ebbing and oil prices soaring, the government is taking tentative steps to redirect its vast oil revenues toward rebuilding the country. In a detailed agreement with the International Monetary Fund made public last month, the government has promised to increase spending on health and education nearly threefold and to allow independent auditors to scrutinize its figures on oil profits, which make up 90 percent of export income and have not previously been fully disclosed. The government apparently hopes to gain access to the fund's low-interest loans and to shed its image of callous corruption that has allowed a generation to grow up with only faint memories of electricity or running water or houses without bullet holes. Angola's history is littered with broken promises and squandered opportunities, and whether President Jose Eduardo dos Santos will make good on his commitments remains unclear. But the government's shift corresponds with strong signals that the public is increasingly unwilling to keep enduring misery. For the first time, people have stood up by the thousands to protest the endless war, corruption and wasted revenues in a country that is at once the eighth-largest supplier of oil to the United States and one of the world's poorest nations. In June, in the largest of a series of protests that began eight months ago, about 6,000 people walked through the cracked and buckled streets of the capital, Luanda, to a stadium to call for peace. This week, Catholic leaders met in the provincial town of Uige to press the government to respect human rights and to begin a dialogue with the rebels, who have been considerably weakened by government soldiers in the past year. They are small but significant steps for a people who have shied from challenging a government that often arrests and jails journalists and demonstrators who question the status quo. But it only takes a visit to Angola's crumbling cities to understand the discontent. So far this year, as the country marks a quarter-century of independence from Portugal, at least eight people have starved to death in prison because the government did not provide enough food, the state-controlled newspaper reported. More than a third of the children admitted to the country's best pediatric hospital die, partly because they get inadequate care there, the hospital's annual report concedes.  And while oil revenues have surged, the government investment in health has dropped from 8 percent of total spending in 1991 to 2.8 percent in 1999, according to the International Monetary Fund and health experts. Still, the unusual convergence of recent events has ignited unexpected flickers of optimism. An international campaign against diamond smuggling, the primary source of income for the rebels who have opposed the government for virtually the entire period of independence, has made it difficult for them to rearm. The government no longer threatens to kill the rebel leader, Jonas Savimbi, and promises pardons to rebels willing to lay down their guns. Over the last four years, more oil has been found in Angola than in any other country, and companies are expected to offer millions just to peek below the waves. This month, the world's biggest oil companies began frenzied bidding for the right to explore the latest underwater expanse opened by the government. And these days, some dare to dream that this bountiful oil -- which has increased profits of American companies like Chevron and Texaco, helped buy government tanks and AK-47's and reportedly lined some official pockets -- may someday end up helping the hungry. ""Just a few years ago, this hope we have now would have been unthinkable,"" said Luis Maria Perez de Onraita, the bishop of Malanje Province and one of the most outspoken Catholic leaders in the fledgling peace movement, which held its first national congress in July. He has seen two peace accords collapse over the past ten years. He has watched children die from malnutrition in a country that once exported food to the world. He is 67 now, and creases line his forehead and silver glimmers in his hair. He has grown old waiting for peace. ""At times we feel like voices in the desert, worthless,"" the bishop said. ""Perhaps we are fighting for a utopia. But we cannot continue as we are. Angola is rich, but what good is that if the Angolan people themselves do not benefit?"" The Portuguese, who began exporting oil in the 1950's, made no pretense of sharing the wealth. And after independence in 1975, Angolans watched their own leaders turn on one another in cold war battles. On one side was Mr. dos Santos's party, the Marxist Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, backed by the Russians and the Cubans. On the other was the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, led by Mr. Savimbi and supported by the United States and the apartheid regime of South Africa. When the cold war ended, the fighting continued, financed with the profits from diamond and oil sales. Mr. Savimbi violated both peace treaties of the 1990's and returned to war, most recently in 1998. But even during a period of relative peace from 1994 to 1998, the government accomplished little, despite huge oil revenues. Today, fewer than 5 percent of municipalities have functioning justice systems and fewer than half of school-age children attend school, according to the United Nations. And without the World Food Program, about 1.5 million people would be at risk of starvation. Yet the nation's oil accounts have remained largely secret until now. ""People talk about corruption, and I think there is corruption here and there,"" conceded Hendrik Vaal Neto, the minister of communications, who works in a shabby office where the elevator seems permanently frozen between floors. ""But I don't think this a corrupt government or a corrupt country, no. There is corruption everywhere in the world. People seem to forget there was a need for rapid re-equipping of the army and air force, and you don't get that for nothing."" The situation now is different, he continued. ""We are in a better position, and the economy and social problems of the people are our main concern. Can we miraculously solve our problems? No, no one can do that. But now you will see the government doing more."" In fact, as he was speaking earlier this month, government officials were scrambling to meet the International Monetary Fund's December deadline. The United States needs Angola's oil, and some American officials concede that this need dampens their willingness to chastise Angola or demand too much, too quickly. The government, which has billions of dollars in bad debts, needs the fund's seal of approval to restore its creditworthiness. And while it is unlikely that officials will meet that December deadline, economists familiar with the negotiations said it would probably be extended to allow the government more time to redirect its spending and to carry out reforms. ""This is the best chance at the moment that we have of any leverage on the government,"" said Alex Vines, the Angola researcher for Human Rights Watch, who has been critical of the government. ""There is a possibility, a glimmer of hope,"" Mr. Vines said in a telephone interview from London. ""They understand they have to improve their image. But whether their action is very cosmetic and superficial is the question."" In their report last month, officials of the fund said they were ""encouraged by the authorities' commitment to the reform program."" But the disparity between oil revenues and the lives of ordinary people is still enormous. On the Pride Angola, the deep-water drill bores through the seabed, using technology unavailable even 10 years ago. The British oil company BP-Amoco has been exploring this stretch of water known as Block 18 for more than two years now. So far, every place it has drilled it has hit gold. Interest among foreign oil companies is so intense that the government plans to inaugurate direct corporate jet service between the oil capitals of Houston and Luanda by the end of the year. ""There are not many places around to make these kind of discoveries,"" said Martin Eldon, the managing director of Texaco's Angola office. ""That's what all the excitement is about."" But that means nothing in Uige, where the town clock is stuck at 3 o'clock and the only oil anyone seems to know about are the metal cans of kerosene and gasoline sold in the state oil company shop. There was a time when electricity and piped water coursed through the town, and the authorities lined the avenues with street lights and installed faucets and sinks in hospitals and schools. These days, hospital orderlies lug in sloshing jugs and buckets of water to bathe patients and flush latrines. And at night, the town sinks into a smoky haze of charcoal fires and candlelight.  http://www.nytimes.com Map of Angola shows the location of Ambriz: Drilling off Ambriz could yield one of the richest oil fields."29-Oct-00,AFRICA (99%); COTE D'IVOIRE (95%); UNITED STATES (92%); LATIN AMERICA (79%); RWANDA (79%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%); MAURITANIA (79%); LIBERIA (79%); NIGERIA (79%);,"WITH its running tableau of disasters, both man-made and natural, Africa in the 1990's has shown an unerring knack for inspiring hand-wringing in the outside world and increasing self-doubt among Africans themselves about the waste and futility of half a century of independence. Now, like an exclamation mark, the century may be closing on the descent into chaos of what has long been one of Africa's brightest corners, the former French West African country where a deeply flawed election last week produced rampaging mobs and ethnically motivated lynching, not democratic rule. By week's end, negotiations among the power seekers had begun, and an uneasy calm had taken hold. Still, the death toll was well over 100. The trouble in Ivory Coast could be seen coming for at least five years, visible on the horizon like the darkness of a gathering storm. But as predictable as the disputed vote and the killings may seem, they were never inevitable. Ivory Coast's crisis has its roots in the usual cynicism and blind ambition of politicians, but just as surely in the indifference of an onlooking world. Where Africa is concerned, it seems, extinguishing fires before they can get out of hand is scarcely ever tried. For most Americans, the name of this country with 17 million inhabitants means nothing. In fact, there are few places in Africa today that could give the world more reason to care. For a stretch of countries from Mauritania to Nigeria, Ivory Coast, despite its modest size, has been something akin to what the United States has often been to Latin America. It has absorbed many far poorer neighbors -- more than 25 percent of the population is now foreign. With its huge exports of cocoa and coffee, sizable industrial base, good roads and working electricity and telephones (such things are not taken for granted in Africa, even today), Ivory Coast has served as the region's employer, its breadbasket, its banker, its educator and its hub. For years, foreigners there have repeated the joke about loving to live in the capital, Abidjan, ""because it's so convenient to Africa."" More important, though, this was one of those rare African places that had a large and worldly middle class. If Ivory Coast's slide goes unchecked, all that will vanish. One need only visit Liberia next door, with its skyscrapers full of squatters, to see what a gutted capital looks like, and to realize that what took generations to build can burn in a blink. Emulation has always worked powerfully in Africa politics. In the 1960's, an often well-intentioned but ultimately disastrous socialism was in vogue. In the 1970's and 1980's, leaders began naming themselves president for life. In the mid-1990's, with the Rwandan crisis, deadly mobilization along openly ethnic lines reared its head, spreading quickly through much of East and Central Africa. EVEN in faraway West Africa, Rwandization has become a familiar verb. For several years now, as in Rwanda, politicians have been playing to their ethnic bases, with the result that Ivory Coast is now seriously divided into three regions of roughly equal size: a Muslim north with cultural links to Mali and Burkina Faso, a Christian southeast, which has dominated the country's history, and a Christian and animist southwest with strong ancestral ties to Liberia and Guinea. If this sounds familiar, it should. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, broke down along almost identical lines, leading to the Biafran War in 1967. The fear of many Africa watchers is that even worse than the regional economic disaster it would occasion, an ethnic explosion of Ivory Coast would set a pattern for the region for years to come. In fact, Nigeria is facing a resurgence of ethnic violence now. ""An Ivory Coast set ablaze by ethnic hatred will light a fire clear across this region,"" said one Western diplomat with longtime experience in West Africa. ""The only way to prevent it is for the world to engage all of the parties there and press them to respect some basic principles, especially the principle of compromise."" Many Africans have been waiting for France to lead an international effort to pressure Ivory Coast's factions to negotiate. But the wait has been in vain. The United States has condemned many of the worst abuses in Ivory Coast, where its interests are few. But France, without whose help the former colony's economy cannot run, has remained largely silent , providing support and justification for leaders even as their abuses have grown more flagrant. While Communism was falling in Eastern Europe a decade ago, much of Africa was experiencing popular revolutions of its own. In Mali, Benin, Congo and elsewhere, citizens who organized to demand democracy were overthrowing corrupt dictators. With little special outside help or attention, many of these early experiments in African democracy quickly foundered. But France, the only former colonial power to have maintained strong ties to its ex-possessions, worried that the end of personalized power under long-ruling dictators would open the region up to influence from others, notably the United States, and upset its interests in everything from oil fields to military bases. Early in the 1990's, Paris decided to stem its losses by backstopping corrupt regimes in Ivory Coast, Cameroon and Gabon, resource-rich states that provided handsome returns. With the implicit backing of the French President Jacques Chirac, who had already said that Africa was ""not ready for democracy,"" Henri Konan Bedie, the Ivory Coast leader who took power after the death of the country's founder, set out to eliminate his most important rival, a former prime minister named Alassane Ouattara. From 1995 until the end of last year, when he was overthrown in the country's first coup, Mr. Bedie ceaselessly improvised at eliminating his rival, a former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Bedie invented a bogus ideology, called Ivoirite, which sought to distinguish purebred citizens, mostly deemed to be his own southern Christians, from supposed latecomers, especially northern Muslims like Mr. Ouattara. This played on long-standing, latent hatreds. Mr. Bedie's southeastern Akan group had enjoyed the fruits of education and ultimately the power that grew out of their early contact with French colonizers. The Akan, who saw themselves as natural rulers, thought of the Muslim northerners as a ""dirty"" people. The southwesterners were disparaged as hotheaded near-savages. France never seemed to tire of Mr. Bedie, but the Ivorian people did. Last Christmas Eve he was overthrown in an army coup that seemed intended to right his wrongs. That is, until the new president, Gen. Robert Guei discovered the intoxicating effect of ethnic exclusionism. Soon, he, too, was changing the rules to keep Mr. Ouattara out. General Guei eliminated over a dozen rival candidates for the presidency, including those of the two largest parties, making a sham of this month's election. Having barred them from the race, the unpopular general was surprised to be soundly defeated in a low turnout by Laurent Gbagbo, a pioneer of the country's democracy movement. AFTER the stunned general sought to proclaim himself president anyway, his military government was literally chased from office by tens of thousands of supporters of Mr. Gbagbo, who now claimed power. But in a country badly divided along ethnic lines, this left two-thirds of the population dangerously disgruntled and unrepresented, setting up the terrifying street confrontations between supporters of Mr. Gbagbo and Mr. Ouattara. While much of the world, from Kofi Annan and the State Department to the South African President Thabo Mbeki and the Organization of African Unity called for new, free elections, the French government, which has always seemed more preoccupied with African power than with process, rushed to back Mr. Gbagbo. ""Don't expect comments from us that could resemble a show of paternalism or lesson-giving,"" said a government spokesman responding to criticism by the French press for backing the winner of a bogus election out of pure expediency. ""It is not the French role.""  http://www.nytimes.com"8-Dec-00,CHAD (94%); AFRICA (93%);,"THE NATION of Chad is war-torn, land-locked and destitute: Its average per capita income comes to just 55 cents daily. And yet, rather than help Chad fight illiteracy, high infant mortality rates or any of its other challenges, the international community may now have a duty to do the opposite. The government of President Idriss Deby has violated the terms of a huge oil development program concluded with the World Bank just six months ago. Unless Chad steps back into line quickly, it deserves neither the debt relief that it is due to apply for this month nor any further help in building its oil pipeline. Development aid understandably has critics. The money sent to poor countries with weak institutions sometimes gets wasted, or even goes to finance bad policies that deepen misery. The case for aid therefore depends on attaching conditions to it, and on being prepared to stop the flow of assistance when the conditions are not met. Just at the moment, for example, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund are arranging debt reduction for poor countries. But in order to qualify, the countries have to say how they will use the freed-up cash to reduce poverty. If donors did not require that commitment, debt relief might end up financing villas for presidential cronies. In Chad's case, the World Bank has devised an especially elaborate system of conditions, because it has backed an especially controversial project: a 650-mile oil pipeline, the biggest infrastructure development now underway in Africa, to connect Chad's oil fields to the Atlantic Ocean. The scheme was attacked by environmentalists, who feared harm to the rain forest, and by people who saw that past oil windfalls have done more to stoke corruption in poor countries than to promote development. The World Bank countered by setting up a special accounting system for the oil revenues and demanding that they be spent on education, health and other worthwhile causes. The bank even argued that this ""Chadian model"" would point the way to resource-led development in other poor countries. This seemed a fair bet six months ago, and we supported the project. But Mr. Deby has now diverted $ 4.5 million from the oil project to finance arms purchases, declaring that without security there can be no development. Even if you concede that Mr. Deby might need weapons to defend his government from rebels, there is no question that he violated the terms of the oil agreement. Unless Mr. Deby makes amends swiftly, it will be hard to justify further aid to him. This is a tough call: Cutting off aid would condemn Chad's people to continued poverty. But the World Bank has to accept that it can't battle illiteracy or infant mortality in countries whose rulers are not committed to those objectives. Financing arms purchases won't help Chad to escape poverty, and allowing Mr. Deby to violate donor conditions with impunity would damage the World Bank's ability to promote sound policies throughout the developing world."24-Dec-00,ANGOLA (99%); UNITED STATES (93%); AFRICA (93%); EUROPE (79%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%); PORTUGAL (76%);,"The morning wind whistles through the bullet holes in the tiny house on Teofilo-Braga Street. The electricity is out again. And Agostinho Capitango shuffles through the dark, his wooden leg dragging, as he considers his rusting faucets. ""We used to take showers when there was water,"" he said. ""That was in 1992."" In the far-flung provincial capitals of America's eighth-largest oil supplier, history has seemingly reversed course, leaving entire communities with dimming memories of modernity. Here, wheelbarrows and bicycles wobble along avenues once clogged by automobiles. Street lights have been blinded by rifle fire. There is no running water, no postal service, no garbage collection and scant rehabilitation for a shattered town where collapsed roofs, missing walls and other scars from the continuing civil war disfigure nearly every building. Angola is vowing to rebuild its broken cities after decades of war, neglect and squandered riches. The government just recently allowed foreign auditors to begin their accounting of the country's oil revenues for the first time and renewed promises to increase spending on crumbling infrastructure, all in an effort to secure low-interest loans from the West. But the measures -- which have been praised by the State Department and the International Monetary Fund -- have only exposed the magnitude of the task ahead. This country may surpass Kuwait in oil exports by 2010, but it is still crippled by an inefficient and corrupt public service, decaying infrastructure and attacks by a weakened but unrepentant rebel army, say diplomats and local and United Nations officials. In November, the government decided to commemorate 25 years of independence from Portugal by pardoning rebel soldiers and pumping water to thousands of homes on Independence Day, Nov. 11. One month later, the rebel leadership rejected the olive branch. And Mr. Capitango's tap is still dry. Forty years have passed since sub-Saharan Africa began shaking off colonial rule to harness the continent's natural riches for its oppressed people. Today, one of every five Africans lives in a country severely disrupted by conflict. And the wealth that once enriched Europe's colonial powers now fuels many of those wars. The World Bank estimates that conflicts in Central and West Africa have cost those regions more than $1 billion and $800 million respectively. In Angola, where the continent's longest-running civil war simmers, the toll is achingly apparent in communities undone by violence, poverty and corruption even as oil exports boom. About a quarter of the country's 13 million people have been forced to flee their homes since war erupted after independence in 1975. The World Food Program, which issued an urgent appeal for donations this month, struggles to feed nearly a million people. And every day, about 500 children die from malnutrition, disease and exploding land mines. Leprosy and polio -- illnesses virtually eradicated in the West -- are rampant. Rebels and bandits roam freely through vast swaths of the country, making roads impassable. And since the national airline refuses to fly to most stretches of the interior, most Angolans are stranded in remote towns that seem like islands in dangerous waters. In a roofless, doorless warehouse of this isolated, destroyed city, a war-weary graffiti writer vents his people's frustration on the cement walls. ""Angola says, 'Enough!' "" he cried in his black scrawl. President Jose Eduardo dos Santos blames the continuing misery on the rebels, who have reneged on two peace agreements since 1990. But criticism of Mr. dos Santos is mounting as the United Nations, human rights groups and ordinary Angolans increasingly raise pointed questions about how the government is spending its wealth. Deeply indebted and desperate for low-interest loans, the government finally agreed this year to open its oil accounts to the I.M.F. and to redirect its oil revenues from defense toward rebuilding, a move that Human Rights Watch has described as ""a positive first step."" ""The government of the Republic of Angola recognizes that the present still remains marked by numberless difficulties,"" the government told the nation in an Independence Day communique. ""The government of unity and reconciliation is already implementing deep, wide-ranging reforms."" I.M.F. officials, who are still assessing Mr. dos Santos's commitment, say the government pledged $90 million for public repairs this year. There are reports of a new power station in Humpata, a repaired dam in Matala, running water in Huambo, new money for roads, hospitals and housing. But that message has yet to trickle down to the bureaucrats click-clacking on manual typewriters in dusty offices without electric lights. Salomao Canhanga, a 49-year-old administrator, works in the housing rehabilitation bureau, but he admits that there is no housing rehabilitation happening here. His friends and neighbors beg for help with the gaping holes left by falling mortar shells. Mr. Canhanga tells them the office has no money for repairs. Even he has to scavenge for wood planks and straw mats to replace the glass windows in his house that were shattered by rebel attacks seven years ago. As for sanitation? He shrugs his shoulders. ""Those workers don't have cars,"" Mr. Canhanga said gloomily. ""We don't have trash cans. We have nothing, nothing."" Mr. Canhanga earns about $16 a month and grows vegetables to feed his family. His youngest son, born in 1994, has only fuzzy memories of glass windows or houses without bullet holes. And these days, some of Mr. Canhanga's colleagues look back on their Portuguese oppressors with nostalgia. ""There's a feeling of sadness,"" Mr. Canhanga admitted. ""People see independence as suffering. That's how they understand it. Some people say, 'When is this independence going to end?' "" Underpaid and undersupplied, provincial bureaucrats have abdicated most responsibilities to foreign charities. The World Food Program repairs classrooms and feeds nearly half of the town's 220,000 people. Oxfam builds water pumps. Doctors Without Borders provides supplies and medicines at the local hospital; it says the government covers only about 1 percent of the operating costs. The government is technically responsible for the town generator, the water supply, the roads, defense and administration. But when officials tried to restore water on Independence Day, the underground pipes were so corroded that most people ended up without even a drop. In its most recent report, the I.M.F. estimates that 40 percent of government spending went for defense in 1999, compared with 5 percent for social issues like health and education. Human rights groups say corrupt officials have siphoned off millions, a charge the government denies. What is clear, however, is that the government is still unprepared to rescue this graceful colonial city once known for its gardens, its fountains and its rich soil. In the vast camps for displaced people, babies with polio creep on hopelessly deformed limbs. In the dingy hospital, a teenager with leprosy screams as a nurse disinfects his diseased flesh. A young soldier with empty eyes lies motionless as his amputated leg bleeds steadily into a blue bucket. But they, at least, are alive. In the fiercest fighting here in 1993 and 1994, 30,000 people were killed in street battles that spilled out from Avenida Joaquim Kapango. So many died in the hail of falling mortars and machine-gun fire that bodies were buried where they fell, in alleys, parks, backyards, basements. But in a town where thousands are hungry and homeless, the dead are no longer sacred. Grave robbers chip away at the walls of the municipal cemetery. They plunder coffins and drag away precious headstones. ""People used to respect the dead,"" said Francisco Cavamba, 60, a grizzled man who has been burying bodies for 30 years. ""These days, people need bricks and stones to rebuild houses."" Building supplies are flown in on cargo planes at exorbitant prices. That means there are too few bricks on the market, said Mr. Cavamba, staring at the rows of desecrated graves. ""And there are so many, so many dead."" People are still dying. At first, the fighting was fueled by the cold war. The Russians and Cubans backed Mr. dos Santos and his Marxist party, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola. The United States and the apartheid rulers of South Africa supported the rebels, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, known as Unita, led by Jonas Savimbi. When the cold war ended, Mr. Savimbi sold the country's abundant diamonds to equip his army. He returned to war in 1998, but government soldiers armed with the profits of oil sales destroyed much of his war machine last year. Mr. dos Santos has trumpeted the military successes, saying the rebels no longer threaten the government's efforts to rebuild. But recently a bomb exploded outside the police station here, relief workers said. And in the last few months, 40,000 people have poured into the town, fleeing guerrilla attacks and skirmishes between the two sides in nearby villages. In an assessment in November, the United Nations reported that rebel attacks on civilians, banditry and exploding land mines continue to disrupt the country. In some cases, the report says, government soldiers and the police are implicated in the robberies, rapes and forcible relocations of the very people they are supposed to protect. ""It should be noted that while the government claims to have control of over 90 percent of the country, the control that the government exercises does not infer normality,"" the United Nations said in its report. Next year, Angola hopes to export as much as one million barrels of oil a day. And some critics believe that Mr. dos Santos is playing down the country's problems to reduce pressure on the government to invest more in the beleaguered provinces. Hendrik Vaal Neto, the minister of communications, denies such charges. He says the government had no choice in the past but to spend its oil money on weapons. But with the war ebbing, he says the government is moving rapidly to rebuild. ""There has been a lot of suffering since 1975, but right now we are in a better position to solve our people's problems,"" Mr. Neto said in an interview earlier this year. ""There are already many positive changes,"" he said. ""Some people do not want to recognize that. If you give the government two or three years, you will see the government directing even more finances to social problems."" When there is electricity, Mr. Capitango hears those promises revived on the grainy newscasts on his black-and-white television. And most mornings, he pedals his black bicycle to church and asks God to help the government keep its word. ""My father, he encouraged me to believe,"" said Mr. Capitango, 51, his brown eyes wistful with the memory of it, as he invited a stranger into his dim parlor on another afternoon without power. ""He told me there were many wars in the past and that things would change,"" he said. ""The world wars ended. This, too, would end. But my father, he was captured and killed by Unita. ""Now, I talk to my children,"" said Mr. Capitango, sighing. ""I tell them one day the war will finish. But the situation is worse all the time. And I am getting old.""  http://www.nytimes.com Map of Angola highlights Kuito: In Kuito, a broken provincial capital, modernity is just a memory.

Today, Ghana is a welcome African example of legitimate democracy and successful economic reform. In an unusually peaceful transfer of power, a civilian government that grew out of a military regime has accepted an election defeat and surrendered power to the opposition. John Kufuor, an Oxford-trained lawyer and businessman, and the leader of Ghana's opposition New Patriotic Party, was sworn in as president yesterday. He defeated John Atta Mills, the incumbent vice president, in an election widely viewed as free and fair. President Jerry Rawlings, the charismatic former flight lieutenant who has dominated Ghana for nearly 20 years, stepped down after reaching a constitutional two-term limit as elected president. Few would have predicted this turn of events when Mr. Rawlings seized power in a coup in 1981. At the time Ghana was a wreck and millions of people had left the country in search of work. In the two decades since, in close cooperation with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Ghana emerged as a model for free-market innovations in Africa, and now spends five times as much on education and health as on its military. Ghana still faces formidable challenges -- continued corruption, low prices for its main exports, cocoa and gold, and high prices for imported oil. Moreover, Ghana is located in the heart of one of Africa's least stable regions, with nearby Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea consumed by war and smuggling and Ivory Coast in decline. Mr. Rawlings is not the only West African leader to surrender power in the past year. In Senegal last March, President Abdou Diouf, who had held power for 20 years, graciously bowed out after losing an election to the opposition leader Abdoulaye Wade.  Together these two countries have shown that not all the news of Africa need be bad. The key to success in Ghana has been creative and enlightened cooperation between international lenders and local officials, combined with Mr. Rawlings's shrewd effort to tame the military and redirect it away from politics. Nigeria, the region's powerhouse, which is now making its own difficult transition from military rule to democracy, can learn from Ghana's achievement. Mr. Kufuor has said he will introduce a South African-style truth commission to investigate Ghana's violent political past. There are risks in probing deeply into past political crimes. But some form of public accounting for the criminal abuse of power can be a deterrent to future crimes, and thus a source of stability."14-Jan-01,ANGOLA (99%); UNITED STATES (96%); AFRICA (92%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%),"EIGHT years ago, the United States established its first embassy in Angola's crumbling capital, Luanda, and erected a small bronze monument to mark the occasion. Coming after nearly a decade of cold war hostilities, the modest gesture ushered in an extraordinary new relationship. Today, the United States, which was spending some $60 million annually to arm Angola's rebel group, known as Unita, in the late 1980's, is the Angolan government's most powerful ally and the country's biggest investor. And Angola is America's eighth largest supplier of oil. Instead of bankrolling rebel tanks and AK-47's, Americans now spend millions of dollars on aid intended to relieve suffering -- and on the government's vast offshore oil fields. Africa watchers say the attention, particularly to the oil sector, is likely to continue under the Bush administration as oil prices rise and demand for energy surges. Vice President-elect Dick Cheney ran the Halliburton Company, a multinational energy corporation. Condoleezza Rice, the pick for national security adviser, sat on the board of the Chevron Corporation. Both oil companies have significant interests in Angola. So why aren't the Angolans cheering? The restive population is beginning to wonder how much the public has actually benefited from one of the most intense relationships between a sub-Saharan African nation and the world's remaining superpower. The answer, unfortunately, is not very much. Sixteen years after the United States began supplying annual military aid to the rebels (it agreed to end it in 1991 with the withdrawal of Cuban support for the government), most Angolans still live in desperate poverty in a country plagued by corruption, human rights violations and seemingly endless civil war. In recent months, some human rights activists have praised the United States and the International Monetary Fund for quietly pressing the Angolan government to reduce poverty, to repair shattered infrastructure, to rescue the collapsing health and school systems and to respect press freedoms. For the first time, the government has also agreed to allow outside auditors to examine how it spends its enormous oil revenues, which critics allege have often ended up lining officials' pockets. If the government keeps its commitments, it may actually have a shot at winning low-interest loans from the I.M.F. But in Angola, broken promises are as plentiful as the country's vast offshore oil reserves. And America's choice of quiet diplomacy instead of sharp, public condemnation of corruption and human rights abuses has prompted priests, journalists and academics to argue that American officials are as blinded by economic interests today as they once were by the cold war. And so, while other African countries cry out for Western investment and attention, some Angolans are warning that such attention is not always a blessing. ""The Angolan government and Unita have benefited from the relationship with the United States, but the Angolan people have yet to benefit,"" said Rafael Marques, a prominent Angolan human rights activist and journalist who was jailed for criticizing the government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, and whose passport was confiscated last month when he tried to attend a conference in South Africa. On a policy level, however, much has changed. And in many ways, the changing relationship with Angola reflects how dramatically American policy toward Africa has shifted since the end of the cold war. In 1985, when the Soviet Union and the United States were waging proxy battles across sub-Saharan Africa, Sudan, Somalia and Liberia topped the list of America's direct aid recipients. None had a democratic government. Today the leading recipients are all democracies -- Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda. The Angolan rebels, led by Jonas Savimbi, who abandoned two peace accords in 10 years, are pariahs. And in official statements last year, the State Department made a point of prodding Angola toward democracy, criticizing its government for arresting and trying outspoken writers like Mr. Marques. BUT even architects of America's Africa policy find it hard to say exactly how American engagement with Angola has benefited ordinary people in recent years. ""The question of: Have Angolans benefited at all from the last seven years in the process that's unfolded -- that's a hard question,"" said J. Stephen Morrison, who left the State Department's policy planning staff last year after four years of working on Africa policy. ""I don't think there's hard and fast proof that it has paid off yet,"" said Mr. Morrison, who directs the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""I think what we've done in the past few years is a defensible approach in an exceptionally difficult situation. We will only know in time whether this kind of engagement can deliver results."" Mr. Morrison says America's oil interests in Angola do not play a primary role in policy making. But there is no doubt that the United States will become increasingly dependent on West Africa for energy. In a December report, the Central Intelligence Agency predicted that by 2015 North America will import 25 percent of its oil from West Africa (up from 16 percent now), but that it was unlikely that the oil riches would benefit the people of West Africa. ""The pattern of oil wealth fostering corruption rather than economic development will continue,"" the C.I.A. report said."28-Feb-01,COTE D'IVOIRE (97%); UNITED STATES (96%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (72%),"-- The United States today strongly condemned human rights abuses in this once peaceful and prosperous nation, saying the civilian government of President Laurent Gbagbo had done little to rein in human rights violations by state security forces that were rampant under the military regime it replaced. U.S. Ambassador George Mu, in an unusual news conference to discuss the State Department's annual human rights report, said the United States was concerned about Ivory Coast's human rights situation, ""which has deteriorated steadily and appears to us to be continuing with no end in sight."" Mu said state security forces were committing rights violations with impunity. He mentioned extrajudicial killings, arbitrary and illegal detentions, torture, extortion, and harassment of foreigners, who make up almost a third of the population. Gbagbo, the country's elected leader, has failed to halt the abuses by security forces, especially the paramilitary gendarmerie, according to the U.S. report, as well as recent reports by Human Rights Watch and the Ivorian Human Rights League. Until recently, this West African nation was widely regarded as a model of economic stability and racial harmony and had largely escaped the worst of the widespread malfeasance common to its neighbors. But Ivory Coast has suffered a steady decline over the past 18 months. The military seized power in December 1999, anti-foreigner sentiment has grown, and repeated coup attempts and continuing political instability have led scores of businesses to shut down or relocate. Harassment of businessmen and extortion rackets run by security forces, coupled with the growing number of police roadblocks where bribes are constantly demanded, also have driven businesses away. Government spokesmen did not return telephone calls seeking comment. But on Monday, the government, after a long cabinet meeting, said it was creating an elite police group to crack down on extortion, political violence and unlawful roadblocks. The European Union, United States and such international lending agencies as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have all made improving the human rights situation a condition of renewing aid, which was suspended after the 1999 coup. This message was hammered home to Prime Minister Affi N'Guessan during a recent visit to Europe and will be reinforced during his visit this week to the United States to meet officials of the Bush administration and international lending agencies, according to diplomatic sources. Gbagbo took power following elections last October in which most major candidates were banned from participating by the ruling military, led by Gen. Robert Guei. Gbagbo, a longtime socialist opposition leader, defeated Guei in the voting and called his followers into the street to drive the military out when Guei refused to step down. Gbagbo was aided by the gendarmerie. Hundreds of people were killed in the October street fighting. A Human Rights Watch briefing paper released in December said there was ""overwhelming evidence of state-sponsored human rights violations, with a clear ethnic and religious focus"" in the October violence. Muslims and supporters of the opposition Rally of Republicans -- a party based in the mostly Muslim northern region -- bore the brunt of the attacks, Human Rights Watch said. Many more died during political violence in December that was sparked by Gbagbo's decision to ban a leading Rally of Republicans candidate from legislative elections. The State Department report, along with other human rights reports, noted that, despite the government's pledge to investigate a massacre in October of 57 people, mostly young Muslim men, no results of any investigation have been issued and no one has been punished. The State Department report said security forces ""regularly beat"" those detained, forced them to drink urine or blood and eat excrement."21-Mar-01,NIGERIA (97%); AFRICA (79%),"When Nigeria threw off military rule and restored democracy in 1999, the country's newly elected leaders immediately set their sights on eliminating the worst aspects of the old regime. They ended long lines at gasoline stations. They set about shoring up the country's crumbling infrastructure. They went to war on corruption and tried to balance the books. Two years later, the gas lines are back. The infrastructure is still a shambles. The latest government budget includes $ 330 million for a national soccer stadium -- more than will be spent on health or education. And Nigerians are wondering why the promising future is starting to look so much like the dreary past. When he took office in May 1999, ending 16 years of corrupt and brutal military rule, President Olusegun Obasanjo, a retired general, raised hopes at home and abroad that he would be able to make the tough choices necessary to revive the economy of Africa's most populous nation. He immediately made funds available to purchase fuel and ended the shortages that, even though Nigeria produces 2 million barrels of oil a day, had forced motorists to wait in long lines and led to massive blackouts, hampering the economy and impeding foreign investment. But those hopes have faded. Gasoline lines have reappeared in recent weeks, and the electricity supply is dwindling, largely because politicians and former military leaders are siphoning off the fuel to sell at a 400 percent markup on the black market, according to diplomats, government officials and irate motorists. At the same time, Obasanjo not only included the new stadium in his latest budget but also allocated tens of millions of dollars for new jets for himself, the vice president and other senior government officials, and for new office furniture for the government. The planned expenditures contrast sharply with Obasanjo's rhetoric during his first two years in office, much of which was spent globe-trotting to seek relief from Nigeria's $ 35 billion foreign debt while promising austerity and poverty reduction at home. Diplomats and politicians here say Obasanjo and other political leaders are gearing up for elections in 2003. In their efforts to cement political alliances and win over various constituencies, they are allowing this nation of 120 million to slip back to the edge of economic collapse in a budget-busting binge characterized by a refusal to make potentially costly decisions on halting corruption and privatizing the vast, inefficient state-run economy. ""This is what happens when you start running for reelection two years early: You can't make the tough choices,"" said a diplomat who follows economics. ""You try to give everyone something. It stinks politically."" Even Obasanjo's critics acknowledge that he inherited an enormous task, taking office with an empty treasury, billions of dollars of debt and an infrastructure that had suffered from decades of neglect. But there is growing concern at home and abroad that he is committing many of the same mistakes that helped Nigeria's military justify its last takeover, in 1983. While few say that the now discredited and demoralized military poses a threat to democracy, there is concern that a return to ostentatious government spending and the resulting lack of economic growth will fan the regional, ethnic and religious rivalries that constantly test the strength of the Nigerian federation. ""People generally are disgusted,"" said Tunji Braithwaite, a lawyer and former presidential candidate known for his opposition to the military. ""Things like the stadium are absolutely a white elephant, with no rational thinking. Corruption is surging, not declining. It is criminal to have gas lines in this country, yet they are growing worse. ""It is hard to see where this is going to end."" Nigeria's immense population and prodigious oil production ensure that concern about the country's future extends far beyond its borders. The United States views Nigeria as a vital ally in West Africa, a region beset by conflict in nearby Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea and political instability in Ivory Coast, U.S. officials said. And while the Bush administration has been largely silent on policy toward Africa, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell told the House International Relations Committee this month that ""I think we can be sort of proud now as to the start that President Obasanjo has made putting his country back on the right path."" But a State Department report released this month said Nigeria's economy is ""static, with growth still impeded by grossly inadequate infrastructure, endemic corruption and general economic mismanagement. The country's ports, roads, water and power infrastructure are collapsing."" What economists, analysts and diplomats find especially worrisome is that the government has made so little progress in setting up a viable economic program at a time when oil prices have skyrocketed on the world market, providing millions of dollars in extra revenue. ""The pervasive corruption so cripples the system it makes it impossible for any solution or formula to work,"" said Mofia Akobo, a former oil minister who now works as an environmentalist. ""What is worse is that Obasanjo appears to be totally unable to deal with the situation. It is a very tricky and dangerous situation for the country."" Obasanjo recently joked that the fuel supply was ""jinxed"" and said he could do little to solve the shortages because the legislature had blocked all moves to deregulate the heavily subsidized price of gasoline, making smuggling inside and outside the country extremely profitable. Jackson Gaius-Obaseki, director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp., said in a report released this week that the fuel crisis was caused by an increase in demand for gasoline coupled with the fact that the nation's four refineries, hobbled by lack of maintenance, were operating at only 31 percent of capacity. But gasoline is readily available all over the country. Busy intersections and gas stations are lined with young men openly displaying five-gallon plastic jugs full of fuel -- available for four times the official price of 80 cents a gallon. While most gas stations receive a limited amount of fuel to sell at the official price, tankers arrive at night and unload much larger quantities that are then sold on the black market, according to gasoline sellers. That is part of what makes people such as Emanuel Seuger so bitter. Waiting in a gasoline line that stretched a least a mile in the southern city of Port Harcourt, Seuger said he blamed the government for the problems. ""I wait in line every day for at least two hours. Sometimes I lose the whole day or spend the night in line,"" he said, sitting in the cab of his pickup truck, inching ahead one car length every few minutes. ""I blame the government for not being able to fix the problem. We have two refineries in Port Harcourt. How can we not have gasoline? I feel like I'm trapped in hell."" [Planned weeklong protests against a proposed 50 percent increase in gas prices started yesterday in some of Nigeria's 36 states, and a major rally is planned today in Lagos, the Reuters news agency reported.] As for the budget's soccer stadium, Obasanjo has defended building a world-class facility for the nation's premier sport as necessary for the country to host international games. And he has argued that Nigeria's aging fleet of official aircraft endangers the lives of those they transport. But economists and international analysts here say the new budget is not only wasteful, it jeopardizes a vital $ 1 billion emergency standby loan authorized by the International Monetary Fund and seen as crucial to easing Nigeria's constant liquidity crisis. This is because the budget spends far more on projects such as the stadium than the government agreed to when it negotiated the loan. ""We have an economy that has almost reached its capacity for inefficiency,"" said one diplomat. ""On a positive note, things can't get much worse. But there is nothing I can point to that this government has done to make things better."""22-Apr-01,ANGOLA (97%); AFRICA (96%); UNITED STATES (93%); NETHERLANDS (79%); ZAMBIA (79%); PORTUGAL (79%); EUROPE (79%); BENELUX (79%); NIGERIA (79%); LUXEMBOURG (70%); BELGIUM (70%),"THIS ghost of a bustling industrial town is just over 30 miles from the safety of the capital, Luanda, a fearfully long distance in a country at war for decades, where guerrilla attacks skirt the cities with unsettling regularity. The road to the capital is off limits from dusk to dawn. A few weeks ago, rebels attacked the nearby town of Calomboloca. killing some residents and abducting others. And earlier in neighboring Catete, at least four people were killed in a rebel attack. So the idea that government soldiers would be guarding the new Coca-Cola bottling plant here should not be surprising, and certainly not as startling as the idea that Coca-Cola would be in Angola at all. This is, after all, a corner of the world unlike almost any other where Coca-Cola, the world's leading soft-drink purveyor, has operations. Yet the company is here, re-establishing itself in a country it quit 26 years ago. Since then, Coke, Sprite and Fanta soft drinks in Angola have come from Europe and from neighboring nations like Zambia. The company's new $33 million plant on the banks of the Cuanza River has been up and running for a little more than a year. Another plant, costing nearly $6 million, is to open in a few months in the southern part of the country. The investment, already more than $40 million, is big by African standards. Only the oil industry, with billions of dollars in investments, and to a lesser extent the mining industry are pouring more money, much of it American, into Angola. The country's coastal seabed is bursting with oil, and pockets of its interior are teeming with diamonds. In recent years, among African countries, only Nigeria and South Africa have rivaled Angola for direct American investment. Yet Coke's experience shows that a single large investment often has only modest benefits in a country like Angola. Unless the government decides to shift much of its oil earnings into solving extensive social problems, the country will need dozens, if not hundreds, of investments like it. And the challenges for Coke show just how just how hard it will be to persuade other investors that the risk is worthwhile. Even Coke, a multinational corporation, has hit many obstacles opening and operating a business in a country where civil war has raged for years and where corruption is institutionalized. There is, of course, the curfew, around which employees' workdays and delivery truck departures must be scheduled. Most of the roads between cities, -- roads that should carry Coke to the far corners of the country -- are considered too dangerous to travel day or night; they are vulnerable to rebel ambushes and land mines. As a result, the local bottling company, according to its own estimates, can reach only 3.2 million of the 5 million people in the nine provinces covered by its franchise. And then there is Angola's reputation as a bureaucratic black hole, where bribery is the surest and sometimes the only way of clearing a police checkpoint, obtaining a construction permit or moving supplies through customs. SOME people are quite surprised that the company has invested here at all,"" said Islay Rhind, managing director of Coca-Cola Bottling (Luanda), the joint venture established by Coca-Cola, the Angolan government and South African Breweries. Mr. Rhind, a Scottish Coca-Cola veteran who has served all over Africa, from Botswana to Kenya to Nigeria, is more than willing to enumerate the difficulties of doing business here -- but he makes it clear that he considers none of them insurmountable. ""We bring with us a very rigid code of conduct, which isn't necessarily very popular in a place like Angola, which has this reputation for corruption,"" Mr. Rhind said. ""But that's who we are, that's what we are, that's the way we do business."" Sticking to such policies was simple, he said; explaining them was harder. ""It was very difficult to get people to understand that that's what we do and why,"" he said. ""We don't pay bribes. We don't take bribes. It's a hard road, but that's the way it is."" As difficult and as uncomfortable as fending off demands for bribes may be at the outset, he said, it ultimately makes business easier. ""Once the community knows who you are, what you are, it ceases to become an issue,"" he said. ""Everyone knows we won't pay to have our telephones reconnected, we won't pay policemen to let our trucks through, so we don't have to bribe anybody."" Having operated in sub-Saharan Africa since 1938, Coca-Cola has learned to live with the continent's rough edges. ""There will always be challenges,"" Robert Lindsay, a vice president of Coca-Cola's Africa Group, said in a telephone interview from the company's headquarters in Atlanta, where he was attending meetings. ""But we as a business want to be there, and we will do our damnedest to be there as long as we can without putting our people or our business in danger."" Coca-Cola continued to sell and promote its products in South Africa during the apartheid era, when its archrival, Pepsi, pulled out, although Coke did sell off its South African bottling interests and shift syrup production to neighboring Swaziland. As a result, Coca-Cola was able to consolidate its hold on South Africa, which today is its biggest African market and its hub in the region. With its return to Angola, Coca-Cola now does business in nearly all of Africa, with about 150 bottling operations on the continent. Only Libya and Sudan, which are officially off limits to American companies, have no Coca-Cola operations. Some countries where the risks of doing business are high, like Somalia and Liberia, have distribution networks but no local production operations. Other conflict areas, like Burundi, Congo and now Angola, have local distribution and production. Sometimes, as in Burundi, a beer brewer like Heineken, in a joint venture with Coca-Cola, handles the production. Elsewhere, as in Angola, the production is at a Coca-Cola plant jointly owned by the company and partners like the government and local breweries. There is money to be made. ""If you look at our annual report, you will see we are profitable in Africa,"" Mr. Lindsay said. ""It's a challenging business, but it's still a profitable business and that's why we are still there."" Coca-Cola's results for 2000 show that the company does make money in Africa -- although it is far more profitable elsewhere. The company's operations in Africa and the Middle East accounted for 2 percent of its $3.7 billion in operating profit last year, while the region comprising Europe and parts of Eurasia accounted for 30 percent, North America 29 percent, the Asia-Pacific region 20 percent and Latin America 19 percent. IT is Africa's potential for sales and profits, however, that intrigues Coca-Cola. The company's case volume, a measure of growth in the beverage industry, expanded by 10 percent in Africa in the first quarter, versus a year earlier. That compares with marginal increases in more developed markets in the Americas and Europe. ""Our core business has the potential for significant expansion,"" said Douglas N. Daft, the chairman and chief executive, in announcing the company's first-quarter results last week. ""People outside the United States drink less than one serving of carbonated soft drinks a week. Within the U.S., consumers drink more than one serving a day."" In that context, Coca-Cola's foray into African countries like Angola makes sense. Over the last few years -- the last one in particular -- Angola has undergone considerable changes that have made it a less hostile place to run a business. While the war still appears to be far from an end, government forces have won significant gains, creating a measure of security around the cities where international companies operate. The government has agreed to work with the International Monetary Fund on economic reforms and to allow limited auditing of the government-controlled oil sector. Such changes have created enough stability for Coca-Cola, if not many other companies. But a few of them are trying. One is Seaboard Commodity Trading and Milling, part of the Seaboard Corporation of Shawnee Mission, Kan. The company, an agricultural products concern that also does business in Congo, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, came to Angola a couple of years ago. It has invested about $4.5 million rehabilitating an old wheat mill, and began production a month ago. Another is Delta Cafes of Lisbon, which has been rebuilding one of the country's principal coffee factories; the plant had been shuttered for 15 years. Angola was once one of the world's top five coffee growers, but that industry, along with many others, succumbed to the war. Now it ranks 28th in global production, Earlier in the planning stages is Citibank, the banking unit of Citigroup, which is weighing its options. It has had a small staff in the country, in what is known as a representative office, for about two years, according to Marcus Andrade, the regional managing director. The bank hopes to open a commercial bank here eventually, he said. That step, if taken, would provide more banking options for major international corporations, which are now served almost exclusively by Portuguese banks. But Mr. Andrade says Citibank's plans depend on the potential for growth and stability in the country. Coca-Cola operated plants here under colonial rule, but pulled out after independence from Portugal in 1975 gave way to the civil war that continues today. For more than a decade after the pullout, nearly all Coca-Cola products in Angola arrived under loose import arrangements with foreign partners, primarily in Europe. (A tiny, independently owned plant in the central city of Huambo never closed completely, but its production has been minuscule and erratic because of difficulty in obtaining supplies.) By the early 1990's, demand was growing. Coca-Cola decided in 1992 to take a small step back into the Angolan market, arranging to oversee the imports. But six years would pass before the company took the bigger step of re-establishing shop in the country. A couple of years after that, its bottles began rolling off the production lines of the freshly scrubbed, red-trimmed plant here. Now flatbed trucks carrying stacks of bottle-filled crates to distribution centers are a common sight on the road between Bom Jesus and Luanda. IN the streets of the capital, bright-red umbrellas emblazoned with the Coca-Cola logo are everywhere, hoisted by young men peddling bottles of Coke, Fanta and Sprite from big red coolers. In shops in and around the capital, new refrigerators supplied by Coca-Cola to 1,200 retail outlets keep sodas cold. And above big thoroughfares, freshly posted Coca-Cola billboards urge Angolans to ""Curte o Teu Mundo,"" or ""Enjoy Your World."" The 12-ounce bottles sell for about 8 new kwanza, or around 40 cents at current exchange rates, well below prices in the United States and not prohibitively expensive in Angola. ""The majority of people can afford it,"" said Dade Alvaro, 20, who sells sodas on Rua N'Gola Kiluange, down the street from Coca-Cola's local headquarters. Working from about 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., six days a week, he sells about five cases a day and takes home about $8 a day. It is not much, but it helps him pay his share of the rent while he works at becoming a mechanic. ""For the moment, it's good. I'm happy,"" he said. Coca-Cola's attempt to increase its Angolan business partly reflects an African expansion effort begun in 1997 by M. Douglas Ivester, then the company's chairman and chief executive. Last year, 7 percent of Coca-Cola's 17.1 billion cases were sold in Africa, up from 5 percent in each of the previous three years. Over the last five years, the company has poured about $600 million into Africa, Mr. Lindsay said. In fact, Coca-Cola's business success in Africa has been one of the few bright spots in its recent history, known more for episodes like an embarrassing and costly contamination scare in Europe a few years ago and accusations of racial discrimination against its black employees in the United States. Almost a year ago, the company pledged $1 billion over five years to programs aimed at strengthening partnerships with businesses owned by minorities and women. And a settlement for the roughly 2,200 plaintiffs in a class action against the company could be approved in the next few months -- another step in the company's efforts to rebuild its relationship with blacks. Coca-Cola says its efforts in Africa, whatever effect they may have on its image at home, are about business. ""We're certainly aware that what we do in Africa has a residual effect and is of interest to many people, including the African-American community here,"" said Ben Deutsch, a Coca-Cola spokesman in Atlanta. ""But the bottom line is, our investment there is driven by our desire to grow our business in Africa."" Bottling as close as possible to customers is an important part of that strategy, Mr. Lindsay said. ""The reason is that the core of our business is affordability,"" he added, ""and when you have to transport the product into the country, it makes it much more expensive."" That is why Coca-Cola's Africa operation does not bottle beverages in just the handful of countries that are, comparatively speaking, politically stable, like South Africa, Senegal, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. And it is why Coca-Cola ended up back in Angola. Among African nations, Angola ranks 12th in total sales of Coke, just after Mozambique and Ghana and just ahead of Uganda and Namibia. But while establishing a local presence here was almost certainly the highest hurdle, others remain. One is the black market that supplies canned Coca-Cola products. By evading import duties and shipping costs, black-market dealers undercut local bottlers. Such problems are not unexpected and not entirely avoidable in a place like Angola, Mr. Rhind said. But with its 45 percent stake in the company, the Angolan government has great interest in seeing the venture flourish, and Coca-Cola is confident that the authorities are doing what they can to combat duty evasion and product dumping. ""I don't think it will disappear entirely, forever,"" Mr. Rhind said. ""I don't believe that for one instant, but that's just how it is. You have to handle that."" Operations in Angola have been hampered by a shortage of workers with skills in areas like accounting and advanced mechanics, as well as by difficulties in obtaining production supplies. Given the skills shortage, initial training and recruiting costs were high and the company's expectations for its workers were low, compared with other countries, Mr. Rhind said. But the company has been encouraged by the swift improvement. ""We budgeted to have fairly low efficiencies at our plant to start off with, which is normal in any country in the world,"" Mr. Rhind said, ""and I guess we were both racial and paternalistic in assuming that that would continue for longer than one normally would expect. ""In fact, the opposite is the case,"" he added. ""Our employees picked up the efficiencies and qualities very quickly, much more quickly than we would have expected."" When it opened the plant, the company said it expected to produce about five million cases a year. Within a few months, the production rate increased to eight million cases a year. It is now at 14 million a year. FROM the huge vats where white sugar is mixed into water to the deafening roar of the filling machines, about 80 people work in production. Another 60 or so are in administrative and support jobs. For many Angolan employees, this is the first steady, formal work they have had in a long time, maybe their lifetimes. That applies even to some of the handful who have management jobs, most of which are held by foreigners. Sonia Bastos is an Angolan who studied chemistry in France and came back, she said, to find a way to contribute to her country. Unfortunately, she said, in a place with virtually no industry, she had only two choices: a low-paying government job or a well-paying oil-industry job that would keep her away for weeks at a time on a rig full of men. So she waited, biding her time working as a translator and a secretary. Now she is a supervisor in the plant's quality control lab. ""We have to start at the beginning,"" she said of her country, ""and it's very important to be part of that."" THE shortages of local supplies -- and the resulting high costs -- are evident on a walk around the plant floor. In one corner are stacks, at least 15 feet high, of boxes containing new Coca-Cola bottles. The boxes are stamped ""Al Tajir Glass,"" referring in English and Arabic to the company in the United Arab Emirates that makes the bottles. Near the purification system that pumps out water from the Cuanza River are 220 metric tons of sugar, a sizable stockpile even for a business that trades in sweetness. Stacked in row after row of 2,200-pound containers, the sugar was sent by ship from South Africa to Angola, a country that once had a fine sugar industry. The huge stockpiles of sugar and other supplies are needed because deliveries here are erratic -- often held up in delays at the port. According to Harvard's 2000-2001 Africa Competitiveness Report, the average time needed for imports to clear customs in Angola was 49 days, compared with 20 in Kenya, 9 in South Africa, 7 in Botswana and 5 in Morocco. The costs of such a distorted supply chain are high for Coca-Cola, and for the country. The company has created factory and office jobs for just over 300 people, and hundreds more now sell sodas on the street. But Angola's economy has not yet added many of the jobs in services and in supply manufacturing that such an investment ordinarily spawns. WITH an end to the war elusive, Coca-Cola and the plant's potential spinoffs account for much of what little hope the country has for economic gains. The booming oil industry, set largely off the shores of the country and dependent on skilled workers scarcely found here, has done almost nothing to end the suffering of Angola's 12.9 million people. Of every 100 babies born in Angola, 19 die before their first birthday; the overall life expectancy is about 38 years. More than a million people, many of them driven from their land by the fighting, are fed by the World Food Program of the United Nations. Next door to the warehouse, a small local company began operations last month, molding the bright red Coca-Cola crates used to transport the bottles. It is exactly the sort of spinoff that Angola needs. The crates, however, are used over and over, even more than the bottles. So demand for crates is tiny; it supports just eight jobs. Still, Angola's advocates hope that such ventures are a start -- and a signal that the country is changing and improving as an investment destination, even as the war persists. ""The important thing is the trend line,"" said Paul Hare, executive director of the U.S.-Angola Chamber of Commerce, who was President Clinton's special envoy to the Angola peace negotiations. ""The way the country is going and the prospect of investing and making money are quite different from what it would have been two years ago."""4-May-01,GHANA (97%); UNITED STATES (93%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%),"The good news from Ghana, the West African state from which so many black Americans trace their roots, is that after decades of political mismanagement it is finally following the first rule of holes. The first rule of holes states: ""When you're in a hole, stop digging."" Having had its first-ever peaceful, democratic transition from one elected government to another last December, Ghana's new president, J. A. Kufuor, has a clear mandate to stop digging. Mr. Kufuor was elected by a solid majority by calling for improved governance, an end to official corruption and a renewed effort to expand trade and attract foreign investment. That's the good news. The bad news is: The hole Ghana has dug itself into is really, really deep. Half of Ghana's government budget goes to pay just the interest on its domestic and foreign debts, accumulated over years of idiotic African Socialism, plunder by leaders and weak governance, compounded by poor oversight by the I.M.F. and World Bank. ""The problem for us,"" President Kufuor said in an interview at his home, ""is that you feel like you're in a hole, and you want to get out, and you hear all these noises and all this activity coming from the top of the hole. It leaves you feeling that everyone up there is busy and active and you feel very much alone. I want to feel that there is someone out there with some humanism to stretch back to me and help me out."" What is encouraging about Ghana is that the impulse for reform here was driven by the people below, not just the pols above. What worries Ghanaians, though, is that after so many years in the third world they may not be able to compete in the Fast World. I gave a talk at the University of Ghana, and afterward one student asked me: ""Will the world have empathy for us?"" -- as Ghana tries to go down this new path. ""No,"" I said, ""the world will have no empathy for you, but that's not what you want anyway! You want to appeal to greed. You want to create a sense of opportunity here that will attract wealthy Ghanaians to bring their money back home and create jobs. You want investment, not pity."" The dependency culture here is so deep, though, this logic is very new. Then another student asked: If it's true that in the age of globalization the big don't eat the small but the fast will eat the slow, what is Ghana to do? ""We're naturally slow here,"" he said. ""We eat slow. We talk slow. We sing slow. We like things slow. How will we compete in this world?"" Direction is more important than speed, I argued. Ghana has been on the wrong road for so long its per-capita income is now $1 a day. It needs to get on the right road and go at any pace it can. Ghana is rich in human and natural resources. What it has lacked are good fundamentals: institutions, decent schools and legal frameworks to get the most out of those resources. The secret for success in globalization is all about building good fundamentals -- not modems or bandwidth. ""The lack of good governance is the bane of Africa,"" said Papa Owusu-Ankomah, deputy majority leader of the Ghanaian Parliament. ""Without strong institutions we can't check abuses of power, and that has been the source of all our problems."" But generating institutions is not easy. Historically there are two ways: One is the way America got them -- through evolution: 200 years of slowly evolving the habits and laws to govern a modern society. The other way is how India or postwar Germany and Japan got them -- through imperialism: someone comes from abroad and imposes democratic structures until they take root. The problem for Ghana, and the rest of Africa, is that it is too early for evolution -- that takes decades -- and it is too late for imperialism. It will have to find the energy from within. Mr. Kufuor's election signals that Ghanaians want to try. Mr. Kufuor says he intends to try. The Bush team should go out of its way to help Ghana -- now -- with conditional aid. That is, aid, and debt relief, tied to the building of real institutions. The dawns are always spectacular on the vast African continent, but false dawns abound here as well. Just look at Nigeria and South Africa, whose democratically elected leaders are slowly sinking away. Ghana now offers the best chance to establish an African model for free-market democracy. Here comes the sun. Let's hope it's really rising, and if it is, let's do our part to keep it up there."20-May-01,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (90%); AFRICA (78%)","Living on the Brink of Disaster in Mobutu's Congo By Michela Wrong HarperCollins. 338 pp. $ 26 The British journalist Michela Wrong takes the title of this chillingly amusing cautionary tale from Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, near the end of which the dying white station manager, Mr. Kurtz, cries out against ""the horror, the horror."" It is, as Wrong says, ""one of the great misquotations of all time,"" commonly misinterpreted as a protest against black Africa's ""supposed predisposition to violence."" Wrong gets it right: ""When Kurtz raves against 'the horror, the horror,' he is . . . registering in a final lucid moment just how far he has fallen from grace. The 'darkness' of the book's title refers to the monstrous passions at the core of the human soul, lying ready to emerge when man's better instincts are suspended. . . . Conrad was more preoccupied with rotten Western values, the white man's inhumanity to the black man, than, as is almost always assumed today, black savagery."" Wrong uses Conrad's theme in her study of the calamitous three-decade reign of Mobutu Sese Seko in Congo -- which Mobutu renamed Zaire -- to say that ""no man is a caricature, no individual can alone bear responsibility for a nation's collapse."" What happened in Zaire ""had its roots in a history of extraordinary outside interference, as basic in motivation as it was elevated in rhetoric."" She is wholly unsentimental about Mobutu, whom she calls ""brutal, ruthless and greedy,"" a ""neighborhood thug,"" but she also insists that ""if Mobutu traced a Kurtz-like trajectory from high ideals to febrile corruption, he did not pursue that itinerary alone, or unaided."" The story of Congo between Mobutu's rise to power in 1965 and his involuntary departure 32 years later is at once simple and familiar, yet unimaginably complicated, ambiguous and mysterious. On the one hand, it is a tale of a charming, stylish, intelligent, manipulative man who rose from unlikely origins, gained control of his government by unscrupulous means and bled its treasury dry; it is a tale that has been told many times, in many settings and with many casts of characters, and it gets no prettier with each retelling. On the other hand, it is a hugely intricate tapestry in which past and present are woven together in patterns that sometimes prove impenetrable; a tale involving so many people, organizations and acronyms that sheer bewilderment is the only honest way to respond; and a tale upon which it is impossible, in most respects if not all, to pronounce final and confident moral judgment. The legacy of Mobutu and his accomplices is stunning: ""Congo's economy has shrunk to the level of 1958, while the population has tripled. Average life expectancy is fifty-two, 80 per cent of the population is employed in 'subsistence activities'; illiteracy is growing; AIDS is rife and such diseases as bubonic plague and sleeping sickness are enjoying a vibrant comeback. By the end of the century the government's annual operating budget for what is potentially one of Africa's richest states was dipping below the daily takings of the US superstore Wal-Mart."" There are many reasons, but it all comes down to this: Mobutu stole Congo blind. Almost as soon as Mobutu took office, Wrong says, he devised the formula that would keep him in power for more than three decades: ""Why kill your enemies . . . when, with a bit of financial encouragement, they would willingly sell their souls?"" Mobutu had his sybaritic side and indulged it lavishly at public expense, ""but money was always a method, an instrument, the most effective of the techniques available when it came to maintaining, extending and preserving his power."" He ran ""a clientilist system that gobbled cash,"" to be blown on bribes and ""gifts"" and makework bureaucratic jobs and luxury automobiles and military hardware. His son, Nzanga, told Wrong: ""He never had the soul of a racketeer. For him money was simply a means to an end, a way of getting what he wanted."" The Mobutu government was a kleptocracy. As real money was gobbled up by Mobutu and his insiders, paper money was printed to keep the cash cow milkable. Inflation, ""which had reached double-digit figures sufficient in themselves to bring down an accountable Western government, suddenly rocketed in 1991 to a mind-boggling 4,130 per cent. . . . and in 1994 came the worst of the worst: inflation ballooned to 9,800 per cent."" The ""system was indeed imploding under the weight of its own eccentricities,"" and by the early 1990s things had gotten so out of hand that rebellion was inevitable. It came in October 1996, with the formation of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire; ""first Rwanda, then Uganda and finally Angola were eventually to join forces with the AFDL in a momentary coalition of regional interests never before witnessed in Africa,"" turning Zaire into ""the terrain on which alien forces worked out ancient grudges, with the locals swept along for the ride."" Mobutu -- who by then was dying of prostate cancer -- was sent into exile with surpassing swiftness, and Laurent Kabila installed in his stead: ""Despite [Mobutu's] departure, there has been no renewal, no change in mentalities. Mobutu ruled thanks to the support of a mono-ethnic security force. So does Kabila. Mobutu plundered the central bank. So does Kabila. Mobutu destroyed the formal economy. Kabila has gone even further, choking off the informal economy. 'Kabila,' as one European politician astutely remarked, 'has simply replaced Mobutu with Mobutuism.' "" Though Mobutu, Kabila and Co. must not in any way be permitted to shrug off the blame for their acts, Wrong correctly places them in the larger context of King Leopold of Belgium, who in the mid-1880s acquired as his very own colony the 905,000-square-mile Congo, which he called ""this magnificent African cake"" and to which he gave the name of Congo Free State. It was a deplorable euphemism. Congo under Leopold's rule ""was an exploitative system premised on forced labor, terror and repression,"" in which Leopold's agents tortured and murdered African natives in order to bend their labor to the king's commercial ambitions. As Wrong sees it, the parallel between Mobutu and Leopold is even stronger than that between Mobutu and Kabila: ""The two men shared more than just a knack for large-scale extortion and lavish spending tastes. Indeed, in money matters, the present echoes the past to an almost uncanny extent. Both leaders were to prove remarkably adept at squeezing loans out of gullible creditors and luring private investors with a taste for adventure to Africa. Both covered their tracks with a system of fraudulent book-keeping. Both indulged in similar stratagems in an attempt to cheat the taxman after their deaths and both, having feathered their own nests, left Congo with a heavy burden of debts to be settled after they quit the scene."" Belgium and its king were scarcely the only ones to exploit Congo for their own gain. France and the United States used it as a tool of Western interests during the Cold War -- the CIA, needless to say, had its hands into just about everything -- and then, once the Cold War ended, abandoned it with scarcely a backward glance. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund played their own questionable roles. ""Instead of the roller-coaster of war, destruction and eventual rebirth,"" Wrong writes, ""the intervention of the US, France and Belgium, of the World Bank and IMF, locked the society into one slow-motion economic collapse. Balked of expression, unable to advance, mindsets froze over sometime in the 1960s, leaving the country's leadership at the turn of the century stuck in an ideological time-warp."" The prospects of awakening it to reality any time soon are not exactly bright. * Jonathan Yardley's e-mail address is yardley@twp.com."27-May-01,KENYA (96%); ZIMBABWE (94%); AFRICA (94%); UNITED STATES (92%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%),"Secretary of State Colin L. Powell met today with Kenya's longtime president, Daniel arap Moi, and urged him to step aside and let a new president be elected next year. That repeated a message General Powell had sent to the president of Zimbabwe earlier on his African tour. General Powell called on Mr. Moi to push through an anti-corruption law in order to re-establish ties with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund; the organizations cut off loans to Kenya four years ago. But Mr. Moi left American officials guessing about his political intentions. Kenyan law calls for elections to be held by December 2002, and Mr. Moi, who is 76 years old and has been in office since 1978, is barred from re-election. Some of his supporters have urged him to change the system and run again, but General Powell suggested he could leave a positive legacy by stepping aside and allowing a new generation to guide the country. After meeting with General Powell today, Mr. Moi spoke cryptically outside the statehouse about General Powell's call for free elections and new leadership. ""I think it is too much always trying to undermine the intelligence of the African people,"" Mr. Moi said dismissively. ""Those who will determine the destiny of Kenya or other countries are the people themselves."" In a speech at a university in Johannesburg the day before, General Powell voiced his belief that some African leaders had clung to power too long. He cited President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, who has headed that country as either president or prime minister for more than two decades. Kenya has been ruled by the Kenya African National Union since its independence from Britain in 1963 and has become in effect a one-party state. Opposition parties are splintered among the country's many tribal groups, and Mr. Moi has used strong-arm tactics to keep rivals at bay. Tribal rivalries have long been an unsettling factor in Kenya's formation as an independent country. General Powell made a point today of meeting with opposition lawmakers such as Mwai Kibaki, a former vice president to Mr. Moi, who has since formed the rival Democratic Party and is regarded as a leading opposition candidate for president. General Powell was also joined in a discussion by Raila Odinga, son of another former vice president, Oginga Odinga. Raila Odinga had been jailed by Mr. Moi for allegedly organizing an opposition movement to topple the government. Some of Mr. Moi's allies have been keeping alive the idea of a another Moi term, leading to much speculation that the president, the son of a herdsman, will cling to the post. Despite his grip on power, Mr. Moi's official biography portrays him as a reluctant stateman who merely filled a leadership void and rebuffed plotters in 1992 who have tried to interrupt his elected leadership. ""Though moves to frustrate and destroy his political career were plotted, he calmly resisted and humbled himself, forgiving those who were after his neck as he assumed power,"" his biography says. A group of Kenyans also sought to press General Powell during his stay here for more compensation for victims of the 1998 bombing of the American Embassy here, which left 224 Kenyans dead and thousands injured. General Powell placed a wreath at a memorial for victims today but he declined to discuss the matter, saying there were lawsuits pending.  URL: http://www.nytimes.com"15-Aug-01,KENYA (96%),"President Daniel arap Moi sought today to restart the flow of international funds to Kenya by striding into the Parliament and personally voting for a measure that would set up an anticorruption authority to investigate official misdeeds. But opposition lawmakers apparently were not impressed by Mr. Moi's show of commitment to fighting graft. Hesitant to hand him a political victory and concerned that the anticorruption body would lack teeth, enough lawmakers voted against the measure to overcome even the personal appeal of Kenya's powerful president. The International Monetary Fund has made creation of the Kenya Anticorruption Authority one of several conditions that the country must meet before it receives continued aid. With its economy in its worst state since independence, Kenya had built more than $300 million of international aid into its operating budget this year, money that might not materialize now. Presidential politics was clearly in the air today. Kenya is to have a presidential election next year in which Mr. Moi, who has held office since 1978, is expected to cede power to a successor. It is a wide open race, and Mr. Moi's Kenya African National Union party is eager to patch up the economy before the vote. It was believed to be the first time a Kenyan president -- there have only been two since the country became independent in 1963 -- has come to Parliament to vote. When he strode into the chamber this afternoon, Mr. Moi was just a regular member of Parliament, required to sit on a bench like all the others and to leave his ceremonial gold and ivory baton outside. ""We did everything we could,"" lamented Albert Ekirapa, Mr. Moi's assistant minister for trade and industry. ""For a president of a country to come and vote in the Parliament shows his commitment."" But others saw Mr. Moi's trip to the Parliament more as a sign that he was desperate for international aid than that he was committed to stamping out the corruption that pervades the country. ""The opposition wants to eliminate corruption seriously, not through gimmicks like the current bill,"" the parliamentary leader of the opposition, Mwai Kibaki of the Democratic Party, said at a news conference after the bill was defeated. With today's defeat, under the parliamentary rules, the measure cannot be reintroduced for six more months. The government set up the anticorruption authority in 1997, but the Kenyan High Court invalidated it in December because it said the Constitution gave the prosecutorial powers it had only to the attorney general. At the behest of international lending institutions, Mr. Moi's government then sought to amend the Constitution to allow the independent body to operate -- a move that required the approval of 65 percent of the 222-member Parliament. Mr. Moi, who has great success in pushing measures through the legislature when only a simple majority is required, failed in his first attempt to amend the Constitution last week. Today he fell 15 votes short as 130 members voted for the anticorruption authority and 82 voted against. After the loss, Mr. Moi went out into the street to address the crowds that had gathered there. Ringed by security personnel, he said he was disappointed, accused lawmakers of not acting in the best interests of ordinary Kenyans, and vowed to fight corruption even without the authority. ""The government has all the machinery available to it to fight against corruption,"" he said. ""We are moving on."" But such a vow is unlikely to persuade officials withholding back funds from Kenya. The government has mounted crackdowns on corruption in the past but still has one of the world's worst problems with graft, according to Transparency International, a nonprofit group that reports annually on bribe-taking by public officials. A decade ago, the Kenyan Parliament enacted the Prevention of Corruption Act, with little result. In 1993, the government set up an anticorruption squad, which was disbanded after allegations of corruption. Few believe the resurrected Anticorruption Authority, even if the measure had passed, would have wiped out the problem either. ""Corruption has been there and will continue to be, as long as poverty reigns over the population and as long as the present caliber of selfish leaders continue to occupy respectable places,"" the Kenya Times, a paper allied with Mr. Moi, said in an editorial today that urged lawmakers to approve the anticorruption authority for the good of the people. Hundreds of those people stood outside the Parliament today debating the issue in the streets as the police struggled to keep order. That Kenya was suffering, nobody disputed. One bystander, Leo Oldoch, summed it up: ""These M.P.'s are going in their big cars, and we're going without shoes."""16-Aug-01,KENYA (94%); AFRICA (88%),"  The International Monetary Fund said it would keep in place a freeze on lending to Kenya after Parliament's rejection of an anticorruption measure on Tuesday. In a statement issued after the vote, the fund's representative in Kenya, Samuel Itam, said about $200 million that the fund approved for Kenya last year would be held back until the government takes action to curb corruption.   Marc Lacey (NYT)"22-Nov-01,ANGOLA (97%); NETHERLANDS (94%); PORTUGAL (92%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%); NIGERIA (79%); AFRICA (79%),"The dam in this mountainous scrubland stood unfinished for years until the Netherlands decided to foot the $ 2 million bill for completion. With lethal waterborne diseases such as malaria and cholera roaming the countryside, providing clean water to thousands of peasants here struck Dutch officials as a worthwhile cause. But their largess came with a string attached: No provincial government official was to touch any of the money. Instead, all disbursements would be handled by an international relief agency based here. ""Otherwise,"" said the Netherlands' ambassador to Angola, Jan Eric van den Berg, ""the work would never get done. I have seen it happen too many times here. Money has a way of disappearing in Angola."" This is a country on the take, disfigured by a core group of senior government officials whose corruption is so malignant that it has metastasized to virtually every level of Angola's public sector, according to diplomats, relief workers, academics and Angolans from all walks of life. Only Nigeria produces more oil than Angola in sub-Saharan Africa, but little of the revenue trickles down to the 12 million people who live in this former Portuguese colony. President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and the authoritarian political party that has governed Angola since its independence 26 years ago funnels the bulk of the country's resources into its unpopular, unyielding civil war against a stubborn rebel militia and pockets much of what remains, according to diplomats, human rights organizations and Angolans themselves. With little public money devoted to schools, roads, health care or wages for civil servants, Angola is a state of demoralizing and grotesque extremes: tycoons and refugees, filthy rich cabinet members with seaside vacation villas and dirt-poor homeless children who climb into sewers for their night's sleep. Civil servants earning as little as $ 50 a month take their cues from the ruling party, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, known by its Portuguese initials, MPLA. Graft here far exceeds the solicitation of petty bribes by traffic police and customs officials that happens at the margins of other poor countries, say diplomats, political analysts and relief workers. Here, underpaid teachers demand payment to enroll students in public schools that are nominally free. Doctors and nurses at state-run health clinics ask patients for a fee before tending to their injuries and ailments. Public hospitals frequently run short of supplies that are sold on the black market, and police, port authorities and employees with the motor vehicle department demand a tip, or gasosas -- literally a ""soft drink"" in Portuguese. ""If you want to get anything done in Angola, you must pay off someone,"" said Henriques Lopes, 23, who last year dropped out of Agostinho Neto University, the only public college in Luanda, the capital, when a professor demanded a $ 20-a-week bribe that he could not afford. ""I blame the government for that. People see how corrupt the government is and that the government doesn't care about them and they see all the [senior government officials] living in their big houses and driving big cars and eating well while everyone else is suffering. ""There is no right and wrong anymore. People feel they must do whatever they can to survive."" A 1996 government survey found that nearly half of all schoolchildren in Angola were required to make some kind of payment to an administrator to enroll in school. Another survey in 1998 concluded that 67.5 percent of doctors, lawyers and other professional workers on the state's payroll acknowledged that they would accept a bribe in return for services. Of managerial workers, the figure was 74 percent. The development arm of the United Nations wrote in 1998 that Angola's civil servants suffer a ""crisis of values, principles and ethical standards of behavior."" And in a speech delivered this year, dos Santos acknowledged that most civil servants did not survive on their salaries alone. ""The fact that the resources of Angola are obviously not being used for the benefit of most Angolans promotes corruption,"" said John Rocha, executive director of Angola 2000, an advocacy organization that promotes good government and an end to the civil war. ""Because the leadership acts with such impunity and such disregard for the welfare of others, they set an example for how all structures of government should engage with the public."" As it enters its 27th year, the war between the formerly Marxist MPLA -- supported by Cuba and the Soviet Union during the Cold War -- and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) -- which was supported by the United States and white-ruled South Africa -- has devoured the bulk of Angola's money. About 40 percent of the national budget was devoted to military expenditures in 1999, compared with less than 5 percent for education, 3 percent for health care and about 12 percent for salaries and benefits for the country's 200,000 civilian employees. Meager funding, coupled with soaring inflation rates, means that top department managers and administrators in the civil service earned the equivalent of about $ 27 per week in 1999. The weekly pay for janitors and other unskilled workers on the state's payroll was as little as $ 4.25. Calculating how much money is raked in by dos Santos and his cabinet is difficult, largely because the government does not account for the nearly $ 3 billion in annual oil revenue in its budget. The international human rights organization Global Witness released a report two years ago accusing dos Santos and a cadre of army generals of profiting from oil revenue and kickbacks on largely secret arms deals. Cabinet officials did not return telephone calls for comment. No public official here has ever been prosecuted on corruption charges, and the MPLA last year did agree for the first time to allow outside auditors to review its books in exchange for loans and grants from the International Monetary Fund and other global financial institutions. But foreign donors, relief workers and Angolans operate on the assumption that public funds are regularly looted. In the last democratic elections, held nine years ago, Angolans mocked the choices confronting them with the slogan: ""UNITA kills. The MPLA steals."" Angolans commonly refer to dos Santos as one of the world's 50 richest people and speculate that his wealth rivals that of Mobutu Sese Seko, the former kleptocratic ruler of Zaire, whose wealth was estimated to be in the billions before his death in exile four years ago. Earlier this year, Brazilian newspapers reported that dos Santos's wife, Ana Paula, spent more than $ 75,000 on a five-day shopping spree in that country. And in June, the MPLA evicted nearly 50,000 residents from the poor Luandan suburb of Boa Vista and moved them into tents to make way for a seaside luxury development. ""Our politicians get to eat and live well,"" said Jose Carrilho, 42, one of those evicted as he surveyed children playing soccer near a pond-sized reservoir of raw sewage on a filthy downtown street in Luanda. ""We get to live like rats. ""Everybody in Angola has their hand out for a bribe. When I used to work down at the port, everyone knew that the only way to get a shipment in was you had to either know someone very high up or you had to pay a little something extra. It's not right, but people are just trying to stay alive out here."" Life is particularly hard in rural regions like Lubango, where peasants rely on streams and other unsafe sources for water to drink and bathe with. Construction of a dam began more than a decade ago, then stopped before the project was completed. No explanation was given; none was needed. ""I am sure one of the politicians got their hands on the money,"" said Joaquim Furtado, 39, as he stood watching Ambassador van den Berg, provincial government officials and administrators with the U.N. World Food Program, visit the almost-finished dam. ""Not much good comes to the people here and whenever it does, it is done by outsiders, not our own government,"" said Furtado, an unemployed father of two. ""Our government is not good for much except robbing,"" he said, using his forearm to shield the midday sun from his eyes. ""That, they are very good at."""22-Nov-01,KENYA (97%); AFRICA (91%),"Kenya's president, Daniel arap Moi, announced a cabinet shuffle today, replacing his finance minister just after a public dispute with international donors and bringing the son of Kenya's founder, Jomo Kenyatta, into the cabinet. Analysts said the changes appeared intended to improve the governing party's chances of re-election next year. President Moi, 77 one of Africa's longest governing leaders, is not eligible to run again and seems eager for his party, the Kenya African National Union, to retain power. Finance Minister Chris Okemo was replaced by Foreign Affairs Minister Chris Obure. Mr. Okemo, who became finance minister in August 1999, has been moved to the Energy Ministry as co-minister. ""The removal of Okemo is not surprising,"" said John Githongo, the executive director of the Nairobi office of Transparency International, an organization that monitors corruption around the world. ""The collapse of relations between him and the donor community after recent rows may have led to him being dropped."" The presidential press service announced the changes without giving any reason for them. Kenya's hopes for securing a resumption of lending by the International Monetary Fund appeared to worsen last month when Mr. Okemo gave a speech accusing the fund of coercing Kenya into misguided economic policies. Kenyan financial markets have been depressed by the worst recession in the country since independence from Britain in 1963. The government is hoping that donors will restore aid, suspended last year over concerns about corruption. ""Okemo has rubbed the donors the wrong way recently,"" said Macharia Gaitho, a columnist with the Daily Nation newspaper. ""Moi must have felt that further talks with them would have been impossible with Okemo in office."" Mr. Moi brought Uhuru Kenyatta into the cabinet as local government minister. He is a prominent member of the large ethnic Kikuyu community that has traditionally opposed Mr.  Moi, who has been in office for 23 years."22-Dec-01,MOZAMBIQUE (96%),"The morning rain drenches the sidewalk shrine on the Avenue of Martyrs, soaking the red and purple ribbons and the sagging banners that still plead for justice. Blood no longer stains the street here, but when the clouds burst, it seems even the heavens grieve. Over the past 13 months, two prominent men have been assassinated in this prosperous neighborhood, exposing the violence and corruption accompanying the country's remarkable economic growth. After more than a decade of hunger and civil war, Mozambique gave up its guns and socialism to embrace the free market in the early 1990's. Foreign investors are pouring in and Mozambique now has one of the world's fastest growing economies. But over it all is a deadly shadow. Carlos Cardoso, an investigative journalist, was gunned down last year on the Avenue of Martyrs, a few blocks from his office. Antonio Siba-Siba Macuacua, a senior banking official, was hurled to his death from the 15th floor of a nearby bank four months ago. Both men were investigating allegations of corruption and mismanagement in the privatization of two banks that went bankrupt after they were sold. Earlier this year, the accounting firm KPMG, brought in to do an audit as irregularities surfaced, reported that some of the country's most powerful men, including some government officials, had borrowed and failed to repay thousands of dollars from one of the banks. Mr. Cardoso had reported such scandals relentlessly in his independent newspaper. In June, Mr. Siba-Siba took the unprecedented step of publishing the names of more than 1,000 of the debtors in Mozambique's only daily newspaper. The men worked in separate worlds, but each wanted to ensure that public funds were not wasted in a country still desperately poor despite progress since the war ended in 1992. Now both are dead, and the political establishment is reeling. Mr. Cardoso was the chief news editor of Mozambique's state news agency, a founder of the country's first independent media company and a fierce defender of the poor. He rarely worried about his own safety. ""He thought by publishing, that was a weapon against any threat,"" said his widow, Nina Berg. In his independent daily newspaper, Metical, Mr. Cardoso reported that $14 million was siphoned out of Banco Comercial de Mocambique on the eve of its privatization in 1996 and that the prosecutor's office was doing nothing to pursue those responsible. He was 49 when he was shot to death by gunmen with AK-47's after he left his office in November 2000. Mr. Siba-Siba, a senior auditor at the central bank, was relatively unknown until the government gave him the high-profile task of cleaning up Banco Austral, the nation's third-largest bank and one of its most troubled institutions. He learned that more than a million dollars was unaccounted for and that hundreds of prominent people had large unpaid debts. He was 34 and one of the nation's brightest young economists when someone hurled him down the stairwell at Banco Austral in August. In his state of the nation address this month, President Joachim Alberto Chissano acknowledged that the transition to capitalism has been accompanied by an alarming surge in violence and organized crime. The government has linked the killings of Mr. Cardoso and Mr. Siba-Siba to corruption in the banks and it has vowed to catch the killers. Six people have been charged with murdering Mr. Cardoso, including a former manager of Banco Comercial de Mocambique and a prominent businessman. No arrests have been made in the killing of Mr. Siba-Siba. This month the independent weekly Savana published a biting cartoon under the caption, ""Minister of Interior is prepared to fight crime."" It depicts the minister blowing a whistle while the criminals continue killing right behind his back. The killings have deepened the ambivalence here about the country's economic reforms and its privatization program, which are often praised by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as among the most successful in Africa. Since Mozambique held its first democratic election in 1994, inflation has fallen to about 10 percent, from 50 percent, the I.M.F. says. The economy has expanded by about 10 percent a year since 1997, although it dipped after the floods of 2000 before rebounding this year. Mozambique now grows enough food for its own people, no small accomplishment in a country where thousands were near starvation in the 1980's. But the failed privatization of Banco Comercial de Mocambique and Banco Austral, which were sold in 1996 and 1997, has come at a heavy cost to the state, which still owns minority stakes in the banks. On the streets here, privatization is often derided as a scheme that has enriched a privileged few and opened the door to the gangsterism that followed Russia's economic reforms in the 1990's. Two of every three Mozambicans still live in poverty. In October the I.M.F. reported that the benefits of the economic reforms to the poor ""are likely to be relatively modest"" in the short term. ""Ordinary people don't feel it, so the tendency to think that the reforms to our system have their relation with crime is there,"" Prime Minister Pascoal Manuel Mocumbi said in an interview. ""When you have a transition from one system to the other, you open space for criminals, you open space also for other problems that were unforeseen."" The killings have also exposed the weaknesses of the justice system, which officials say is inefficient, poorly financed, corrupt and poorly equipped to fight organized crime. Police officers assigned to Mr. Cardoso's killing were suspended after they failed to conduct the most basic of inquiries, including interviewing potential witnesses. A senior prosecutor in the attorney general's office fled the country after it became clear he had failed to investigate the theft of $14 million from Banco Comercial that Mr. Cardoso had reported. A warrant has been issued for his arrest. Ms. Berg, Mr. Cardoso's widow, and his friend and colleague, Joseph Hanlon, have also criticized Western donors who provided technical assistance and financial support to the banks but did little to resolve their problems before privatization. In a 1998 assessment of its programs here, the World Bank criticized its own strategy of supporting the two banks in the 1990's without correcting their ""almost total deficiency of corporate governance and widespread practice of politically motivated lending."" The report said 90 percent of the loans issued by Banco Austral and Banco Comercial would probably never be repaid. Mr. Hanlon, a journalist who also chronicled the collapse of the banks in Metical, said officials and donors knew the dangers when they privatized. On the Avenue of Martyrs, at the shrine set up after Mr. Cardoso was killed, there is a sign, ""Guns won't silence our voices."" Not far from the shrine, in a coffee shop in the bustling heart of this rapidly modernizing city, the uncle who raised Mr. Siba-Siba wept over a glass of Coca-Cola. This month the family took out a newspaper advertisement commemorate the young man who dreamed of sending his two children to college. ""We are a family destroyed,"" said Jorge Antonio Macuacua, the uncle, who considered Mr. Siba-Siba a son.  ""I'm not afraid to speak in my son's name, to demand an answer from the government,"" he said. ""Everybody in town is looking to the government for an answer. Mozambique is better than before. It is developing. But if nothing is done, then these people are going to keep killing."""25-Sep-02,GHANA (93%); UNITED STATES (92%); PHILIPPINES (79%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%); BRAZIL (79%); DOMINICAN REPUBLIC (79%); PAPUA NEW GUINEA (79%),"Wall Street gets it. So does Congress. Even President Bush gets it. But not the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. The era of market fundamentalism is over. Marketization, deregulation and privatization, and the opportunities for market manipulation offered by inadequate regulation -- all central elements in the rise and fall of Enron -- are now discredited in the United States. And in developing countries, where their effects have been most devastating, they are the object of widespread public opprobrium. Unfortunately, the IMF and the World Bank continue to sing from the market-fundamentalist hymnal. * Marketization: Just as Enron created new markets in exotic commodities such as bandwidth, so the IMF and the World Bank have worked to marketize services previously in the public and noncommercial realm. Case in point: user fees for primary health care. The World Bank continues to support such charges, even after reversing its support for education fees. The effect is to deny poor people access to care. In Papua New Guinea, for instance, the introduction of user fees led to a decline of about 30 percent in the average monthly attendance at outpatient health centers. * Deregulation: Reckless deregulation in California enabled Enron and other energy companies to gouge customers. Similarly, IMF- and World Bank-induced deregulation in developing countries has had disastrous consequences. In the Philippines and in Ghana, for example, deregulation in the mining sector has opened the country to giant multinational companies, displacing tens of thousands of residents and paving the way for environmental devastation. * Privatization: Central to Enron's international agenda was the takeover of privatized electricity and water services in developing countries. One country where Enron sought to gain control of a privatized water system was Ghana. Concerns about corruption -- including those voiced by the World Bank -- led to the collapse of the deal. But the World Bank continues to push for water privatization in the West African nation. In preparation, water prices have doubled, and the bank anticipates prices rising for the foreseeable future, even though poor Ghanaian consumers can pay as much as 10 percent to 20 percent of their income for drinking water. In a country where one-third of urban consumers are not even connected to water pipes, the private operators would have no duty to expand service to the poor. In the Dominican Republic, World Bank-supported privatization let Enron swoop in, buy parts of the electric utility and jack up rates. When consumers and the government couldn't pay the high prices, Enron turned off the power. Enron and other buyers of the privatized utility are now alleged to have paid too little, thanks to a valuation performed by an Arthur Andersen subsidiary. * Financial market manipulation: Enron's financial fraud is now legendary. But consider the IMF's deceit in Brazil: Everyone knows the country has no prospect of paying off its foreign debt. But rather than acknowledging this and working out a discounted payment arrangement for creditors, the IMF is making new loans to pay off old ones. This has two immediate effects: It enables the private creditors, including the big U.S. banks, to be paid off, with debt obligations shifted to the IMF. And it enables the IMF to extract austerity measures from Brazil that are explicitly intended to lock in fundamentalist market policies, no matter which party Brazilians elect in coming elections. Restraints on corporate power are even more necessary in developing countries than in the United States. But the market fundamentalists at the IMF and the World Bank continue to systematically unshackle corporate activity in the Southern Hemisphere. That's a major reason thousands will demonstrate against the IMF and the World Bank in Washington this weekend. Action makes a difference: In 2000, after the last major U.S. demonstrations against the IMF and the World Bank, Congress passed a law requiring the United States to oppose IMF or World Bank loans that include user fees for primary education or health care. Partly as a result, Tanzania lifted primary education user fees, 1.5 million additional children -- mostly girls -- were able to go to school.

Uhuru Kenyatta said a ""corruption epidemic"" was preventing Kenya from regaining what he called its lost glory. He said that while he favored zero tolerance of corruption, cited by donor institutions as a major barrier to fighting poverty and crime, the priority had to be building accountable and open administrative structures. The International Monetary Fund and other donors suspended lending to Kenya in 2000 over corruption concerns, deterring many investors."30-Nov-02,ANGOLA (98%),"When Angola's long civil war ended this year, critics of the government hoped that peace would begin to change a nation considered one of the world's most corrupt. So far, say many of those critics, the encouraging signs are few, and a confidential report by the International Monetary Fund documenting the disappearance of almost $1 billion from state coffers just last year, is only increasing the calls for reform. Little in the I.M.F.'s report came as a surprise to people who follow the country. But what was remarkable was the uncharacteristic bluntness of the wording. ""Governance and transparency issues continue to be of serious concern, with corruption widespread throughout society,"" says the report, which began surfacing in news reports last month. Arvind Ganesan, the director of the business and human rights program at Human Rights Watch, said he was stunned by the report's candor. ""In the etiquette of an I.M.F. report, it is brutal,"" he said in a telephone interview from London, where he had been taking part in a conference on Angola. Simply including a line for ""unexplained"" discrepancies, as the I.M.F. did in its tables outlining state spending, is a pointed swipe at the government and its pattern of stonewalling the fund, Mr. Ganesan said. Senior Angolan officials were reported to be furious, and the chief spokesman for the ministry of finance refused to answer questions about the report. The 45-page document outlines a string of unexplained fiscal discrepancies that over the last several years have represented anywhere from 2 percent to 23 percent of the country's gross domestic product. In a country where hunger and disease are widespread and 19 babies out of every 100 die before their first birthday, the disappearance of so much state money is devastating. Ordinary ineptitude and inefficiency make it difficult -- some would say deliberately difficult -- to assemble a true picture of the nation's finances. It is hard to know how much is lost to corruption and how much is simply lost. Costly oil-backed loans, secured in secret to tide the government through cash crunches, have been another drain on state funds. But the report leaves no doubt that its authors believe corruption is at the core of the country's economic problems. The huge bonus payments that oil companies must pay to secure drilling rights for Angola's offshore reserves have been a particular concern of critics. The I.M.F report shed some light on why. Rarely, the report says, is the expenditure of bonus money detailed in fiscal accounts, and even then, the amounts received are sometimes grossly underreported. For instance, the government told the I.M.F. that it received $285 million in bonus payments after auctioning the rights to a prime deep-water block in September 2001. But the companies that paid the bonuses claim they paid about $400 million, leaving more than $100 million unaccounted for. How the leaking of the report, which was completed in March and widely circulated among donor nations and multilateral organizations, will affect the already cool relationship between the fund and the Angolan government will become clearer in the coming weeks and months. Abdoulaye Bio Tchane, the chief of the I.M.F.'s Africa division, was in Luanda this month for talks with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who has led Angola since 1979. The I.M.F. hopes that Mr. Bio Tchane's visit, the first by a high-ranking fund official in several years, will begin to persuade the Angolan leader that his nation should move far more aggressively to correct the structural problems that have made its finances so vulnerable to plunder. Unlike the persistent accusations of organizations like Global Witness and Human Rights Watch, the findings of the I.M.F. -- which provides low interest loans and technical assistance to poor countries -- carry real consequences for the government. Without the support of the I.M.F., Angola will struggle to raise the hundreds of millions of dollars it says it needs from the world's richest nations to rebuild the war-ravaged infrastructure of the country. Whatever happens, Angola will face skepticism from donors perplexed by a country with so much oil and yet so little money, even now after the civil war, to spend on its shattered population. The oil sector, and in particular the state oil company, Sonangol, come in for particular attention in the report. Sonangol, the report says, has never been ""independently audited."" Its accounting procedures are ""not in line with international accounting standards."" It manages the country's oil-related receipts through ""a web of opaque offshore accounts,"" instead of through the country's central bank as required by law. ""The lack of transparency regarding oil sector flows and external debt operations undermine the budgetary process and public accountability and hamper the formulation of public policies,"" the report says. Comments earlier this month by the minister of finance, however, suggest that the government is a long way from seeing the situation the way the fund does. In an interview published in the country's state-controlled newspaper, the minister, Julio Bessa, denied the allegations of corruption and said the I.M.F. had not made any such accusations. A lack of resources, he said, had led to problems in the management of the nation's finances, and those shortcomings are being corrected. He said the report was being twisted and manipulated to embarrass the government. The government has taken some steps to improve and open up. For the first time in recent memory, the budget was passed before the start of the fiscal year, and the ministry of finance has set up a public Web site. But critics scoff at the efforts, saying the government is disclosing only what it wants to. ""It's not serious,"" said Jose Cerqueira, an economist on leave from the Catholic University of Angola. ""It's an effort at propaganda. They are not really interested in transparency and putting out figures for everyone to analyze."""29-Dec-02,KENYA (99%); RWANDA (79%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%),"When Mwai Kibaki was injured in a car accident this month, he didn't seek treatment at his local hospital. He went to the airport and boarded a flight to London. Kibaki's injuries were relatively straightforward -- a broken arm and a sprained ankle -- but Kenyan hospitals just don't provide the level of medical care he wanted. His decision to go abroad was hardly unusual. Kenyans and foreigners who can afford to do so frequently travel to developed countries for health care. But Kibaki, 71, attracted more attention than most. He was running for president of Kenya, and his evacuation to Britain in the thick of the campaign was a stinging reminder of the painful lack of basic services in this East African nation of 30 million people. ""It's sad really,"" said Meshach Onguti, the new director of Kenyatta National Hospital, where overcrowding forces two and three patients to share a bed, and technology in the emergency room dates from around the late 1970s. ""Kibaki's decision to leave his own country for medical care, well, it's just this huge metaphor for the state of every service in this country."" Kenyan voters went to the polls on Friday for a watershed election that will end the 24-year rule of the loved, hated and omnipresent President Daniel arap Moi, who is barred under the constitution from running again. Partial results indicate that Kibaki's trip to London didn't hurt his candidacy a bit; the opposition leader appears headed for a landslide victory. If Kibaki indeed wins, he will inherit a seemingly endless list of problems to solve: not just inadequate health care, but a scarcity of jobs, a public education system in shambles and a shattered infrastructure of rocky roads, sporadic electricity and balky telephones. Some Kenyans wonder where he should begin; others say the answer is simple: End corruption. Nothing is blamed more frequently for the country's woes than rampant corruption and patronage. Kenyan political analysts say corruption is woven through every element of a society that has come to accept the inevitability of giving or getting ""a little something"" to get through each day. Kenyans regularly speak of being unable to get a job, proper hospital care, a driver's license, phone lines and even a chance to pay bills unless they bribe someone. ""Corruption is the key, really,"" said John Githongo local head of Transparency International, a corruption watchdog group with a special office in Nairobi. ""I mean, this country collects billions in taxes each year. And if you look at what the government does with it, it's not very much. ""We have in Kenya impunity towards corruption. Rwandans know genocide; we know corruption. And it has hurt us and held us back."" Under Moi, critics say, a system of patronage developed that favored a small percentage of the population -- police to teachers to the distant cousins of government ministers -- and provided nothing for the vast majority of Kenyans. For example, some blame the terrorist attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in 1998 and the Paradise Hotel in Mombasa last month on the fact that weapons can easily be smuggled into the country with a bribe. When phones don't work, the electricity goes out and roads become wracked with deep potholes, it is often the funds that are meant to maintain these services that get pocketed. It often takes a bribe to get a job or run a business. ""I tried to get a job. At one point I attempted to sell eggs. It all collapsed,"" said James Maato, 26, who has been unemployed for five years and sat listlessly at a city park one day recently. ""There was too much corruption. I couldn't get anything done. I had to hand out a bit of money, and I didn't have enough."" While few Kenyans question the importance of rooting out corruption, some are unsure if either Kibaki or his principal opponent, ruling party candidate Uhuru Kenyatta, is capable of doing it. ""They are going to have to clean up a big mess,"" said Sammy Wambua, a political analyst for the East African Standard, a major newspaper here. ""There [are] a lot of [people] at every level who will be working against them. It may take a very, very long time and a lot of desire to really do it."" Nevertheless, whoever wins will be under intense international pressure to commit to tackling the issue. Such international agencies as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are withholding hundreds of millions of dollars earmarked for Kenya until corruption is reined in. When the IMF suspended a $ 220 million loan in 1997, it said it was doing so because of ""absurd and arguably unnecessary donor rituals."" Leaders of Kibaki's National Rainbow Coalition have announced plans to form a national forgiveness and reconciliation team that would offer anyone charged with stealing money from the government a chance to avoid prosecution by giving the money back. They also said they would begin forming committees to combat corruption and patronage in the police department and the court system. ""Jobs will be given on merit,"" said Raila Odinga, an opposition leader. ""Jobs will no longer be given on the basis of someone's tribe or where they come from."" Kibaki has also said that if he wins the election, he will publicly declare his wealth -- something that Moi has never done. Watchdog groups have said Kibaki's idea could set a new tone toward stopping corruption in everyday life. The election campaign offered little hope, however, as candidates continued the practice of handing out money for what Kenyans commonly call ""our daily bread."" In the rural village of Mbeere, in the impoverished eastern section of the country, Kenyatta's sister gave out ""tea"" -- the euphemism for a bribe on Christmas Day. Families lined up for the equivalent of $ 2.50, in a country where most people live on a dollar a day. In response, the Daily Nation newspaper ran an editorial that warned Kenyans: ""Don't vote with your stomachs."" At Kenyatta National Hospital, examples of how corruption hurts every level of the institution's functions can be seen at every turn. Onguti, the new director, said he had to fire much of the staff for inefficiency and corruption. At the same time, the IMF has withheld health care funding since 2000 until the moribund Kenya anti-corruption authority resumes work. Both presidential candidates have said they would restore that unit. The hospital's bathrooms are dirty, with urine-stained floors and feces smeared across toilets, and nurses said they were told to pay for cleaning supplies with their own money. There is no MRI machine, and cancer patients have to wait three months or more for treatment because there isn't enough equipment. Conditions at other medical centers throughout the country are worse. In a country where 700 people die every day of an HIV-related illness, an HIV/AIDS clinic in Mombasa has only headache medicine and rubbing alcohol. ""The problem is, shall we say, misappropriation of funds and a lack of international money,"" said Ewoi Benguwn, a doctor at the Fatima Medical Clinic as she handed an aspirin to an AIDS patient. ""I mean, honestly, most doctors who work here won't get medical treatment in this country."" Editorial assistant Candice Miranda contributed to this report."29-Mar-03,KENYA (98%); AFRICA (79%),"One of the ministers in Kenya's new government found a briefcase full of cash in his office recently, left behind by a visitor steeped in the old way of influencing policy makers in this country, considered one of the most corrupt in the world. But Kenya is not the place it was just a few months ago. The minister did not empty out the briefcase as his predecessors might have. Instead, he chased down its owner and threw him out of the building. In the old Kenya, it took a small bill to avoid a traffic ticket. A few coins might encourage a bureaucrat to process a form. Getting a telephone line meant slipping a stack of shilling notes into an outstretched palm. None of those petty transactions approached the graft in the country's executive suites, though. Manipulated contracts and other elaborate scams have shifted billions of dollars of public money into private pockets over the decades, various studies have shown. But in the nearly three months since Kenyans voted out the party that had ruled for the last 39 years, a significant change has taken place. President Mwai Kibaki has not managed to wipe out the dirty dealings that had become so deeply rooted during the long tenure of his predecessor, Daniel arap Moi. But in declaring ""a culture of zero tolerance to corruption,"" he has begun to turn the tide. ""Corruption has undermined our economy, our politics and our national psyche,"" Mr. Kibaki declared at the opening of the Parliament last month. ""It has undermined our most important institutions and tarnished our reputations as Kenyan leaders."" Throughout Africa, new governments typically vow to root out their predecessors' misdeeds. Making headway is another matter. Even in the midst of the current anticorruption drive, a police officer effectively asked for money recently at a traffic stop not far from Mr. Kibaki's presidential residence. A bureaucrat with a photograph of Mr. Kibaki hanging in his office suggested strongly that a few coins might prompt him to act more swiftly. At the state-run telephone company, an employee stretched out her palm. ""This huge beast called government has hundreds of thousands of people, and it takes time to change,"" said the government's new anticorruption chief, John Githongo, who until recently was a newspaper columnist and antigraft crusader. At least in the new Kenya, the police officer did not demand money, as he would have before. Instead, he talked about how poorly paid police officers were -- about $100 a month for his job -- and practically begged for a handout. The bureaucrat, despite some hints, never explicitly mentioned ""a little tea,"" the Kenyan euphemism for a bribe, and eventually did his job without one. ""Bribes are still changing hands, but it's being done very quietly now,"" said Mwalimu Mati, acting director of the Kenyan office of Transparency International, the private group that monitors corruption worldwide and listed Kenya as the sixth most corrupt country last year. ""What has changed substantially is the expressions of political will that were absent before. The president is talking about it. Ministers are attacking it."" Tainted officials, meanwhile, are falling rapidly. Chief Justice Bernard Chunga resigned after Mr. Kibaki set up a tribunal to investigate corruption accusations against him. The chief of the central bank, Nahashon Nyagah, and the government's top tax collector, John Munge, stepped down recently after a scandal involving a looted bank. Just what happened to the deposits is unclear, although many government agencies lost huge sums of taxpayer money in the collapse. The chief executive of the state-run Kenya Power and Lighting Company, James Gichuru, was also replaced. The company was losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year despite its monopoly on power supply and distribution. Worst of all, the lights in Kenya regularly went out. Mr. Kibaki has also ordered a thorough inquiry into what is perhaps Kenya's most notorious corruption scandal, the complex Goldenberg affair, which cost taxpayers hundreds of millions in the early 1990's. The central bank paid out the money to Goldenberg International in export credits for gold, diamonds and jewelry that turned out to be nonexistent. Hundreds of everyday Kenyans jammed into a conference room a few weeks ago to watch the start of the investigation, which is likely to involve some of the biggest names in politics, including people in Mr. Kibaki's own government. The scandal is widely blamed for sending Kenya's entire economy into a nose dive, throwing many people out of work. Mr. Githongo, who headed Transparency International before Mr. Kibaki tapped him to be an ethics adviser, said the new administration's inquiry would be a test of its pledge to follow the truth wherever it leads. ""The fight against corruption will not be credible if we focus on individuals,"" he said. ""With Goldenberg, we're saying: 'Hold on. We have a series of cases here that nobody understands. Let's have this commission of inquiry in which everyone can be called. If particular individuals provide information and that leads to certain people, that's O.K. But there is no list.' "" Although Mr. Githongo acknowledged that there would be delicate political realities to contend with in the investigations, he declared, ""There are no untouchables."" Mr. Kibaki is also seeking a law requiring an accounting of campaign spending in all of Kenya's usually corrupt political contests and a requirement that all politicians, himself included, declare their wealth. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund suspended most of their loans to Kenya in recent years because allocations were said to have been misspent under Mr. Moi. Mr. Kibaki has said he will meet the institutions' demand that the government create an independent anticorruption body. What many Kenyans wonder is whether Mr. Kibaki will eventually get aroundto pursuing his predecessor. Mr. Moi retired from office when the Constitution prevented him from seeking another term and handed power over to Mr. Kibaki, who was not Mr. Moi's choice but who won a resounding victory in elections in December. Even some of Mr. Moi's detractors say he ought to be left alone and given credit for stepping down. Prosecuting him, as Zambia recently did with its former president, would, they contend, needlessly divide the country. Others, however, say that going after big fish like Mr. Moi would send a powerful message. Mr. Kibaki's aides say they intend to set up a panel modeled after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa to expose the many human rights violations during the Moi years. As for economic crimes, they are to be investigated and prosecuted in an effort to return stolen assets to the people. ""The law will guide this process,"" Mr. Githongo said. ""No one is exempt. The former president is just an ordinary Kenyan now. The law applies to him -- and everyone else."""4-Jul-03,KENYA (79%),"Once upon a time, World Bank financiers viewed their mission in narrow terms: Lend money to poor countries to try to make them richer. The governments that borrowed the money might let a bribe determine who was awarded a contract, and money intended for new highways or hospitals was sometimes siphoned off for other purposes, such as buying weapons. But overall, bank officials said, a little bit of corruption was tolerable -- often necessary -- to make economic development work. They don't say that anymore. Responding to evidence that corruption impedes the progress of failing economies, the World Bank in the late 1990s began cracking down on the corrupt practices of its borrowers. ""The one thing I'm proudest of is our work on corruption,"" bank President James D. Wolfensohn said recently. Before he took office in 1995, Wolfensohn said, the bank considered corruption ""an issue of politics,"" as opposed to one of economic development. Now, ""it is now central to what we do."" Under Wolfensohn, the bank began participating in international efforts to fight corruption. It developed internal controls to audit its projects. It compiled a blacklist of nearly 100 companies and individuals banned from receiving bank-funded contracts because of bribery, theft or for breaking other rules. Since 1996, the bank has started more than 600 anti-corruption programs in nearly 100 countries, according to a published statement. Some observers of the World Bank -- which reported that it lent $ 19.5 billion of dollars in the year ended June 30, 2002 -- say it should be doing more to discourage the governments and companies it works with from misusing its money, which comes mostly from the governments of rich countries. The bank has continued to fund projects in countries where corruption is said to be rampant, such as Bangladesh. Only one country, Kenya, has been prohibited from receiving bank loans because of its government's corrupt practices, and that was temporary. Despite the blacklist, the bank sometimes has been reluctant to ban companies that violate its rules. Because many of the world's most corrupt countries are also among the poorest, the bank's new stance can force difficult choices between continuing aid to a country that needs it and cutting it to discourage corruption. Poor countries are also notoriously poor record-keepers, making auditing more difficult. ""No one says this is easy. It's a trade-off,"" said Peter Eigen, founder and president of Transparency International, a corruption watchdog group. ""You can't just have a simplistic link between the level of corruption and the level of funding. Some of these countries would really struggle without the bank's loans."" Eigen, who left the World Bank in 1991 when his pleas for a stronger anti-corruption stance were ignored, said he believes that under Wolfensohn the bank has made fighting corruption a priority. ""It's very hard to change a large organization like the World Bank, and they're still working through this,"" Eigen said. ""They were pretty bad, and allowed [corruption] to become a major problem. There's been a total change in policy, but to change from policy to total implementation is a long way to go. While I'd be hard pressed to say they've licked it, they are an enthusiastic and effective partner."" The U.S. General Accounting Office evaluated the bank's anti-corruption efforts and gave a mixed review in a June report. While it found that the bank had taken ""important steps"" toward reducing internal corruption, the agency also recommended further action, including a more extensive audit of whether the bank's loans are used for their intended purposes. The bank ""has a long way to go,"" said William Easterly, an economics professor at New York University. ""If the client is important enough geostrategically or one they want to cultivate in the long run, they will continue lending to them, despite long histories of corruption. They continue forcing loans down that pipe."" Corruption can take many forms, but it is usually defined as the misuse of public office or money for private gain. In the 1980s and early 1990s, most academic literature on economic development argued that corruption could help ""grease the wheels"" of a fledgling economy. But after several studies showed that corruption impedes development, many foreign aid programs began advocating ""zero tolerance"" toward corruption. The World Bank responded to the shifting conventional wisdom. Soon after Wolfensohn railed against the ""cancer of corruption"" at the bank's 1996 annual meeting in Hong Kong, the bank formed an investigative body to audit its loans and set up a 24-hour hotline to allow staff and members of the public to report allegations of corruption. In November 1998 the bank convened a ""sanctions committee"" to punish companies and individuals guilty of corruption. In 2000 it formed a ""department of institutional integrity"" to investigate allegations of corruption within the bank or in connection with bank-funded contracts. It also started working with anti-corruption groups that once were highly critical of its activities. With Transparency International, the bank supports anti-corruption efforts such as an initiative to better account for money lent to countries involved in military conflicts. To combat corruption, the bank can ban, or ""debar,"" companies that use bribes and other unethical means to secure contracts, or it can directly punish governments by denying or decreasing loans to those where corruption is rampant. World Bank officials cited a recent audit of an urban development project in Sulawesi, Indonesia, as an example of a successful crackdown on companies. A 2002 review of the project -- for which the bank provided money to improve water services, housing, sanitation, flood control, roads and transportation on the remote Indonesian island -- found widespread corruption in procurement. In April of this year, the bank debarred 15 Indonesian companies for various lengths of time. The bank has permanently debarred 93 companies, but provides no information about them beyond their names and where they are based. The list includes four local firms. Asia Construction, which the blacklist says is located in Delaware and Maryland, is out of business. Two other companies, Digidata and Knowledge Engineering, both of Virginia, are owned by David Riper, of Fairfax, whose name also appears on the bank's blacklist. He was accused of paying a kickback to a bank official to help secure a contract on a project in Nairobi. Riper declined a request for comment. One Washington company, International Access Corp., is debarred until 2004. An attorney for the company said in a prepared statement that the firm ""was not treated fairly"" by the bank but did not address the reasons for the bank's decision. Despite the lengthy list of banned companies, several critics say that simply targeting firms that don't follow the rules is not enough. ""The view of most economists is that all the money is really going into one pot,"" Easterly said. ""The government might refrain from stealing funds on a World Bank project, but compensate by stealing more from another project."" Instead, Easterly advocates cutting off countries whose governments have demonstrable corruption problems. In June, the bank announced that Kenya, an East African country making a difficult transition to democracy after decades of one-party rule, was approved for a new loan of more than $ 100 million. In the past decade, Kenya has temporarily been cut off from funding by the World Bank and its affiliate lending organization, the International Monetary Fund, because of widespread political corruption. As recently as May, a government official there was accused of taking a $ 100,000 bribe from a contractor in the Kenya Urban Transport Initiative Program, a bank project that was suspended in August 2002 because of charges of rampant bribery and embezzlement. In approving the recent loan, the bank cited several steps Kenya's new government took to combat corruption. Meanwhile, the bank continues to increase its lending to Bangladesh, a poor and densely populated South Asian country plagued by debilitating floods, which consistently ranks near the top of world corruption surveys. It is due to receive $ 554 million from the World Bank this year, and roughly the same amount next year, said Enrique Pantoja, a World Bank country officer for Bangladesh. The country's loan package for the previous three years averaged around $ 250 million a year, he said. ""Not all poor countries are equally corrupt,"" Easterly said. ""Why can't they do better at lending to those that do better?"" Other development experts point out that the level of corruption in a country is difficult to define and to quantify. Transparency International's index, which ranked Bangladesh as the most corrupt country in the world for 2002, measures the international community's ""perception"" of corrupt practices, which some say can be misleading. ""Bangladesh is actually a tricky case,"" said Steven Radelet, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development. ""The Transparency number has a few asterisks. It's based on fewer sources than the others. This is not Zimbabwe, not Nigeria. It's not a disaster, or a kleptocracy. They've made progress in a number of other areas like health care and family planning. So they're getting a big check this year. It's a judgment call."" Transparency International's Eigen said: ""Sometimes when companies start to take corruption seriously, more cases are uncovered. It gives the impression that they are more corrupt when they are actually doing better. The bank seems to be handling these cases well."" Anti-corruption advocates said they will be watching closely what has, up until now, been the most widely publicized case of corruption in a bank-funded project: the Highlands Water Project, a dam and power plant built in the late 1990s in Lesotho, a tiny mountain kingdom in southern Africa. Government authorities there charged several companies with various forms of corruption, including paying bribes to win contracts. The World Bank debarred several of the smaller firms involved, but one large multinational corporation, Acres International of Canada -- which in 2002 was found guilty of paying a $ 266,000 bribe to the project's head -- has not been punished so far. ""We are continuing to get legal advice on that,"" Wolfensohn said. ""It is still under review.""

An Angolan government official is expected to disclose on Thursday that the country is receiving $300 million from ChevronTexaco at a deal-signing ceremony in Washington with the company's chief executive, David J. O'Reilly, three executives with knowledge of the agreement said. The deal extends Chevron's outstanding rights to the shallow-water oil and gas field known as Block Zero through 2030. Angola and other developing nations have been under scrutiny from human rights groups, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the British government to reveal what they receive from oil companies for access to national crude reserves. Angola has been trying to strengthen ties with the United States and foreign investors, and the payment announcement would come in the middle of Angolan president Jose Eduardo dos Santos's three-day trip to the United States. He met with President Bush on Wednesday morning. The United States is the market for more than half of Angola's estimated production of 950,000 barrels a day. Angola's finance minister, Jose Pedro de Morais, disclosed the amount of the ChevronTexaco payment to Angolan media last week, and a spokesman for the oil company confirmed that an announcement was expected Thursday, but did not provide details. Mr. de Morais was unavailable for comment on Wednesday, a spokesman in Angola's Washington embassy said. What energy and mining companies pay governments for drilling rights has become a hot-button issue as resources in the developed world dry up. ''We are running out of places to find oil,'' said Karina Litvack, head of governance and socially responsible investment at ISIS Asset Management in London. Oil companies are starting to look for resources, she said, ''where the money the companies pay the government sometimes fuels corruption, instability or human rights abuses.'' By disclosing the amount it is being paid, Angola's government is setting ''a new standard for transparency,'' Ms. Litvack said. ''We are cautiously optimistic,'' said Ben Mellor, an official with Britain's Department for International Development. Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain started the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative, known as E.I.T.I., in 2001, and many international oil companies and shareholders groups have said they support the initiative's call for increased disclosure. Angola's decision to make public the money it is receiving from ChevronTexaco may represent a ''real turning point'' for the country, Mr. Mellor said. Nigeria and Azerbaijan had recently stepped up disclosure of payments they have received from foreign oil companies after receiving outside pressure. Angola, which emerged from nearly 30 years of civil war in 2002, is struggling with food shortages, a large debt, and high poverty and H.I.V. rates among its 10.8 million citizens. Human Rights Watch estimated that $4.2 billion in oil revenues were unaccounted for in Angola from 1997 to 2002. The government has said such numbers are misleading, but it is under intense pressure from outside agencies and foreign investors to provide figures. ''The goal is to make the government accountable for how it manages its resources,'' said Karin Lissakers, an adviser to George Soros, the financier and philanthropist. Mr. Soros supports Publish What You Pay, a campaign to encourage oil companies to disclose the payments they make to developing nations. Angola's expected announcement on Thursday is an ''important step,'' Ms. Lissakers said, but ''one hopes they will take the next step and adopt the E.I.T.I. standards for the whole sector.'' ChevronTexaco is the biggest foreign oil producer in Angola, and pumps about 400,000 barrels a day from the Block Zero field. The company operates Block Zero, and shares ownership with France's Total, Italy's ENI and Angola's government-owned oil company. ChevronTexaco is paying $210 million to sign the 20-year agreement, as well as $80 million to develop social programs in the region and another $10 million in production-related payments.

When the price of crude oil hit $50 a barrel last week, sending ripples of anxiety around the world, analysts blamed a young Nigerian man with a machine gun and a speedboat. He is Mujahid Dokubo-Asari, a militia boss who is threatening to start a civil war and shut down the Nigerian oil industry, which is the fifth-largest supplier of crude oil to the United States. He will do this, he says, unless his people, the Ijaw, who live on top of Nigeria's oil fields, are granted autonomy. By ''autonomy,'' he means ''control of the oil money.'' Nigerian officials dismiss Mr. Asari as a gangster. But if so, he is a gangster who has friends in the ruling party and is taken seriously enough that Nigeria's president, Olusegun Obasanjo, felt obliged to sit down and negotiate with him last week. Mr. Obasanjo is a well-meaning fellow, but his job is made more difficult because he is surrounded by crooks. Nigeria, like much of Africa, ought to be rich but is miserably poor. The main reason is that rather than striving to create an environment in which their people can freely seek prosperity and happiness, most African governments have chosen instead to rob them. This culture of criminality has spread throughout the ruling class, down to the Nigerian border guard who threatened to beat up my driver last month if I didn't give him a dollar, to the bribe-hungry Cameroonian police officers who stopped a truck I was riding in 47 times in 300 miles. This corruption makes it hard to do business in Africa. Manufacturers need smooth roads, reliable electricity and efficient ports. But too often in Africa, the roads are craterous because someone has looted the maintenance budget, the power fails because the state monopoly utility company is staffed with politicians' idiot cousins, and the customs officers hang onto your goods for weeks in the hope that you will bribe them to hurry up. In only two African countries -- South Africa and Botswana -- is it relatively easy to do business, a recent World Bank study found. For bright, energetic Africans, it is often easier to get rich by joining the government than by creating honest wealth. That is why the debt relief proposal debated over the weekend in Washington by officials from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Group of 7 nations would be not be a panacea for Africa. Faster debt relief is a good idea for countries with relatively clean, pragmatic governments that pursue sensible economic policies, like Mozambique and Uganda. But debt relief cannot help the worst-governed countries like Zimbabwe and Angola because their leaders are likely to squander the money it frees up. In those places, extra cash props up despots. This is a more complex picture than many debt-relief campaigners will admit. It may be, as Oxfam complains, that Zambia cannot hire enough teachers because the monetary fund has told its government not to run too large a budget deficit. But that is not the whole story. The main reason Zambia is bankrupt is that it has been ruled with startling incompetence and venality; for example, its previous president, Frederick Chiluba, is facing multiple charges of embezzlement. Outsiders cannot fundamentally change the way Africa is governed. That is a task for Africans themselves, and some are rising to the challenge. In Nigeria, President Obasanjo has hired a team of technocrats to curb corruption by making the public accounts more transparent. They are doing their best, but one of them told me that probably no more than one powerful Nigerian in 20 supports the clean-up. That in a nutshell is why Africans are poor: their leaders keep them that way."9-Oct-04,EQUATORIAL GUINEA (99%); UNITED STATES (93%); SPAIN (79%),"The Sept. 2 letter from Ambassador Teodoro Biyogo Nsue of Equatorial Guinea mentioned ""recent positive steps taken"" by President Teodoro Obiang Nguema's regime. However, the International Monetary Fund recently issued reports critical of Equatorial Guinea's lack of transparency and accountability on fiscal matters. Further, Equatorial Guinea's government does not account for funds from national oil revenue, which, according to a U.S. Senate investigation on money laundering, are diverted to the personal accounts of members of the president's family. Abayak -- a group owned by Mr. Obiang -- also controls Equatorial Guinea's biggest projects, including the Malabo gas plant. Most government and security posts are held by Mr. Obiang's family. Recent elections were won with 97.5 percent of votes going to Mr. Obiang's party. Observers were unanimous in their harsh criticism  of these elections. Opposition parties were subject to threats and violence, according to the international press. The Bush administration has condemned the Obiang regime for not fighting human trafficking. Freedom House, Human Rights Watch and Reporters Without Borders all have named Mr. Obiang as one of the world's worst dictators. The State Department also has criticized the country's human rights abuses, use of torture and culture of corruption. Cesar Chelala, a public health consultant and writer on human rights issues, found during a recent visit to Equatorial Guinea that despite the phenomenal oil boom, the living standard of ordinary people had not improved in a decade. Malaria is rampant, and child morbidity and mortality rates have not improved. New wealth has been almost exclusively used for the enrichment of the country's leaders. Equatorial Guinea needs free elections, shared oil revenue and an independent judicial system.

He managed to get an arm and a leg through the gate but was pushed back. ""You are late. I can't let you in,"" the guard yelled as he slammed the gate. The furious worker stormed off. Clement, who gave only his first name, was the latest victim of a crackdown on tardiness in the public sector in this central African country, which has the dubious honor of regularly being named one of the most corrupt nations in the world. The crackdown -- locking out workers who do not arrive on time -- coincides with a government initiative to stamp out corruption in the state sector. It's a high-stakes cleanup. Last year, Cameroon was ranked the eighth-most-corrupt country in the world in a global index compiled by watchdog Transparency International, and foreign donors are growing impatient with the slow pace of reform. President Paul Biya has blamed the reluctance of international institutions to invest in Cameroon on inertia in the state system. Cameroon's crackdown is unusual on a continent where civil servants often enjoy special status, given the scarcity of jobs in the private sector and the use of public posts for political patronage. But some insiders agree with the measures. ""Civil servants . . . have been behaving like children,"" said an employee in the ministry of economy and finance in the run-down capital, Yaounde. ""Some of my colleagues even come in at 11 a.m. It was high time the government did something about it."" Across Africa, slack civil servants can make the most routine administrative task take hours or even days. Some don't set foot in their offices for weeks or months, instead seeking odd jobs to boost what are often meager wages. In the West African country of Ivory Coast, a former prime minister introduced spot checks and sanctions for absent workers in the early 1990s, but to no lasting effect. In neighboring Mali, Prime Minister Ousmane Issoufi Maiga, a disciplinarian nicknamed ""Pinochet"" after the former Chilean dictator, is also trying to stamp out tardiness by setting an example in his office. In Cameroon, it was a surprise visit by new Prime Minister Ephraim Inoni to the Ministry of Public Service that signaled the hardening of attitudes. Two absent employees were fired the next day -- and the word was out. ""Things will not be the same again. The president has decided there will be change and things must change. . . . The time of recreation is over,"" said Johnson Doh Okie, director of general administration in the ministry. Officially, work starts in the public sector at 7:30 a.m. and ends at 3:30 p.m. People now have a 30-minute period of grace to get in, but at 8 a.m., the gates are locked. Details of exactly what sanctions tardy employees can expect are yet to be made public, but most fear their wages will be cut. Cameroon, which is feeling the pinch of declining oil output after a post-independence economic boom, is eager to woo foreign donors who have criticized the condition of public finances and a general lack of transparency in the government. In December, the ratings agency Standard & Poor's said Cameroon would probably miss out on payments from the International Monetary Fund under a poverty reduction plan and said the country's public finances were in disarray. The IMF is in talks with Cameroon to try to draw up an economic program that would help it qualify for aid under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative. Donors may welcome the public sector crackdown, but many workers say they cannot be blamed for being late. The state-owned bus company went bankrupt in 1993, and since then there has been no bus service in Yaounde and the port city Douala. Inoni said he had asked the transport minister to organize a public system. ""It is not easy to commute in a town like Yaounde,"" said Jean Marc Bikoko, president of the Public Sectors Workers union. ""With the present level of wages, how can civil servants afford to take a taxi every day, not to mention buying a car?"" Civil servants' wages were slashed in 1993 after international institutions recommended the government eliminate thousands of jobs. The government preferred to cut and freeze wages rather than opt for politically sensitive redundancies. Late or lazy workers are just one part of the problem. In January, the Finance Ministry published a list of 71 state workers who had been sanctioned for offenses ranging from embezzlement to over-billing. Some think the cleanup will fizzle out. For Clement, however, the damage was already done. ""Do you know how much effort we make every day to be here at this time?"" he shouted as he left. ""Now I am going to be marked absent for the whole day just because of two minutes."""12-Jun-05,"AFRICA (95%); UNITED STATES (94%); UNITED KINGDOM (93%); SCOTLAND (79%); RWANDA (79%); BURKINA FASO (79%); JAPAN (79%); MOZAMBIQUE (79%); RUSSIAN FEDERATION (79%); ZAMBIA (79%); CANADA (79%); ETHIOPIA (79%); BENIN (79%); SENEGAL (79%); GERMANY (79%); FRANCE (79%); UGANDA (79%); MAURITANIA (79%); MADAGASCAR (79%); NIGER (79%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (79%); GHANA (79%); MALI (79%)","The world's wealthiest nations formally agreed Saturday to cancel at least $40 billion of debt owed to international agencies by the world's poorest lands, most of them in Africa. After late-night talks in London, the finance ministers of the Group of 8 industrialized nations announced that the deal, long in negotiation, had been intended to avoid damaging the ability of international lenders like the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund to continue helping other poor countries. ''This is a historic moment,'' said John W. Snow, the United States Treasury secretary, one of the participants. ''A real milestone has been reached.'' The deal on Saturday was expected to ease the 18 poorest countries' annual debt burden by $1.5 billion. They are Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guyana, Honduras, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. All must take anticorruption measures. Gordon Brown, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, asked at the news conference whether debt relief was also conditional on good government practices by the recipients, said part of the deal was for poor countries to use the money they saved on debt servicing for health, education or the relief of poverty. The agreement came after months of negotiations in which the United States had been pressing the other Group of 8 countries -- Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Japan and Russia -- to agree that the solution to poor countries' indebtedness was to cancel their debt burden completely rather than seek simply to ease it by taking over interest repayments. ''It is my hope today that this reform will conclusively end the destabilizing lend-and-forgive approach to development assistance in low-income countries,'' Mr. Snow said. In the future, he said, ''grants would be used to ensure that countries do not quickly reaccumulate unsustainable debts.'' The agreement, which followed talks in Washington this week between President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, was struck less than four weeks before the Group of 8 leaders hold a summit meeting at Gleneagles, Scotland. Mr. Blair is the current chairman of the Group of 8 and has placed the relief of African poverty along with global warming at the head of an ambitious agenda. Advocacy groups and charities have pressed for a deal on debt relief for years and some welcomed the agreement on Saturday, saying it cleared the way for a broader announcement on combating African poverty at Gleneagles. ''We want a comprehensive breakthrough on more, better development assistance as well as trade reform at Gleneagles and with debt mostly taken care of we can keep up the pressure for a large package,'' said Seth Amgott, a spokesman for a coalition of American charities and advocacy groups called ONE. Some other groups noted that 44 more countries were still burdened by debt to international lenders. Britain is also pressing for a doubling of international aid to Africa, but it is not clear whether that goal will be reached before the Gleneagles summit meeting. Significantly, a statement by the Group of 8 finance ministers did not formally exclude other initiatives to fight poverty, including a tax on airline tickets proposed by France and Germany and a British proposal to raise money for poverty relief on international financial markets. Both of those ideas are opposed by the United States, but their inclusion seemed to be part of a trade-off to secure agreement on the cancellation of debt. Asked about American opposition to an aviation tax on Saturday, Mr. Snow said, ''Our position is the same.'' Mr. Brown said Group of 8 countries had agreed to compensate the World Bank and the African Development Bank in particular for forfeiting interest payments on poor countries' debt, so those groups would have the income to make new loans to other countries. ''We could not contemplate a situation,'' he said, where debt cancellation for some poor countries was made at the expense of other poor countries. The United States agreed to pay up to $1.75 billion in compensation to international lenders over the next 10 years, while Britain agreed to pay up to $960 million. Other Group of 8 countries made their own, undisclosed pledges; more pledges are expected from other members of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund this year. Mr. Brown said the agreement on Saturday would immediately affect some $40 billion in debt, including servicing costs. But the amount it will actually cost the Group of 8 to compensate the international lenders is $16.7 billion -- a calculation based on the payments the international lenders would have expected to receive from 18 debt countries between now and 2015, the officials said. Over all, international lenders are owed some $55.6 billion, Mr. Brown said. The finance ministers said Group of 8 members would compensate the World Bank and the African Development Bank for their losses. But the International Monetary Fund would be able to use ''existing resources'' of its own to cancel the $6 billion it is owed by poor countries. Mr. Snow said this would require ''no use of gold'' -- rebutting proposals by Mr. Brown for the I.M.F. to sell or revalue gold reserves to finance debt cancellation."21-Nov-05,ETHIOPIA (98%); UNITED STATES (94%); AFRICA (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (78%),"Kassa Tadesse does not affiliate with political parties. He is no activist and never has been, he says. But in the past six months, that has changed. Tadesse drove yesterday from his home in Silver Spring to Northwest Washington, where more than a thousand members of the Ethiopian community  gathered to raise money for relatives of people killed or detained during election-related violence in their homeland this month. ""I am just an Ethiopian who is angry about what's going on in my country,"" he said at Washington Hebrew Congregation, where the $50-a-ticket fundraiser  --  a community meeting  --  was held. ""I am here to stand against the present situation. There are mass arrests, killings. People are scared. My relatives are there. Children are scared when they walk to school."" More than 40 people died and thousands were detained this month after demonstrators contested the May 15 election results that favored Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and his ruling party, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front. Medical officials have said police have killed many of the victims; Meles  contends that the opposition groups are responsible for inciting the violence. The groups say the election was rigged, and European Union officials have said the election did not meet international standards. But government officials say the irregularities were not significant enough to have swayed the election. Once before during this year, demonstrations in Ethiopia ended in violence. In June, police shot student protesters in Addis Ababa, the country's capital. Meles has promised an independent inquiry into all the killings. Daniel Abebe said he has no doubt that the election was rigged and that the government has become a dictatorship. ""The facts on the ground are very convincing,"" said Abebe, who drove from Richmond to attend the fundraiser. ""We're not even talking democracy now. It's just basic human rights,"" he said. Ethiopian officials said local protesters have exaggerated claims because of a lack of information. ""Everything is now calm. Everything the government is doing is in accordance with the laws and regulation of that country. That's it,"" said Mesfin Andrias, a spokesman for the Ethiopian Embassy. ""Those who have tried to incite violence, those specific extremists, they are under custody,"" he said. He urged patience while the independent investigation continues. The Washington region is home to one of the largest groups of Ethiopians outside Africa. The 2000 Census recorded at least 15,000 Ethiopian immigrants in the area, although community leaders say the number is much higher. Yesterday's event was their latest effort to call attention to the turmoil in their homeland. On Tuesday, thousands marched from Capitol Hill past the State Department, World Bank and International Monetary Fund buildings to the White House. They urged U.S. officials to pressure Meles to free political prisoners; create an independent judiciary, election board and security force; allow for freedom of the press; and end the violence. Many Ethiopians across the region are watching events in their country with great concern and hope that the local protests will get the U.S. government's attention. ""Over the last two weeks, they have woken from their slumber, and now they are making noise,"" Seyoum Solomon, an economist at the World Bank and member of the Coalition for Unity and Democracy, Ethiopia's leading opposition party, said recently at Addis Ababa, a Silver Spring restaurant. Many of his friends back home are imprisoned or are in hiding, he said, and he calls the U.S. government's support of the current leadership ""an embarrassment."" Seated nearby, Tigist, 25, a Montgomery College student who would not give her last name out of concern for her family in Addis Ababa, said that a friend's cousin was jailed recently. She is worried about her family and friends. ""They have to stop killing innocent people,"" she said."27-Dec-05,CHAD (95%); CENTRAL AFRICA (92%); SUDAN (79%); AFRICA (79%),"Six months after assuming the presidency of the World Bank, Paul D. Wolfowitz is facing his first big test in his new job. An avowed hard-liner on corruption, he must decide whether the bank should wash its hands of one of its most controversial projects, in a country with a notoriously corrupt regime. At issue is a 650-mile pipeline that the World Bank helped finance for Chad, a landlocked central African nation of about 10 million, to transport oil from the country's interior to a coastal port. Despite objections by critics that oil money in such countries is almost invariably squandered or stolen, the bank backed the pipeline in the hope of showing that Africa could use its mineral riches to benefit the poor. It secured an agreement with Chadian leaders that most of the government's oil proceeds would go into a closely supervised escrow fund in London, to be disbursed and invested on the nation's behalf in areas such as education, health and rural development. Now that the oil has been flowing for two years, the wisdom of the bank's gamble is coming under renewed questioning because the government is threatening to unilaterally change the terms of the deal. Out of cash for its regular budget amid mounting security problems involving army deserters and refugees on the border with Sudan, the government announced in October that it intends to amend the law governing the petrodollars so it can use a larger chunk of the money for any purpose it likes, including its security forces. Under the proposed new law, the government would double, to 30 percent, the amount of oil money that it can spend without oversight. The government would also halt the diversion of 10 percent of the oil money into a ""future generations"" fund that is to be spent only after Chad's oil wells run dry. A low point for the bank came several weeks ago after repeated phone calls from Wolfowitz to Chad's president, Idriss Deby, went unreturned, according to bank officials, who said the episode aroused considerable consternation in their ranks. Deby has taken a defiant public stance in response to the bank's protests against the proposed legal changes, declaring last month, ""I will not allow anyone, even if they are a partner, to violate our national sovereignty."" Deepening the bank's woes, its resident representative in Chad, Noel Tshiani, was placed on leave after  allegations of sexual  harassment, according to Chadian press reports that bank officials confirmed only on condition of anonymity because the matter is under investigation. Tshiani declined to respond to e-mails seeking comment. In the past few days, however, the situation has improved slightly  as the government postponed parliamentary action on the legal changes and sent a letter dated Dec. 16 asking the bank to dispatch a high-level mission ""as soon as possible"" to N'Djamena, the capital  --  possibly an olive branch, though bank officials are not sure. All this poses a tough dilemma for Wolfowitz, the former U.S. deputy defense secretary who took the bank's helm last June pledging to put a high priority on intensifying the bank's anti-corruption efforts. The bank has the legal right to take punitive measures in response to any action by the Chadian government to change the agreement, which so far has generated more than $300 million in revenue for public purposes in Chad. The measures could include barring new aid to the country and insisting on immediate repayment of the loans it made for the pipeline. But the bank is instinctively loath to cut off financial ties with a country; it argues that the country's poor are likely to suffer most from the withholding of aid  --  a painful prospect in Chad, one of the world's most impoverished nations, where 80 percent of the population relies on subsistence farming and livestock raising. In Chad's case, a cutoff of bank money raises serious geopolitical concerns as well, because it might increase the risk of a financial collapse for the government that could lead to Chad joining other neighboring countries as a failed state and a haven for terrorists. The cash-strapped government has already fallen into arrears on salary payments to civil servants. Doing the same to the military raises the danger of a bloody coup against Deby, who has ruled Chad since seizing power in 1990. On the other hand, if Wolfowitz is too flexible with Chad, he risks exposing the World Bank and himself to criticism that the fight against corruption is little more than hot air. Chad tied with Bangladesh for the worst corruption rating among nations in the most recent annual survey by Transparency International. The government's cash squeeze suggests that misappropriation of public resources is continuing apace. Normal budget accounting is nonexistent, and bank officials cannot understand how the government can be broke, especially since it has directly received some of the oil money, about $38 million, for its general budget. Allowing the government to take money from the London escrow fund might only invite further waste and would set a terrible precedent for future projects in the oil and mining sector, bank officials fear, by signaling that such ""ring-fencing"" arrangements don't work. So far, Wolfowitz has limited himself to a statement expressing ""serious concern"" about the proposed changes in the law, which ""threaten to undermine the objectives of socio-economic development, poverty reduction, accountability and transparency,"" according to the statement. Bank officials declined to go beyond the statement, or speak on the record at all, citing the delicacy of negotiations with the Chadians. The bank's statement, issued Dec. 8, is viewed as too timid by many antipoverty activists, both inside and outside of Chad. The bank's difficulties, they contend, shows that their doubts about the project were well founded. ""I've tried not to say 'I told you so,' "" said Ian Gary, a policy adviser  for Oxfam America who is a longtime critic of the pipeline. ""We had always feared that the leverage of the World Bank and other donors would decrease substantially once these oil revenues started to flow, and that's what's happening."" ""But there's no good solution right now,"" Gary said, adding that although he thinks the bank should respond very sternly if Chad violates the terms of its agreement, ""I wouldn't want to be in their position."" Chad's finance minister, Abbas Mahamat Tolli, contended in a phone interview that the government has good reason for insisting on changing the agreement. Although world oil prices have roughly doubled since the pipeline deal was signed, the revenue going to the government has been ""disappointing,"" he said, and the government questions the international oil companies' explanation that much of the petroleum being pumped is laden with impurities. ""Relative to our needs for poverty reduction, and the lack of security, the amount of money we are getting is rather small,"" he said. ""We understand that in principle it's good to save for the future. But the people of Chad don't understand why they should be told they must save for future generations when they have needs right now."" Spending money to improve security in the often-lawless countryside, he added, is perfectly consistent with poverty reduction, because ""we can't conceive of economic development in an environment which is not secure."" Bank officials say they are willing to sit down with the Chadians and examine the reasons for the government's cash woes and its increased needs. The bank might accept amendments to the agreement, a staffer said, ""but they have to be arrived at logically, in a structured review process, not just coming out of thin air."" The letter of invitation for the bank to send a mission, which is also addressed to the International Monetary Fund, could provide an opening for a mutually satisfactory compromise. But bank officials are crossing their fingers, because the letter also suggests that the Chadians will stick to their guns. ""[T]he Government of Chad is surprised by the position your two institutions have taken, in which you claim you were not informed by our intention to make changes to the Petroleum Revenue Management Law,"" states the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post. ""We're trying to work through this thing,"" another bank official said. ""We're hoping for further dialogue."""7-Jan-06,CHAD (94%); AFRICA (92%); SUDAN (79%),"World Bank President Paul D. Wolfowitz announced yesterday that he is suspending all of the bank's aid to Chad, taking a hard line in the first major test of his pledge to fight corruption. The move followed a serious setback in a controversial oil pipeline project for Chad that the bank had trumpeted to show how it could help African nations use their natural resource wealth honestly and effectively. In numerous previous instances, such wealth has been squandered or stolen. The bank agreed in 1999 to help finance the 650-mile pipeline, which enables landlocked Chad to export its oil, on the condition that most of the revenue go into a special fund in London to be used for projects such as schools and health clinics benefiting Chad's poor. But the Chadian government recently insisted on taking more of the money for its own purposes, including strengthening its security forces, despite the bank's objections. Wolfowitz said he acted after speaking by phone with Chad's president, Idriss Deby, for 45 minutes Tuesday and two hours Thursday. ""There did not seem to be any movement in their decision to amend the law that was the basis of the 1999 agreement, and until we can come to a better understanding, we have to suspend disbursements on World Bank loans to Chad,"" Wolfowitz said. Wolfowitz emphasized that ""this is not the end of dialogue or the end of negotiations,"" and that ""our actions can be reversed anytime we reach an agreement with Chad."" He voiced sympathy for Deby's complaints that the country has serious security problems from the inflow of refugees from neighboring Sudan, which is riven by civil strife. But especially since the government has yet to satisfactorily explain how it has spent the money thus far, Wolfowitz said, he was obliged to counter Chad's ""breach"" of the pipeline deal. The situation in Chad has presented Wolfowitz with an acute dilemma six months after taking the bank's helm and pledging to put a high priority on the bank's anti-corruption initiatives. Chad tied with Bangladesh for the worst corruption rating among nations in a 2005 survey by Transparency International, an organization that monitors corruption worldwide. Allowing the Deby government more access to unmonitored oil revenue, bank officials fear, would simply lead to more waste. But the bank usually refrains from cutting off loans to countries except in extreme circumstances because the poor in those countries would presumably bear the brunt of the pain. Moreover, Chad presents serious geopolitical concerns; a collapse of the government could cause the country to join some of its neighbors as a failed state and haven for terrorists, a matter about which Wolfowitz, a former deputy secretary of defense, is keenly aware. Under the actions announced yesterday, the bank will freeze about $124 million that was due to be disbursed on projects in Chad over several years, and it will also halt new loans and grants. The bank also had the right to demand accelerated repayment of $41 million that Chad still owes on the pipeline loan, but Wolfowitz did not invoke that penalty. The bank is one of Chad's major sources of support, but the government has received about $300 million annually in recent years in various forms of aid from donors including the U.S. and French governments, the European Union, the African Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Wolfowitz declined to speculate on how other donors may react. ""We're not offering them any recommendations one way or another,"" he said, although he is asking them to prod the Chadian government to take the situation seriously and engage in negotiations. Given the situation on the Sudanese border, he added, ""it may in fact be an argument for, in the right circumstances, some donors considering additional assistance."" Wolfowitz's decision was praised by Ian Gary, a policy adviser for Oxfam America who is a longtime critic of the pipeline. ""The World Bank did what it needed to do,"" he said. He asserted, however, that the debacle shows that the bank should refrain from funding similar projects in the future. ""This has been rightly seen as a major test case of whether World Bank involvement in a project like this could achieve the poverty reduction that we all want to see,"" Gary said. In Chad's capital of N'Djamena, Oil Minister Nasser Mohammed Hassan said the government plans to  issue a statement today , the Associated Press reported."24-Feb-06,CONGO (92%),"THE WORLD Bank's board faces a decision on debt relief today that has broad ramifications for development. The Congo Republic, a small oil state, hopes to win approval of a reduction in its debt , and by some measures it may deserve that. Under the rules governing debt relief, a country whose debt is worth 21/2 times its government revenue qualifies for forgiveness, and a team from the International Monetary Fund has determined that Congo meets this standard. But Congo's corrupt government keeps part of its oil revenue from showing up on its books, raising questions as to whether it deserves forgiveness. The World Bank's president, Paul D. Wolfowitz, rightly argues that debt relief should be delayed. The governments that sit on the bank's board, including African representatives and the Europeans who often support them, should accept Mr. Wolfowitz's position. Congo's efforts to hide oil revenue have been amply documented. The British watchdog group Global Witness has described a network of shell companies established to keep money away from creditors. KPMG, the auditor of Congo's state oil company, has refused to sign off on its accounts three years running. In a memo explaining the finding that Congo met the test for debt relief, the International Monetary Fund concedes that ""oil revenues continue to be diverted for other uses and do not reach the treasury."" Congo's supporters on the World Bank's board argue that the country has met the objective test for debt relief and should not be kept waiting. It's hard to take this seriously. Mr. Wolfowitz's proposed remedy is moderate. He suggests that Congo should adopt measures to reduce oil corruption, a position with which even Congo's defenders concur. But rather than having this trigger an immediate and irrevocable $2 billion worth of debt relief, Mr. Wolfowitz wants Congo to implement the anti-corruption measures for three years before getting full debt reduction. In the meantime, relief would flow into a carefully monitored poverty-reduction fund. This would allow Congo to reap some development benefits while maintaining incentives to fight corruption, at least for three years. Given that Congo is benefiting in the meantime from high oil prices, this hardly seems draconian. The larger issue behind this fight is the seriousness with which donors are willing to take on corruption. Big strides have been made over the past decade in acknowledging that corruption is a problem, but, too often, corrupt countries have been indulged by donors. If Congo's allies on the World Bank's board get their way today, the see-no-evil faction will have won. Better to proceed slowly on Congo  --  and send a needed wake-up call to other corrupt countries."13-Mar-06,"AFRICA (94%); UNITED STATES (92%); IRAQ (92%); UNITED KINGDOM (91%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (79%); CONGO (79%)","Last year was celebrated as the ""Year of Africa."" Tony Blair proposed a doubling of aid to the continent; the world's rich nations promised debt elimination; and the Bush administration talked up its remarkably good record in boosting foreign assistance. But 2006 is shaping up as the year of ""What to do with Africa?"" as donors grapple with the challenge of making aid work. And unless the development institutions demonstrate that they can spend the money effectively, 2007 may be the year in which Africa is once again abandoned. Just look at the Republic of the Congo, a small oil state that lies to the west of the other, bigger Congo, which used to be Zaire. The Congo we're talking about has mountains of debt and canyons of poverty, so it's a candidate for the debt cancellation that was trumpeted last year. But it's also rotten with corruption, rendering most aid efforts pointless. When the matter of Congo's debt relief came before the boards of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund recently, there was a chance to confront this dilemma. Instead, the institutions tried to have it both ways. Last week they acknowledged Congo's corruption but cut the country's debt payments anyway. If the bank and the IMF aren't careful, Congo could emerge as their version of the oil-for-food scandal that discredited the United Nations last year. Congo's oil rogues are in cahoots with some of the same operators who cropped up in the Volcker report on Iraq's oil rip-offs. Both cases make the French establishment look odious. Both involve multilateral institutions whose staffs might want to blow the whistle on corruption but who are discouraged from doing so by political masters in Western capitals. The workings of the Congolese kleptocracy have emerged thanks to three forces: Earlier efforts by the IMF and World Bank to demand transparency; court cases brought by frustrated creditors; and the investigative efforts of Global Witness, a British development group. The star of the story is Denis Gokana, the head of the state oil company, who has arranged for more than $400 million worth of Congo's oil to be sold to shell companies owned by none other than himself, according to British court records. Just as in the Iraq oil scam, these sales were discounted, enabling the shell companies to sell the oil  at a nice profit to firms such as Glencore  --  which, according to the Volcker report, was a leading provider of kickbacks to Saddam Hussein  under the oil-for-food program. Sales at suspiciously low prices were just one method for draining profits from Congo's national oil company and, therefore, from the Congolese people. Gokana's shell companies also lent money to the state oil firm at interest rates higher than 80 percent per year, according to Global Witness. Meanwhile, one of the Gokana firms acquired a tenth of a promising Congolese oil bloc known as Marine XI, at a price that has never been published. The lead investor in Marine XI is a company controlled by an oilman named Patrick Maugein, who also  appears in the Volcker report. Maugein's company is reported to have bid considerably less for the concession than a Canadian rival but won it anyway with what the company describes as the ""best"" offer. Last year Gokana appeared in a British court to answer some of these charges. The judge ruled that his testimony was riddled with lies. The creditor that brought that court case, Kensington International, has also brought a racketeering case in New York, alleging that BNP Paribas, a major French bank, has colluded with Congolese officials to hide oil revenue. BNP was the leading financier of Iraq's oil-for-food deals, and it was accused  in the Volcker report of turning a blind eye to the use of front companies to hide the real identities of  Hussein's oil partners. BNP disputes Kensington's allegations and has described the case as an ""abuse."" Whatever the French bank's role, Congo's corruption appears not to offend the French government, which has led the charge to grant Congo debt relief even though the evidence of its unworthiness has been reported in the French press. In a detailed article in December, the French daily La Tribune explained how millions had been siphoned out of the national oil company and how yet more millions failed to make it from the national oil company to the national treasury. But, as La Tribune noted, President Jacques Chirac and Congo's ruling strongman are old friends. This is a scandal, and it's hard to see why the rich world's taxpayers should tolerate even a hint of debt relief for Congo. Last year the country earned more than $2 billion from oil, or $600 per person; if it spent that money competently, it would not have two-thirds of its people living below the $1-a-day line. But rather than send that message, the World Bank and the IMF have cut Congo's debt payments and held out the hope of outright debt cancellation, provided that the country meets various anti-corruption conditions. In the past, Congo has mocked such conditions. It would probably mock them in the future the day after full debt cancellation went through. Why does this seem likely? Because you don't have to guess what Congo's president thinks of the fight for transparent government. In an interview in February, he dismissed the critics of corruption as ""people who search for lice in the heads of this country's authorities."" smallaby@washpost.com"18-Mar-06,KENYA (97%); UNITED KINGDOM (92%); ENGLAND (90%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%); AFRICA (79%),"THE question that seems to spring to mind in conversation with John Githongo, Kenya's exiled anticorruption czar, is this: Is he some kind of African Lenin -- as some have suggested, and not just because of his goatee -- awaiting the call home to a land on the verge of change? Or is he, as his critics depict him, a man who has betrayed his roots, his class, his ethnicity and his nation by displaying its dirty laundry at a safe range of 4,000 miles? Bluntly put, after exposing Kenyan graft to the highest level with a dossier that has shaken up a government beset by public discontent, is he now in line for the highest office? Does this 40-year-old former journalist want to be president? He is used to the question -- and somewhat coy with the answer. ''Everybody asks me this,'' he said in an interview in a borrowed office at St. Antony's College. He took refuge here last year after fleeing Kenya in part because of concerns about his personal safety as a campaigner against the staggering level of corruption that has long been associated with his East African homeland. ''My actions here have put me in a political realm,'' he said, seeming to choose his words carefully. But, unlike the upper-crust of Kenyan society in which he was raised, ''I have no rural constituency. I have betrayed my entire tribe and the elite around the president -- which still has them spluttering with rage. But then I don't really give a hoot about that. So my attitude is that I'm going to continue here for a while, forcing a change.'' Mr. Githongo has already forced change. Three Kenyan ministers have quit, and the police have seized the passports of officials linked to graft allegations chronicled in a 36-page dossier he compiled after his self-exile. ''It's not over,'' he said. ''It's just starting. Right now about 30 percent has come out.'' But the campaign against corruption has a wider context, he suggested, set in Africa's rapid urbanization, which is destroying its rural traditions, making the continent's teeming, tawdry, tumbledown cities the magnet for a new generation. Mr. Githongo is tall, with the mountainous shoulders of someone who pumps iron as a hobby. That is not the only muscle shielding him; the British police have extended discreet protection for fear his enemies might move against him in the manner of other assaults in the past on high-profile Kenyans. Clad in a gunmetal-gray shirt and black jeans, contemplating the world through steel-rimmed glasses, he said he had been advised to change apartments and vary his routes to work. Yet his manner seems far more casual than such perils suggest. A FORMER investigative journalist and a former head of the Kenya chapter of the anticorruption organization Transparency International, Mr. Githongo was appointed President Mwai Kibaki's chief graft investigator after the new government took power in December 2002. But, he said, he quickly realized that his presence was intended more as an artful ploy to protect the corrupt than as a device to root them out. His father, an accountant who once worked in the office of Jomo Kenyatta, independent Kenya's founding president, is associated with the elite. The family is from the same Kikuyu ethnic background as Mr. Kibaki. Government ministers believed that they could press him into cooperating with them in return for wiping out debt owed by his father, Mr. Githongo said. ''They had been counting on me to do nothing,'' he said. ''People would tell me: 'This is the way things are. It's just the way things are done. We just have to do it with greater finesse, more carefully, than the others.' '' The presence of an anticorruption czar, moreover, was seen by the government as a political necessity. ''Anticorruption wins you votes,'' he said. ''It doesn't mean you necessarily believe it. And it also helps with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank'' and other international donors whose generosity Africa craves. (Sir Edward Clay, Britain's former high commissioner -- or ambassador -- in Kenya recently accused the World Bank of ''feeding the pig of corruption'' by extending $120 million in loans to Kenya just as Mr. Githongo's allegations were surfacing.) ''What's special about Africa's corruption is the starkness of the inequality,'' Mr. Githongo said. ''That is unique -- just how extreme the divide between those who have and those who don't have is.'' And, he said, since ''the method of political mobilization is very often ethnic, tribal, it makes these inequalities combustible.'' In tilting against graft, Mr. Githongo seems to be positioning himself across a far broader front, part of a generational shift among Africans burdened by what he calls the ancestral ties between urban homes and rural roots that bind and, in his view, stymie much of the continent. The bond between town and country has long required those who do well in Africa's cities, in government or business, to spread largess among their clans, families and extended families back home. That encourages graft to feed the expectations of distant kin. But society is changing, Mr. Githongo said. The notion of the village as ''home'' is giving way to the pressures of the slum-fringed cities. ''The age of digging the ground is dying,'' he said. ''That sort of ancestral connection with the land, which is the cause of so many of our problems, is illogical in the modern age.'' With his country's rapid urbanization, ''what were towns are now cities,'' he added. ''The best brains are being sucked into these sprawling, disorganized but very vibrant urban centers. My point of reference is the city.'' He has been struck by the example of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who wrenched modern Turkey from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire in the 1920's. The inference seemed to be that he believed that his own continent would benefit from a similar wrench in an era of shifting points of identity. ''Most Africans are several things at the same time,'' Mr. Githongo continued. His own grandfather, for instance, was baptized as a Roman Catholic by Irish missionaries. Mr. Githongo was born in England before moving to Kenya as an infant. MR. GITHONGO was educated at a prestigious Roman Catholic school in Kenya -- he describes himself still as a practicing Roman Catholic -- but returned to Britain to study philosophy and economics at Swansea University in Wales. He is used to high circles. Since moving to Oxford he has traveled to the United States meeting with, among others, Paul D. Wolfowitz, the head of the World Bank. ''There's a part of you that is rural; there's part of you that's a lawyer or journalist; there's part of you that's ideological in a political way,'' he said. ''Religion has also done well across Africa. And there's no contradiction in all this: you can be a fervent Christian and also a lawyer who has to go back to the village and dispense patronage.'' That has to change, he says. ''Africa has been left behind by Asia and the others. We need to get our act together.''

Wolfowitz, seeking support for his beleaguered leadership as president of the World Bank, is turning for help to the one group at the bank that aides say he has focused on the most, the leaders of sub-Saharan Africa, bank officials say. At a news conference on Saturday, as hundreds of delegates circulated in Washington and speculated about Mr. Wolfowitz's future, several finance ministers of African countries said he had done an outstanding job in increasing aid to Africa and demanding an end to corruption. ''He has been a visionary,'' said Antoinette Sayeh, finance minister of Liberia, which has received considerable bank assistance following its conflicts of a couple years ago. ''We're very grateful for his leadership in getting where we are today. We look forward to that continuing.'' Rama Sithanen, a deputy prime minister of Mauritius, said Mr. Wolfowitz had been ''supportive of the reforms in our country.'' He said Mr. Wolfowitz ''has apologized for what has happened'' regarding the favoritism shown to his companion, Shaha Ali Riza, who is employed at the bank, and should be dealt with in a way that was ''commensurate'' with his mistakes. Mr. Sithanen and two others at the news conference said, however, that they would accept whatever the bank's 24-member board decided about Mr. Wolfowitz's future and assumed that the bank's pro-Africa policies would continue no matter who is leading the institution. At issue is Mr. Wolfowitz's handling of the transfer, promotion and raise of Ms. Riza at the bank when he arrived in 2005. She was detailed to the State Department and given a raise of nearly 50 percent in a manner that the bank's staff association said violated bank rules. The association has called for him to resign. Late Saturday night, in a new effort to appeal to the staff for understanding, Mr. Wolfowitz sent out e-mail messages to all bank employees calling their attention to documents released Friday. The documents show that he made efforts in 2005 to avoid conflicts of interest at the bank over his relationship with Ms. Riza. The bank's board has been considering the matter but members were more involved this weekend in marathon meetings with delegates from 180 countries than with Mr. Wolfowitz's personal problems. Bank officials critical of Mr. Wolfowitz acknowledge that he has concentrated considerable energy on Africa and received praise from African leaders, but they also accuse him of cynically trying to rally Africans dependent on his good will in recent weeks, as criticism of his leadership has mounted. Several bank officials, asking not to be identified in order to avoid reprisals, charged that Mr. Wolfowitz was seeking backing from Africa as a kind of political base to counter the growing resentment among European leaders over his policies, particularly his anticorruption campaign. The bank's board acts as a kind of legislature setting policies as an equal weight with the president, and in some ways Mr. Wolfowitz's time in office has resembled a tug of war between two branches of government. The board usually decides matters by consensus, but its power centers are the United States, Japan and Europe, the largest donors to its $20 billion annual lending and assistance programs. The board is considering Mr. Wolfowitz's future but getting guidance from more than 180 finance ministries around the world. The comments of top officials here indicated most were willing to wait for the board's judgment, but also seemed to accept Mr. Wolfowitz's apology on Thursday. ''I have total confidence in the institution of the bank to handle this issue,'' said Rodrigo de Rato, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, noting that Mr. Wolfowitz had acknowledged his error. Gordon Brown, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, echoed that view, noting that Mr. Wolfowitz had apologized. ''I think we've got to respect the board's process,'' he said. Mr. Wolfowitz held meetings behind the scenes with these ministers and others in town for the annual session sponsored by the bank and the International Monetary Fund. In a reflection of wariness among Europeans, Germany's minister in charge of the World Bank, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, spoke to Reuters and Bloomberg news services of the importance of preserving the bank's ''moral authority'' and suggested that even though Mr. Wolfowitz has apologized, he might need to leave for the good of the bank. ''He has to decide for himself whether he can continue to fulfill his duties credibly under these circumstances,'' Ms. Wieczorek-Zeul said, according to Bloomberg. These comments reflected a sense among many bank officials that the world's finance ministers would be unlikely to force him out, but that a reprimand of some kind might persuade him that his leadership was untenable. On the other hand, Mr. Wolfowitz has churned through meetings this weekend like a man with a mission. Mr. Wolfowitz met Friday with the African members of the bank's board of governors, an aide said, adding that as bank president he has met virtually every day with at least someone involved in African development. Mr. Wolfowitz was instrumental in pushing for a huge debt cancellation plan for poor countries, most of them in Africa, announced by President Bush, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and other Western leaders at a 2005 summit meeting in Gleneagles, Scotland, attended by the singer Bono and other celebrities. Although he has also imposed temporary aid cutoffs to Africa on grounds of corruption, angering European aid officials who felt they were not consulted, he has also won friends among many African countries for preaching accountability in government. At a meeting on Thursday at which he was booed by bank employees, Mr. Wolfowitz appealed to the hostile crowd to work with him on the bank's real priorities, singling out Africa. A few weeks ago, Mr. Wolfowitz held a ''town hall'' session in the bank's atrium wearing a shirt he had obtained on the most recent of his four trips to Africa as bank president. A slogan on the shirt read, in French, ''No to impunity for violence against women, yes to justice.'' The session was to introduce a new vice president for Africa, Oby Ezekwesili, a former minister in Nigeria, who praised Mr. Wolfowitz and drew applause from the crowd."12-Jul-07,NIGERIA (92%); ZAMBIA (79%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%),"Tyler Cowen is professor of economics at George Mason University and author of the forthcoming ''Discover Your Inner Economist: Use Incentives to Fall in Love, Survive Your Next Meeting, and Motivate Your Dentist.''  It is unfortunate that economists have to debate whether natural resources are a blessing or a curse for a developing nation. Minerals, diamonds or oil may appear to represent automatic wealth but resource-rich countries usually become mired in corruption. High oil revenues, for instance, allow a government to maintain power and reward political supporters without doing much for its people. The government of Nigeria has taken in billions from high oil prices, yet the average person was probably better off 40 years ago. The easy-to-reach wealth of a resource also encourages coups, and thus political stability is problematic. The solution is to make these governments more accountable in spending their money, but how can that be done? Paul Collier, an economics professor at Oxford University, has a new and potentially powerful idea. In his recently published book, ''The Bottom Billion: Why the Poorest Countries Are Failing and What Can Be Done About It'' (Oxford University Press), Professor Collier favors an international charter -- some widely publicized guidelines that countries can voluntarily adopt -- to give transparency in spending wealth from natural resources. A country would pledge to have formal audits of its revenues and their disposition. Imagine PricewaterhouseCoopers auditing the copper revenues of Zambia and issuing a public report. Professor Collier's proposal at first glance seems toothless; a truly corrupt country probably wouldn't follow the provisions of the charter, which, after all, is voluntary. Yet citizens could pressure their government to follow such a charter, and the idea of the charter would create a focus for political opposition and signify international support for concrete reform. Foreign corporations would bring further pressures to heed the charter. Multinational companies that are active in corrupt countries might receive bad domestic publicity. Eventually the companies might push for adherence to the charter, even if the charter limited their ability to bribe. In another context, De Beers has been stung by bad publicity about ''blood diamonds,'' and the company is now a force for positive change where it operates. In the optimistic case, a few poor countries start abiding by the charter. Those countries prosper and attract more investment and status in the international community. The pressure to adopt the charter would then spread. Of course, promoting the charter costs relatively little and the potential benefits are significant. International pressures did eventually force a change in South African apartheid. So maybe they can improve other countries as well. Revenue audits would limit politicians' ability to rake off funds for personal use or take bribes to give foreign companies a sweetheart deal. As it stands now, citizens of poor countries usually have no idea how much natural resource wealth is being generated or where that money is going. Accounting for natural resource revenues would also help poor countries plan for the future. Many poor exporting nations ride their fortunes up and down with the price of oil or other resources. Ideally, these countries should be setting funds aside when the price of their resource is high. But, of course, no one will save money that will be stolen by others. Secure and audited funds can enable better planning for hard economic times. The British government has already made one start toward a natural resources charter with its Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, begun in 2002. The World Bank has supported this idea and we need only imagine further waves of publicity, more active involvement from the International Monetary Fund and stronger interest from aid organizations and other nongovernmental organizations. Even more promising is that Nigeria, one of the most corrupt countries, enacted a revenue transparency provision into law, as of May 28. The new Nigerian law relies too heavily on the federal government to monitor revenues, thereby reminding us of the old adage about the fox and the henhouse. Nonetheless, state governors opposed the measure strongly, which is a sign it may prove to have teeth. Furthermore, Nigeria did allow an audit by a private company in 2006, and it allowed the significant discrepancies to be publicized. The country may or may not turn the corner, but there are pressures building for greater rule of law. In general, transparency can improve governance. A World Bank working paper written in 1999 by Christos Kostopoulos, ''Progress in Public Expenditure Management in Africa,'' found that many African countries improved their management of public spending in the 1990s. Openness can, in fact, break the links among corruption, secrecy and lack of accountability. Professor Collier notes that in Uganda only 20 percent of the money from one educational program actually reached the schools. One Ugandan bureaucrat publicized the allocations to both the news media and to the schools, and eventually 90 percent of the money flowed to the schools. Simply sending more foreign aid backfires when leaders are corrupt and governance is bad. And Western governments are not willing to send enough aid to make a big difference. Revenue transparency is not an immediate fix, but it would increase the productivity of both Western aid and Western trade. Workable development ideas are hard to find, but Professor Collier may have identified the next frontier for positive change."13-Aug-07,CHAD (99%); AFRICA (98%); CHINA (96%); COTE D'IVOIRE (92%); FRANCE (90%); ANGOLA (79%); GUINEA (79%); NIGERIA (79%),"The small plane flew in low over a scorched, peppercorn scrubland, following a broad, muddy river that was all elbows on its run to the southeast. The first hint of humanity came with the appearance of an immense grid for seismic testing, laboriously traced through the brush. Finally, a lonely, hulking steel drilling platform popped into view. Chad is as geographically isolated as places come in Africa. It is also among the continent's poorest and least stable countries, the scene of recurrent civil wars and foreign invasions since it gained independence from France in 1960. None of that has put off the Chinese, though. In January, they bought the rights to a vast  exploration zone that surrounds this rural village, making the  baked wilderness here, without roads, electricity or telephones,  the latest frontier for their thirsty oil industry and increasingly global ambitions. The same is happening in one African country after another. In large oil-exporting countries like Angola and Nigeria, China is building or fixing railroads, and landing giant exploration contracts in Congo and Guinea. In mineral-rich countries that had been all but abandoned by foreign investors because of unrest and corruption, Chinese companies are reviving output of cobalt and bauxite. China has even become the new mover and shaker in agricultural countries like Ivory Coast, once the crown jewel in France's postcolonial African empire, where Chinese companies are building a new capital, in Yamoussoukro, paid for by Chinese loans. Surging Chinese interest in this continent has helped bring about what many Africans believe is the most important moment since the end of the cold war, when democracy was spreading in Africa and Western nations spoke of a ''peace dividend'' that might ease African poverty. That blush of interest in Africa quickly faded, though, as did several of the new democracies, and Africans and Westerners have regarded each other warily ever since. Westerners complain about chronic corruption and ineffective government, while Africans lament broken promises on aid and a hostile international economic system. The Chinese have stepped into this picture, coming to struggling countries  like Chad with deep pockets, fewer demands on how African governments should behave and an avowed faith in everyone's ability to prosper. As Beijing's ambassador to this country, Wang Yingwu, said at his residence in Ndjamena, Chad's capital, where the electricity repeatedly failed, ''We are exempting Chadian goods from import duties.'' When the interviewer noted that Chad produced almost nothing besides oil, Mr. Wang was undaunted, saying, ''If they don't produce things today, they will tomorrow.'' To help make that happen, China plans to build the country's first oil refinery, lay new roads, provide irrigation and erect a mobile telephone network, for starters. With such intensive efforts across the continent, China's trade with Africa topped $55 billion in 2006, up from less than $10 million in the 1980s. To achieve this growth, it has bypassed multinational institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and flouted many of their lending criteria, including minimum standards of transparency, open bidding for contracts, environmental impact studies and assessments of overall debt and fiscal policies. In some ways, the new Chinese model of doing business in Africa is a throwback to an earlier era of Western involvement that is now widely seen as disastrous. In that era, borrowing countries typically had to work with companies from the lending nation, limiting competition and giving priority to business over development. Today, China takes things even further, signing long-term deals for rights to natural resources that allow countries otherwise unworthy of credit to repay their debt in oil or mineral output. ''In what manner has Africa progressed, in what sector?'' said the Chadian president, Idriss Deby, referring to decades of close ties to the West. ''Whatever the good will of Africa's old friends and the old partners in its development, it has not progressed at all.'' Still, major doubts hang heavily in the air. Will China's hunger for raw materials enable this continent to take off? Or will Beijing's willingness to spend  whatever it needs in Africa, without regard to fiscal prudence, democracy, honest business practices  and human rights, produce a replay of booms past, enriching local elites but leaving the continent poorer, its environment despoiled and its natural resources depleted? A Test Case for China There are few better places than Chad to watch for signs of how China's African gambit will pay off. Chad ranks just four places from the bottom on the United Nations scale of human development, yet it is emerging as a critical piece in China's economic push in a broad swath of sub-Saharan Africa, beginning with Sudan and extending in virtually every direction. Despite  advanced prospecting by French and other Western firms dating back to the 1970s, Chad's oil had never been tapped. The nation was simply too unstable and the price of oil too low to justify investing much here. The oil that had been found was of low quality, and there was no practical way to get it out. That changed in 2000, when the World Bank agreed to help finance a $4.2 billion, 665-mile pipeline connecting Chad to Cameroon on the condition that oil revenues be used to fight poverty. Chad's revenues quickly outstripped expectations, but have not gone into quelling its immense poverty. Mismanagement and fraud have beset the World Bank plan from the start. Beyond that, Chadian rebels with bases in Sudan have been trying  to depose Mr. Deby, so he pressed the World Bank to relax its rules on how to spend the country's oil money. A compromise  was reached, and he went on a military spending spree, buying guns, aircraft and armored vehicles for his troops, along with a fleet of armored Humvees that stop  traffic as they zoom about Ndjamena's dusty, potholed streets. Seeking an even freer hand with the country's oil bonanza, Mr. Deby's government also  hinted that it could find other partners willing to invest in Chad, especially with the price of oil so high. Then, in 2006, Chad ended a relationship with Taiwan and  recognized mainland China, and the floodgates opened. China bought the rights to several oil exploration zones in the country from a Canadian company and has gone from bit player to center stage in  Chad's affairs, confident that it can wring smart profits from the most inhospitable conditions. ''The Canadians and the Americans are only interested in really big finds,'' said a veteran Western oil production engineer who works under contract here for the China National Petroleum Company,  the  C.N.P.C. ''Anything else they think is not worth their time. The Chinese have a different approach. They are happy with the smaller finds, just lots of them.  ''They seem to have a different time frame, too,'' the engineer added. ''They plan to be here for a while.'' Indeed, the Chinese dream in this region consists of making finds here and there, using the World Bank financed pipeline to transport the oil and eventually building new pipelines to connect with a Chinese-built grid in Sudan. This vision requires not only finding more oil, but establishing peace between Chad and Sudan.  Darfur, the chaotic western Sudanese region where at least 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million been displaced in a government-backed counterinsurgency campaign, lies next to China's  exploration zones.Human rights groups maintain that Chinese weapons have played a major role in the  carnage in Darfur. Beijing's recent diplomatic activity in the region may be explained by these Chinese oil interests as much as by American pressure on China to help stop the killing in Darfur. ''It used to be that when we had problems with our neighbor sending mercenaries to invade us that none of our complaints before the United Nations would pass, because China blocked them,'' said President Deby. Since breaking relations with Taiwan and opening the door to Chinese investment, he added, ''we have been able to raise our concerns without taboo.'' One topic that neither side was willing to say much about was the World Bank's foundering efforts to ensure that petroleum revenues were well spent here.  ''I know the current pipeline is part of a project involving the World Bank and Esso,'' said Dou Lirong, the general manager of C.N.P.C. International in Chad, calling the authority over revenues ''a very complicated'' matter. ''I don't know too much about it,'' Mr. Dou continued, ''but I've read a little bit on the Web.'' In fact, the very idea of the World Bank project is anathema to China's deeply held noninterference policy, which has for decades governed China's foreign policy and development. Underlying both is a kind of golden rule -- China considers other countries meddling in its affairs unacceptable, and it assumes its friends feel the same way. Cao Zhongming, deputy director of the Department of African Affairs, in the Chinese Foreign Ministry said: ''China won't interfere with Chad's internal affairs. As a policy, that doesn't change. If C.N.P.C., World Bank and Chad reach an agreement, it's between them.'' But, he added, if Chad does not accept the World Bank arrangement, ''neither C.N.P.C. or the Chinese government would impose it.'' ''The Chinese government,'' he said, ''won't enforce something that Chad thinks interferes with their internal affairs.'' To China's new African allies, this notion is a breath of fresh air. After years of hewing to the latest fads in international development doled out by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, Western donors and the United Nations, African governments have grown weary of the strings attached to foreign aid. Therese Mekombe, vice chairwoman of the committee that monitors Chad's oil money to make sure it is used properly, expressed surprise about the Chinese executive's uncertainty about how oil revenues would be handled. Brandishing a copy of the law, she said all of the country's oil earnings fell under the control of the World Bank arrangement. ''The Chinese need to understand that they cannot arrive in a country and just impose their way of thinking,'' Ms. Mekombe said. A 'Win-Win' Business Plan Chinese officials almost invariably describe their relationship with African countries as a win-win -- based on mutual respect, aimed at joint prosperity and free of the overtones of exploitation and paternalism that critics worldwide say have governed much of the West's postcolonial relationship with Africa. China plans to build a petroleum refinery and a cement factory in Chad, both desperately needed in a landlocked country forced to import basic goods. Indeed, lowering gas and cement prices, which are among the highest in Africa, could do more to reduce poverty than the efforts of the World Bank and other donors combined, Mr.  Dou suggested.  ''We can make a contribution to Chad,'' he  said. Asked for an example of what  win-win relationships look like, Mr. Dou offered what might seem an unlikely choice: Sudan. In its capital, Khartoum, he said, signs of China's impact are everywhere. ''If you go to Sudan, you see paved roads,'' he said. In the past, ''the cars in Sudan had no turn signals, they point directions by hand. Now there are many good cars.'' Asked whether the oil money was really benefiting the Sudanese people, not just their rulers, Mr.  Dou replied: ''It is difficult for me to say. I am an engineer.'' To some critics, the answer is clear. ''China's no-strings-attached approach is problematic, particularly if its effect, if not its intent, is to undermine others' efforts to change situations on the ground,'' said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. ''Often what is happening,'' he added, ''is underwriting of repression.'' Few Benefits for the People Even with binding arrangements governing the use of oil revenues, Chad's people have largely missed out. In the Mayo-Kebbi  region, where much of China's feverish oil exploration is happening, the city of Bongor hardly looks like the capital of the booming oil region it is set to become. Along its tree-fringed main avenue, the briskest business is  preparing  the city's signature dish -- a chicken so scrawny it can be grilled whole in a few minutes. At the lone hospital, a moldering colonial-era structure, a handful of workers tended to dozens of patients suffering from the classic ailments of poverty: hunger, diarrhea, malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS, pneumonia. Civil servants were on strike, seeking to force the government, which according to World Bank estimates will collect $1.2 billion in oil money this year, to increase their meager salaries. Pauline Maratangou, a 53-year-old midwife, did show up to work, and it was a good thing. Half a dozen pregnant women with bellies fit to burst patiently awaited her services. ''Vas-y, vas-y, vas-y!'' she cooed, urging an 18-year-old mother to push. The maternity ward had only a padded bench for deliveries and no stirrups. The floors and walls were caked with dirt -- the orderlies were on strike. Ms. Maratangou worked with quick, efficient motions, pouring iodine over the crown of the baby's head as it emerged, trying to keep mother and child free of infection. At last a little boy popped out, his head slightly misshapen, like a peanut shell. ''Ah, he's a handsome boy,'' she said, holding him aloft, feet first, waiting for his first bellowing cries. There was only time to snip his umbilical cord, weigh him -- five and a half  pounds, not too bad for this part of the world -- and swaddle him in rags before the next mother, also 18, was ready to hop on the table still slick with afterbirth slime. The grim conditions help explain why Chad has among the highest maternal and infant mortality rates in the world. One of every five children will die before age 5. ''We hear that our country has oil, but we see no evidence of it here,'' said Ms. Maratangou, the midwife. Officials in Bongor say money from Chinese investments could fix schools and hospitals, or provide jobs and new roads. Under Chadian law, 5 percent of the oil revenue is supposed to go back to the community where the oil was drilled. ''We have very high hopes,'' said Khalifa Malloum, the secretary general of Bongor's regional government. ''If the West does not want to invest in us, let the Chinese come. We welcome them. They don't tell us what to do and they bring development. They are good partners.'' But Limassou Saleh, a community organizer in Bongor, said he was deeply skeptical.   ''Chad is maybe the most corrupt country in the world,'' Mr. Saleh said. ''We have a long history of human rights violations, of lack of transparency, of exploitation. China has a reputation for corruption. They are one of the worst human rights abusers. They have no record of transparency. What would we want with a country like that? Only to make our own problems worse.''"21-Oct-07,AFRICA (98%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (94%); CHINA (79%); ASIA (79%); EASTERN ASIA (79%); INDIA (79%); ZIMBABWE (79%),"The economies of sub-Saharan Africa, home to some of the most extreme and pervasive poverty in the world, will grow at a healthy pace next year, International Monetary Fund economists said yesterday. The news came at the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank this weekend, where leaders of the latter group are trying to raise money to fight poverty on the continent -- and grappling with the difficulty of trying to help some of the world's poorest people, many of whom live in countries with considerably corrupt governance. The fund's projections have African nations growing more slowly than emerging East Asia, but on the right track; its economists expect 6 percent growth in total output forecast this year and nearly 7 percent growth in 2008. Inflation has been contained across most of Africa, excluding Zimbabwe (where there has been hyperinflation recently), according to the fund's annual regional economic outlook, released yesterday. ""African economic policies are far better than in the past,"" Abdoulaye Bio-Tchan, African development director of the IMF, said of the improvement. ""Deficits are going down, inflation is going down, and as I suggested, the growth rate is picking up based on those strong policies."" Robert B. Zoellick, president of the World Bank, is trying to raise nearly $40 billion over the coming months for a fund that will pay for development projects for the world's 81 poorest nations, most of them in Africa. But raising the money is likely to be challenging. Many nations are facing tight budgets and wish to control their aid activities themselves rather than turn money over to the World Bank as an intermediary. Developing countries such as China and India are home to hundreds of millions of very poor individuals, but those countries can handily raise money for development projects through private capital. The countries that don't have access to private capital markets and thus most need help from an organization like the World Bank tend to have unstable or corrupt governments. But donors are wary of funding projects in which big chunks of the money may get siphoned off. Zoellick's predecessor, Paul D. Wolfowitz, made fighting corruption his top priority, and an outside commission chaired by former Federal Reserve chairman Paul A. Volcker recommended an overhaul of the World Bank's fraud-fighting unit in a report last month. Zoellick said last week that  the bank's role must go beyond financing roads, dams and other infrastructure. ""Many people think that our role is just the traditional World Bank of the '60s, of project finance,"" he said. ""Our real role is helping to create the markets, the intermediation, the institutions, so these things go on long beyond us."" There is little that the World Bank can do for regimes that are corrupt at the very top, said Raymond Fisman, a Columbia University economist who studies corruption. ""If the top guy in the country isn't buying into it, there's not much hope,"" he said. ""But if there is genuine interest in reform, the World Bank can play a very good role in figuring out how best to implement anti-corruption reform."" Nigeria offers an example of the challenge. A major oil exporter, the nation has been enriched in recent years by high energy prices. The IMF said yesterday that it expects the Nigerian economy to grow 8 percent next year. But it also has a legacy of being one of the most corrupt nations in the world, under a succession of military leaders. (It now is controlled by civilians). Even if the IMF growth projection is correct, its gross domestic product per person would be only $1,136, and about 35 percent of its population lived in extreme poverty in 2004. Transparency International, a nonprofit organization, ranks Nigeria the 32nd most corrupt nation out of 180, with officials routinely requiring bribes in exchange for routine public services. Speaking to reporters yesterday, Nigerian Finance Minister Shamsuddeen Usman said that the nation has made steady progress eradicating corruption. For example, he said, he and other leaders are now publicly disclosing their assets, a check against bribes and the siphoning of oil wealth. ""I think the issue of corruption is becoming less and less,"" Usman said. Then, slightly misstating the nation's corruption ranking from Transparency International, he said, ""Our last rating was that we were the 38th most corrupt nation. That is still 37 steps better than when we were ranked the most corrupt."""10-Dec-07,CONGO (95%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%),"The main teaching hospital here is in such disrepair that many patients have to pay freelance porters for piggyback rides up and down the stairs to get X-rays. It costs $2 a flight, each way. But why is the hospital, like so much of the Congo Republic, so tattered when the country sells billions of dollars of oil each year? The government says it is still recovering from a devastating war and faces a new problem: Western investors, sensing a chance to rake in millions, are suing to recover old debts that they bought for pennies on the dollar. Such investors, running what critics derisively call vulture funds, have been widely denounced by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for forcing poor countries to fend off costly lawsuits rather than build classrooms and clinics. But in the Congo Republic, where a deep-seated culture of graft has squandered so much of the nation's wealth, those investors have become unexpected allies of anticorruption campaigners, who say such lawsuits may be the only way of holding the country accountable for how it spends its money. ''We ask ourselves, why is our country like this?'' said Dr. Bebene Bondzouzi-Ndamba, a neurologist at the hospital. ''Why are we so rich and yet so poor?'' Her questions have come into sharp relief in the fight between the Congo Republic and an affiliate of an American hedge fund, Elliott Associates. For an undisclosed price, the company bought about $31 million in debt that the country took on in the 1980s but later defaulted on. Now it is suing in American, European and Asian courts to collect the principal plus interest and penalties -- more than $100 million in all. So far, it has collected $39 million. Advocates of canceling third world debt recoil at such cases, with some calling for a code of conduct among lenders to prevent them from selling unpaid debts to investors. ''I deplore the activities of so-called vulture funds that seek to profit from the debts owed by the poorest countries,'' Gordon Brown said in May, the month before he became prime minister of Britain. ''I am determined to limit the damage done by such funds.'' But organizations that fight corruption argue that those investors are exposing in court the corrupt networks of government officials, providing a much-needed check on mineral-rich states. Beyond that, anticorruption campaigners, like the groups Global Witness and the Publish What You Pay Coalition, contend that when nations win debt relief without becoming more accountable, they will simply repeat old mistakes and end up deep in debt once again. ''If it were not for these vulture funds, we would not know any facts about the way our country's wealth is being taken away,'' said Brice Mackosso, a campaigner for greater transparency in the Congo Republic's government. ''We don't agree with their ultimate aims, but they are the only ones capable of exposing the truth.'' Critics argue that virtually all countries use their debt relief savings to help the poor, and that so-called vulture funds achieve outsize returns from long-forgotten debts at the expense of the world's poorest people. Cutting Both Ways While investor lawsuits may expose nefarious dealings, they may also make governments more secretive to avoid asset seizures.  ''It can cut both ways,'' said Mark Thomas, a senior economist at the World Bank. ''It can be a cause of revealing nontransparent practices, but it can also be a cause of those nontransparent practices in the first place.'' Debts are bought and sold all the time, and Western courts have awarded hundreds of millions of dollars in judgments to debt investors. Peru is the best-known example: In 2000, Elliott Associates, whose founder, Paul E. Singer, is a top Republican donor and a backer of Rudolph W. Giuliani's presidential campaign, won a $58 million judgment on debt it had bought in 1996 for $20 million. Now African countries are in the sights of debt investors. In 1979, Zambia borrowed $15 million from Romania to buy agricultural equipment. Twenty years later, the two governments agreed to settle the old debt for about $3 million. But a hedge fund, Donegal International, bought it first and sued for about $55 million. This year, a British court ruled that Zambia must pay Donegal $15 million. The plight of Zambia, a poor country stricken by AIDS, raised awareness of so-called vulture investing in Africa, and debt relief campaigners, celebrities and some members of the Bush administration have taken up the issue. Most creditors go along with debt reduction or write-off deals, and the Congo Republic has qualified under international programs for a reduction of much of the $8.5 million in debt it owed as of December  2004. Government officials here point to a slew of new projects under construction, like a hydroelectric dam, hundreds of miles of new roads and an emergency power plant as evidence that they are rebuilding the country. A June report from the I.M.F. noted that at least some progress has been made to address ''corruption and weak governance.'' Still, half the nation's population lacks access to clean water, according to Unicef. The lifetime risk of dying in childbirth for  women in the Congo Republic is 1 in 26, one of the world's highest rates. Life expectancy is just 53 years, down from 55 in 1990. That deprivation exists despite the significant amount of oil the country produces relative to its  3.8 million people -- 250,000 barrels a day. The litigation surrounding the country has unearthed a complex web of questionable practices that may have stripped untold millions of that oil money from the nation's treasury since 1997. Defense From Creditors In interviews,  officials here said the purpose of their complex transactions -- which, according to court documents, included discounted prices for well-connected companies -- was to avoid what it viewed as overzealous creditors. ''We are in a war, and we have to defend ourselves,'' said Alain Akouala, the Congo Republic's information minister. But the group Global Witness has seized on court records to tease out these connections between government officials, private companies and a French bank that set up oil transactions. The litigation has also exposed the free-spending habits of government officials. According to hotel bills, the country's president, Denis Sassou-Nguesso, paid $8,500 a night for a triplex suite at the New York Palace Hotel during a visit to the United Nations in 2005. His hotel bills in the United States in 2005 and 2006 added up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Officials here said that Mr. Sassou-Nguesso was simply staying in the same type of hotels as other heads of state. Another embarrassing find was the credit card bills of one of the president's sons, Denis Christel Sassou-Nguesso, who runs the marketing arm of the Congo Republic's state oil business, Cotrade. They showed large purchases from shops like Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton and Gucci, and a paper trail suggesting that companies receiving state oil business had paid for the purchases, Global Witness said. The world of luxury implied by those credit card bills is emblematic of the vast gap between the country's elite and its impoverished masses. The Congo Republic's main teaching hospital may be in terrible shape, but its director, Ignace Ngakala, works in a plush office outfitted with a large, lacquered wood desk and a high-backed leather chair. His office, he said, was recently renovated along with the delivery room in the maternity ward and a meeting room for medical conferences, complete with a state-of-the-art sound system. In his parking space sat a late-model Volkswagen sport utility vehicle that sells for about $50,000 in the United States. ''We are coming from war,'' he said, explaining why the elevator in one of the hospital buildings was not fixed. ''We are in the middle of a progressive renovation.'' Mr. Sassou-Nguesso, the president, first ruled the country as a Marxist-Leninist dictator, from 1979 to 1992, then seized power again in 1997. A brutal civil war followed, devastating the country. He was elected president in 2002, but the vote was deeply flawed because his main rivals were excluded, international observers say. Mr. Sassou-Nguesso's government has jettisoned its Communist past in favor of petro-capitalism. But aides say that the image of a free-spending kleptocrat is false, noting that here in the capital the president stays in the same modest home he has lived in since he was an army lieutenant. But in Pointe-Noire, the center of the Congo Republic's booming oil industry, Mr. Sassou-Nguesso lives in a sprawling oceanfront mansion. At a reception there in October, government ministers drank single-malt Scotch by the swimming pool, while Mr. Sassou-Nguesso sipped Champagne from a cut-crystal glass. In an interview, Mr. Sassou-Nguesso said his government was committed to transparency and posts oil revenues on a Web site. It also submits to independent audits, as requested by the International Monetary Fund. Both Sides Point Fingers He criticized as immoral the private creditors seeking to gain from the Congo Republic's misery, and rejected the notion that debt investors could play a positive role in exposing corruption. ''Vulture funds cannot give us lessons,'' he said. In a statement, Elliott Associates said it could not be blamed for the Congo Republic's problems. ''The poor in developing countries are poor because the political and economic systems in their countries have failed them,'' the statement said. According to Justice Department records, the Congo Republic's  government has spent $3.3 million  this year and last to hire lobbyists and lawyers to press its cause in Congress and in the news media, including the firms of Washington heavyweights like Plato Cacheris and Bob Livingston. Their efforts have borne some fruit in the form of Congressional hearings on the impact of debt investors, and news articles about Mr. Singer's contributions to Mr. Giuliani's presidential campaign. Caught in the middle of this fight are schoolchildren, like 10-year-old Laurent Mbemba in Pointe-Noire. His school has 3,583 students. Its three latrines are broken. Many teachers have not been paid in years -- they get by on donations from parents. Rain pours in thundering sheets onto the tin roof, dribbling through rust holes onto the children beneath. The classrooms are so packed -- as many as 200 a class -- that many children sit on the cement floor, notebooks perched on their narrow thighs. ''There aren't enough desks for everyone,'' Laurent said. The school's principal, Martial Itsouhou, said the school received virtually no assistance from the government. ''Our country exports wood, but we have no desks,'' Mr. Itsouhou said. ''Our children are literally learning on their knees. We don't know where the money goes. We just pray for help.''"9-Apr-09,"AFRICA (98%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (93%); GHANA (93%); LIBERIA (93%); MOZAMBIQUE (92%); SUDAN (92%); SOMALIA (92%); ZIMBABWE (92%); RWANDA (79%); ETHIOPIA (79%); UNITED STATES (79%)","For more than a decade, much of Africa has been moving forward. Economic growth is rising, poverty is falling and democratic governance is spreading. But the global financial crisis threatens to undo this progress by reducing investment, exports and aid just as they should be expanding to build on these successes. While international attention has been understandably focused on events in Darfur, Somalia and Zimbabwe, countries across the continent including Ghana, Tanzania, Mozambique and Liberia have been quietly turning around. Economic growth rates regularly exceed 5 percent in many nations. Since 2000, 34 million more African children are in school. More than 2 million Africans are on lifesaving HIV/AIDS medicines. Malaria deaths have been halved in Rwanda and Ethiopia, and the disease has been virtually eradicated in Zanzibar. Poverty rates are falling fast, from 58 to 51 percent across the continent in just six years, according to the World Bank. The key to this progress is stronger African leadership and more accountable governance. Today, more than 20 African countries are democracies, up from just three in the 1980s; they have competitive elections and improved human rights, and their news media are much freer. These efforts have been supported by increasingly effective development assistance from the United States and other partners. Consider what has happened in my country, Liberia. After 14 years of devastating war, we faced enormous challenges but had precious few resources. Our democratically elected government has worked with international partners and a growing number of private investors to turn things around. In the past three years, we have doubled primary school enrollment nationwide, refurbished hundreds of health facilities, and begun rebuilding roads and generators. We have taken steps to root out corruption and remove unscrupulous officials. Growth has exceeded 8 percent per year. And, most critical, we are at peace. We are restoring our once-vibrant nation, and the crucial component -- hope -- has already been revived. Without international support, we would not have made this progress and would be at much greater risk of returning to war. The economic crisis threatens the progress in my country and elsewhere on our continent. An estimated $50 billion in income could be lost in Africa during the next two years. Declining remittances, trade flows and investment could undermine new businesses, throw millions out of work, and increase tensions and instability. The crisis -- which Africa did nothing to cause -- demands a strong response. African nations must do their part by continuing to address corruption, eliminate red tape and reduce obstacles to private-sector growth. But just as industrialized countries need a stimulus, African economies need a boost to keep their progress on track. The Group of 20 meeting last week produced a helpful first step. Going forward, five additional steps are critical. First, the G-20 pledge to provide the International Monetary Fund with new resources must be fulfilled, and the IMF needs to get those resources to countries quickly and without onerous conditions. Second, the World Bank and the African Development Bank must better leverage their resources; aggressively front-load support; and better target growth, jobs and safety-net programs. The International Finance Corp., the World Bank's private-sector affiliate, must be especially creative in keeping private investment on track. Third, bilateral partners must build on their promises to increase aid and make it more effective by reducing bureaucratic delays, speeding disbursements and better aligning programs with African priorities. Fourth, export credit agencies must use their resources to attack risk and other barriers to trade finance, such as liquidity issues. Fifth, all countries must resist protectionist pressures so that trade can  be the critical engine for restoring global growth. The citizens and leaders of donor nations should recognize how important their assistance has been to the new leadership in Africa and how appreciative most Africans are for this partnership. Critics say that African economies are shrinking, that poverty is rising and that failing aid is the culprit. But this argument is at least a decade out of date. Africa's turnaround is real, the evidence indisputable. Africans themselves have been the key to this reversal, but more effective aid has played an important role. Reducing aid would slow private-sector growth, stall poverty reduction, and undermine peace and stability in countries that are struggling to become part of the global economy. It would be a cruel irony if, just as Africa began to succeed, its prospects were cut short by a crisis beyond its control. Strong action by African governments and robust support from the international community can keep Africa's recovery on track. Both should continue to do their part.

He is the author of ''In the Land of Magic Soldiers: A Story of White and Black in West Africa.''  ''Tell them to stop leaning on the fence!'' Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, president of Liberia and the first woman ever elected head of state on the continent of Africa, ordered the leader of her security team. We were driving along one of the scarce paved avenues in her nation's capital, Monrovia. With her convoy rode United Nations gunmen, part of a peacekeeping force of 10,000 charged with preventing a conflagration in the aftermath of 14 years of horrific civil war. The fighting ended in 2003, but outside the windows of Sirleaf's S.U.V., the skeletons of abandoned buildings and the cries, at once thrilled and desperate, of the onlookers along the president's route were signs of the country's position near last on any list of how well the world's nations are functioning. Yet Sirleaf's attention narrowed on a bit of black iron railing and a cluster of leaning teenage boys. The simple, wilting fence -- a rare adornment on the avenue's median and a hint of order in a city still reeling from war's anarchy -- looked close to collapse. The 71-year-old president's focus, always exacting, grew fierce. ''Tell them to stop,'' she repeated in her scratchy voice. She meant for her security man to radio back to someone else in the convoy to scold and scatter the boys. It seemed she would have rather done the scolding herself. Below her purple, geometrically patterned head wrap of African cloth, severe grandmotherly disapproval seized her face. ''They will break that fence!'' Sirleaf, who beat a Liberian soccer star, George Weah, to win the presidency in 2005, and who has announced that she will run for a second term next year, is seen as a figure of profound hope for Africa by many in the West and as a savior by some Liberians, partly because she is so stern, her resolve palpable and her standards high, and partly because she is a woman. Her rivals in the next election are likely to include Weah again, as well as an ex-rebel commander named Prince Yormie Johnson, who slaughtered one of the country's recent presidents. Sirleaf would agree with the assessments of why she should keep running Liberia. She takes pride in working long into every night and in standing above -- and, as much as possible, standing up to -- the country's legendary and crippling government corruption. She credits some of her strength to having survived a violently abusive husband. And she doesn't hesitate in declaring that women make better leaders. Women lead more than a quarter of her ministries. If she could find enough qualified females, she told me this summer, and if she could make changes across the board without upsetting political balances, she would appoint women to lead every one of them. ''Women are more committed,'' she said, as we rode past one of the Monrovia neighborhoods that has recently regained public electricity, after Sirleaf's administration started mending the capital's electrical grid that was damaged by the war's ravages. The rest of the city relies on private generators, with most of the cratered streets pitch dark at night. ''Women work harder,'' she continued. ''And women are more honest; they have less reasons to be corrupt. They don't have so many diversions. Men have more than one wife; they have their concubines. We have polygamy here, not polyandry.'' She laughed quietly at her pointed logic. Sirleaf's precise, pointed manner has helped make her a darling in the world of international aid, a reason for believing that the rescue of Africa, with all its misrule, remains possible. Right before she tried to save the keeling fence, she sat in a booth at a Monrovia radio station. She educated listeners about the $4.6 billion worth of debt relief her government had just gained through the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Her administration won the reprieve by designing and starting to implement an auspicious set of fiscal reforms. The relief was, she said to me, perhaps the most important achievement of her presidency so far. And certainly her skilled and perpetual soliciting of international support -- including the forgiven billions; a $20-million-plus loan program for Liberian businesses set up by the African-American entrepreneur and Black Entertainment Television founder Robert Johnson; and $500,000 newly awarded by an American sorority to help Liberia's market women -- has been a centerpiece of her leadership. ''Dey pour penalty on top,'' she explained from the ramshackle radio station, as the broadcast reached much of the country of around three and a half million; its land -- about the size of Ohio -- runs from West African beach to jungle interior. Speaking in Liberia's patois to make sure she was understood, she lectured on the consequence of the debt that had accumulated over decades and dwarfed the nation's current $350 million annual budget: ''We could no borrow a penny!'' She talked about the more modest loans -- with better terms -- she will seek and can well hope to get, now that Liberia has been granted this fresh start and vote of confidence. It was, to an extent, a typical political performance, a president telling her people how wisely she served them. And I couldn't help wondering whether the new loans Sirleaf anticipated, with their generous deferrals of payment, would only result later in another round of impossible amounts owed, another round of forgiveness sought from the world's powerful nations, another confirmation of Liberia's -- and Africa's -- mismanagement and dispiriting dependence on international charity. Yet Sirleaf's no-nonsense tone hushed misgivings. She has a master's degree in public administration from Harvard and a reputation for fiscal vigilance dating back to her rise through Liberia's financial ministry in the late 1960s and '70s. By the '80s, her stances against dictatorial repression and official plundering earned her a sentence to prison and years in exile. ''We see her as one of us,'' Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to Liberia, said, describing Sirleaf's appeal to Western diplomats and dispensers of aid. Thomas-Greenfield, an African-American who originally came to Liberia as a doctoral student studying rice production in the late '70s, and who heard about Sirleaf then, stressed the importance of Sirleaf's having worked, while in exile, as a senior U.N. official and as a Citicorp vice president in Nairobi in charge of the bank's African operation. Sirleaf, she said, straddles worlds with agility. The president is able to address Liberian constituents in ways that disarm distrust of her ''book'' learning; she has managed to work with old political enemies now in the Liberian Legislature; and, the ambassador said: ''She speaks our language. We know, with her, that good governance and corruption are being taken seriously. She's tremendously well liked. We know our dollars are being well spent. And then there's the fact that she's a woman -- the first. We don't want to see her fail.'' Thomas-Greenfield described Sirleaf's lobbying style: ''I wouldn't say that she's charismatic. It's more that she's very serious, very focused. Down to the most minute detail.'' This was easy to imagine, given Sirleaf's attention to the fence amid all else that is awry after a war that unleashed widespread rape and the conscription of child soldiers, perhaps as young as 7, some of them forced to kill their own parents. ''She's bringing this country out of darkness into light,'' Thomas-Greenfield said. Not all Liberians, though, are so enthusiastic. Plenty do recognize Sirleaf's favored status among international benefactors -- and Liberians tend to be keenly aware of the importance of foreign benevolence. But Sirleaf has been in office four years now, and there is a level of impatience with her leadership that I didn't hear on my last trip to Liberia a year ago. She may still be beloved by some as ''Mama Ellen,'' and she may be likely to win another term, yet many Liberians are resentful that they continue to count on packs of vigilantes to protect them, because the police -- whose starting salary is just over $4.50 a day -- are ineffectual and relentlessly corrupt and the courts too slow to matter. Bureaucrats high and low go on requiring bribes and siphoning government funds in ways that have long robbed the country of infrastructure and debilitated the economy. ''We can't stamp it out, not yet,'' Sirleaf said to me, clenching her fists in frustration over the country's bone-deep corruption. She spoke of being torn between firing every transgressing official and keeping enough ministers and staff members at their desks so the government can go on operating, no matter how badly it is compromised. And meanwhile, unemployment in the country, whose population shifted heavily to Monrovia during the war, stands as high as 85 percent by some estimates. Instilling faith that Liberia's economic wasteland can be redeemed, however gradually, may be the only way to ensure long-lasting peace, especially with the U.N. troops expected to start pulling out after next year's elections. Over the radio, Sirleaf put the emphasis on gradually. ''I beg you I no magician,'' she said, letting a plea seep into her lecture. ''I can't just wave a magic wand.'' The president has a light, red-brown complexion; skin that serves as a particular reminder of one cause of her country's implosion. Liberia was founded -- as a coastal settlement in 1822 and as Africa's first republic in 1847 -- by free American blacks, and the settler class that developed did all it could to replicate the American society it had sailed away from. The men wore top hats and tails; the women, bonnets and bustles. The republic designed its flag after the Stars and Stripes of the United States, named its capital after the U.S. president James Monroe and subjugated the tribes within its borders in ways that sometimes resembled outright slavery. Not until 1980 did Liberia have its first indigenous ruler, Samuel Doe, an army sergeant whose coup can be understood as a surge of long-suppressed rage. He disemboweled the president, then executed 13 government ministers before a crowd of hundreds on Monrovia's beach. Today, the divide between the people Liberians refer to as ''native'' and those called ''Americo-Liberian'' still plagues the nation. And Sirleaf, whose complexion is lighter than just about any Liberian's, has pointed out frequently and emphatically that her color is misleading, that she actually has no Americo-Liberian blood whatsoever, that she does not belong to the racial elite whose greed and historic oppression is named by some as the origin of Liberia's brutal collapse. Sirleaf's complexion and her privileged childhood make for a complicated story. She is the granddaughter, on her father's side, of a prominent rural chief and one of his eight wives, and on her mother's of a market woman and a German trader who was soon banished from Liberia, along with all Germans, as Liberia proclaimed its loyalty to the United States at the start of World War I. It's the German lineage that lightens Sirleaf's skin, but the access to education and power that elevated her girlhood stems from a Liberian tradition known as the ward system. Since the early years of the republic, the poor have often sent their sons and daughters to live with the better off, to serve them in return for the promise of schooling and the hope of other opportunities. In this way, indigenous children have cleaned the homes and cooked the meals of the settler class. They have belonged, more or less, to their warder families, as something between slaves and foster children; they have generally been given their warders' last names. Over generations, the tradition hasn't eradicated distinctions of blood and status -- the schooling provided can be meager and the chance for advancement minimal -- but it has blurred the lines. And in Sirleaf's case, it eliminated them. Sent from his remote village to Monrovia as a ward, her father was treated relatively well, in Sirleaf's telling, because his father, as a chief, had become acquainted with the nation's president. Her father apprenticed himself to a lawyer, then practiced as a lawyer and, before a stroke paralyzed him in his 40s, became the first indigenous man elected to Liberia's House of Representatives. Sirleaf's mother, after a cruel stint with her first settler family, was claimed by another warder and raised generously -- in part because of her nearly white skin. Sirleaf's own rise started with sheer girlhood determination. She reminisced with me about her preparations for a fistfight with a neighbor girl over a stolen plum. When she was about 9, Sirleaf asked her grandmother to arrange for her to be given ''a potion, fighting medicine.'' The underside of her left wrist was sliced repeatedly with a razor blade, the potion spread into the wounds. She showed me the still-visible dark scars, as a sign of how badly she wanted to win that battle. Her older sister, Jennie Bernard, recalled Sirleaf's drive and success in school, yet at 17 Sirleaf detoured abruptly from ambition when she fell in love with a man seven years older who had just returned home after going to college in the United States. He married her and took her along when he went to the University of Wisconsin at Madison for a master's degree in agriculture. She enrolled as an undergraduate at a local business college and, when they were strapped for cash, worked in a drugstore. Jealous of her time and ashamed of her menial job, her husband, who has since died, lurched into the store one evening, she recounted, ripped a broom from her hands and screamed that she should be home. He drank and grew more and more aggressive in Madison and when they moved back to Monrovia. At one point, he struck her head with the butt of a gun. Her sister remembered that he once walked into Sirleaf's office, during her early years at the ministry of finance, and slapped her for working late. In reflective tones, Sirleaf spoke with me about his love for her and his possessiveness. She wrested herself from the marriage at last, she said, after he leveled a gun at her in front of one of their four young sons. The boy grabbed a can of mosquito repellent and tried to spray it in his father's eyes to wake him from his blind rage. Sirleaf's marriage seems to have hardened a resilience she always possessed and to have steeled her against the violence that was coming to her country. By the time Samuel Doe carried out his murderous coup in 1980, she had earned her master's at Harvard with the help of an American economics professor advising the government in Monrovia, and she was Liberia's minister of finance. In the overthrow, she had reason to expect to be killed, by Doe himself or by the roving throngs taking revenge on well-off Monrovians. Yet she managed to survive, by her account, through a combination of composure and a knowledge of financial matters that Doe desperately needed. At the dictator's request, she ran one of the nation's largest banks; then, after rebuking the regime for greed and corruption, she fled into exile. When Doe sought the legitimacy of being elected, she risked returning to Liberia and taking an acerbic part in the campaign against him. She was locked up and sentenced to 10 years, then was let go almost immediately, partly because of pressure from the Reagan administration, which supported Doe as a cold-war ally. The experience didn't stop her from defying Doe. Soon she was taken captive again by his men, threatened with rape and told she would be buried alive. Released, she went back into exile. In 1989, while living in the United States, Sirleaf raised money for an insurgency against Doe led by Charles Taylor, who went on to stoke the country's all-consuming war, who claimed Liberia's presidency in a dubious election in 1997, who enriched himself immensely during his rule and who is now on trial, in a special court at the Hague, charged with crimes against humanity committed as he stirred war in neighboring Sierra Leone. Because of her early and enthusiastic backing for Taylor, the Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, charged with helping the nation to heal, recommended last year that she be barred from public office for 30 years. The proposal, which holds no legal power, seems to be viewed by Liberians and Westerners, and by Sirleaf herself, as almost precious. ''We were trying to bring down a dictator,'' Sirleaf said to me, with more impatience than apology. We were creeping along a mud road just outside Monrovia, where the city gives way swiftly to villages and bush. She was going to a ceremony for a new maritime-training center that, she hoped, would help Liberians land jobs as deckhands on foreign ships. As her convoy approached a village, a dusty man beat a conga drum that had a badly torn head, and an impromptu, bedraggled choir sang in tribute. Ordering the convoy to stop, Sirleaf directed one of her staff workers to give the village leader about $20 in cash. It was Sirleaf's money. She did this regularly. She glanced at me, chagrined by the impropriety in the gesture -- but, again, hardly apologetic. There was no government system of support for the poor, she said tersely; this, for now, was the best she could do. One reality she contends with -- the nearness of her nation's explosive history -- may be best captured by the presidential candidacy of Prince Yormie Johnson, the rebel who, in 1990, after a split from Taylor, captured Doe. With a video camera recording the proceedings, Johnson drank beer and looked on while his henchmen sliced off the president's ears. The killing came later. The video is currently sold by peddlers in the capital's downtown. Johnson's run for president might be considered a macabre joke, except that in 2005 the people of his home region elected him to the Liberian Senate. ''It's Obama style!'' he proclaimed to me this summer, talking about the small contributions that were already accumulating in his presidential-campaign chest. With his round cheeks and whitening beard, Johnson looked something like a Liberian Santa Claus. He assured me that his lack of formal education would be an advantage in governing the country: ''Did Abraham Lincoln have a Ph.D.? My support is swelling daily!'' As I watched Sirleaf rigorously and tirelessly at work in her spare, hushed office, I was often struck by the distance she has put between herself and the violence of her own past: the violence inflicted privately upon her as a wife, the violence threatened against her as a public figure. The office sits on the top floor of a government building in which the electricity staggers now and then and the elevator buttons have long been broken. Given her status, Sirleaf works and lives frugally -- a brunch she and I shared at her house one Sunday was made up partly of leftovers set on the table in plastic containers. What she prizes instead of splendor is calm. In the conference rooms adjoining her office, the meetings I watched her run -- with angry widows of Taylor-era soldiers demanding benefits; with a quarreling auditor and minister -- were muted affairs. She listened with stoic patience to everyone, as though only in this way could she keep disgruntlement from leaking out onto the streets like lighter fluid. Sirleaf's mission is, above all, to distance her country as far from violence as she has delivered herself, and her success most likely depends, primarily, on the economy, on her ability to produce signs that decades defined by abject poverty and rampant plundering can be replaced by the hope of simple employment and lawful profit. Without such signs, there is little reason to think that frustration and fatalism won't combust again in the decades to come. So in addition to debt relief, some of Sirleaf's crucial achievements have been the renegotiations of unfavorable contracts with foreign corporations like ArcelorMittal, of Luxembourg, the largest steel company in the world, which plans to mine Liberian iron, and with the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, which has tapped the country's rubber trees for almost a century. Yet to spend time on Firestone's plantation among its thousands of tappers, who scrape at the trunks with barbed knives and scramble to collect their daily quota of latex in zinc buckets, is to confront how inconceivably far the Liberian economy has to go. If the tappers present enough latex at the weighing stations, they can earn $4.41 a day. It is very desirable job by Liberian standards. Liberia's natural resources just aren't in high-enough demand around the world to spur the economy and generate much public revenue. Firestone is providing the government with $4.7 million this year, Sirleaf estimated. To truly take advantage of its iron, rubber and timber, Liberia would have to manufacture things with them; it would have to export finished products rather than raw materials. And it can't; the country is all but preindustrial. The lone hope for Liberia's sudden transformation may lie in offshore petroleum. Oil is not iron or rubber. Sirleaf spoke of recent ocean finds -- not only off the coast of Ghana, but even closer by, in the waters of Sierra Leone and, in the most nascent way, off Liberia's own beaches -- as signs of arriving transfiguration. Imagining the boon to her country if, over the next few years, the intimations become bountiful wells, Sirleaf lost hold of the harsh realism that usually keeps her thoughts and words blade-sharp. I asked whether she worried that corruption would devour the benefits that oil could bring to Liberia, as had happened in Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea. Not, she replied, if a major company like Chevron winds up winning the rights to drill -- as it did, soon after my visit. She couldn't possibly have been unaware of Chevron's dark history along Nigeria's southern shoreline, but at that moment, while she envisioned the company pumping oil from her coast, such history seemed far from her mind. While we talked, British Petroleum's Deep Horizon well was spewing into the Gulf of Mexico, and I mentioned to Sirleaf that if such a disaster befell Liberia, her country would command a lot less attention than the United States when it came time to clean up. ''Let's find it first before we worry about the spilling,'' she said, realism and severity returning. ''Right now we're worried about feeding the people and giving them jobs. The environment -- we'll take care of it later.'' If by way of oil, or if by slower yet still miraculous economic metamorphoses, or if because Liberians are just too weary of war, stability takes root in her country, then one of Sirleaf's deepest ambitions might be realized: to improve the plight of women, who suffered inordinately throughout the years of fighting. Rape was endemic during the war, and, Sirleaf lamented, it infects the culture now. A new courtroom has been built; it is reserved for trying cases of sexual assault, an attempt to assure women that such crimes will be taken seriously and to dissuade them from settling with rapists informally -- sometimes, as happened in a case I followed during a visit several years ago, for as little as $2. But to step into the Women and Children Protection Unit in the Liberian police department's headquarters in Monrovia is to sense that even a determined female president may have trouble providing women with much in the way of safety. The dilapidated headquarters is a kind of vertical cave, blearily lighted where it is lighted at all. The place all but advertises the country's flimsy ability to enforce its laws, yet given her meager budget, Sirleaf said that before she considers renovating the building, she intends to construct living quarters for the police in rural areas, where it is hard to attract recruits and where enforcement is even flimsier than in the capital. The Women and Children Protection Unit, where rape victims are meant to report their assaults, sits at the end of a hall of cryptlike offices filled with men, some in uniform, some perhaps detectives in plainclothes, some criminals, some just loitering, spilling into the corridor. At the end of this menacing gantlet, in the Protection Unit, a female receptionist and a female sergeant wait at scarred wooden desks. But even here the men leach in; the headquarters is their domain, and it is easy to imagine that women would rather be paid minimally for their suffering than begin the search for justice in this place. A brighter expression of Sirleaf's goals lies along one of the capital's rutted dirt lanes. A Nike Foundation program trains Liberian women in their late teens and early 20s to work in offices or hotels. Sirleaf's lobbying persuaded the sporting-goods giant to choose Liberia as the pilot nation for the project, which will try to imbue 2,500 women around the country with vocational skills. Proudly, one of the young women led me on a tour through the training stations for the course on hotel hospitality. Wearing vibrant African fabrics, she led me past a hand-scrawled sign -- ''Mama Ellen Johnson Sirleaf we love you for what you are doing for the young girls of our nation'' -- and into the facsimile of a guest room where the students practiced making beds; into the bathroom where two girls in masks were practicing the scrubbing of toilets; out to a gazebo arranged as a mock restaurant, with a table fully set and a chalkboard announcing ''Chicken Liberian Style'' as the day's special. ''If I can provide my own money, men will not be able to carry on their violence,'' one student said hopefully, referring not to rape but to the range of commonplace assaults she and her fellow trainees might typically endure. And the stations were so orderly that it was easy to believe, at least briefly, that all the graduates would soon be employed -- menially, in many cases, but gainfully. All sorts of transformations appeared plausible in the mock restaurant with the paper napkins slipped daintily inside the glasses. And then reality reasserted itself. Where were the Liberian hotels to hire these students? The country has a handful of places that cater to visiting U.N. employees and the few foreign investors looking for resources to be reaped. But Liberian tourism is hardly a growth industry. ''I'm going to show you a beautiful spot,'' Sirleaf said to me one afternoon, as if to answer my doubts about the trainees' prospects, though I hadn't raised the dispiriting subject. Near the village whose drummer had beat at his torn conga drum, her convoy stopped at a wispy and graceful bridge stretching over a small river. A lush green island lay on the far side of the span, and a pair of ample, alluring houses stood perched over the water, one on either bank. The property belonged to a man she knew, she said. She saw it as the beginning of a future resort. The president of Liberia stood amid the luxuriant calm of that lovely dream."4-Nov-10,COTE D'IVOIRE (98%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (79%),"ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast -- Uneasy calm settled over this usually busy West African hub on Wednesday as a runoff vote loomed between President Laurent Gbagbo and a longtime rival whom the incumbent's supporters accuse of not being Ivorian enough. Three days after a huge turnout for a long-delayed presidential election intended to help stitch this nation back together, Mr. Gbagbo had a strong lead but fell short of the majority needed to win outright in the first round. Final results announced late Wednesday by the electoral commission showed Mr. Gbagbo, a populist strongman who has clung to power for five years since his legal term expired, with 38 percent of the vote, The Associated Press reported. His rival, Alassane Ouattara, a former prime minister and International Monetary Fund official, had 32 percent. The two men have dominated the tangled politics of this once booming agricultural powerhouse for nearly two decades, sparring with each other in person and by proxy in sometimes violent confrontations between their supporters on the street. Another leading candidate, former President Henri Konan Bedie, was third with about 25 percent. His party called for a recount, accusing the electoral commission of publishing false results in a ''clear desire'' to rig the vote, The A.P. reported. On Wednesday, Abidjan's downtown district, Plateau, a forlorn mini-Manhattan of dilapidated high-rises dimly recalling the country's former prosperity, was far quieter than usual, with stores and restaurants shuttered against possible violence. Traffic was light on roads normally jammed with cars, and many civil servants have simply stayed home all week, according to Ivorian newspapers. ''People want to be home because they don't want to be in the wrong place at the wrong time,'' said Dr. Abdul-Karim Cissoko, standing in front of his pharmacy on a downtown street. ''People don't want to take risks,'' he said. ''They are still haunted by the pillaging'' that took place in mass demonstrations in Abidjan earlier in the decade, when the country split apart in a civil war. It remains cut in half, with the north in the hands of a rebel group, the Forces Nouvelles. ''People are afraid it will degenerate,'' said Ayowa Koffi, an electrician, walking up a deserted street. ''They remember what happened, before. So as a precaution they are staying home.'' Sunday's vote was the first truly free and independent one in the country's 50-year history. Previous ones were tainted by manipulation from above. About 80 percent of the country's 5.7 million registered voters cast ballots in the election on Sunday. Observers from the European Union this week noted hiccups in what was essentially a new experience for the country. Those problems, combined with the long and intense rivalry between Mr. Gbagbo and Mr. Ouattara, have contributed to the tense post-vote climate here. Mr. Gbagbo, a historian and former university professor, was jailed in the early 1990s while Mr. Ouattara was prime minister under the authoritarian ruler who dominated the country's political life for three decades after independence, Felix Houphouet-Boigny. Mr. Gbagbo's supporters mocked Mr. Ouattara's name at rallies last week and railed about his supposedly foreign origins -- old xenophobic themes in politics here that the president himself has touched on in the past. Mr. Ouattara was showing particular strength in the Muslim north from which he comes, a foreshadowing of possible renewed ethnic tensions to come. Problems were apparent in this new exercise, but observers said there were no catastrophic difficulties. The head of the European Union observer mission here, Cristian Preda, a Romanian member of the European Parliament, said that the heads of the 20,000 polling places often ''didn't know exactly what to do with the results'' when the voting was over, even asking on occasion, ''Is there a scooter available?'' to carry them to central tabulation spots. Additionally, the observers were refused entry at 14 polling places, and the results were not posted on the outside of the voting areas. ''The arrangements appeared to have been made between the political actors,'' to the exclusion of the people, Mr. Preda said. ''The Ivorians deserve more respect.''"29-Nov-10,COTE D'IVOIRE (97%),"ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (Reuters) -- Ivory Coast's presidential hopefuls traded accusations of voter intimidation on Sunday in a runoff election meant to end a decade of political instability. The incumbent, President Laurent Gbagbo, faced Alassane Ouattara, a former prime minister and senior official with the International Monetary Fund, in a tight race that has rekindled simmering tensions in the country. The electoral commission has said results will start to trickle out on Sunday night, although it could take days before a clear trend emerges. Five members of the security forces were killed in the west of the country, according to the president's office. The opposition and ruling parties exchanged accusations of intimidation as gangs of youths loyal to the parties gathered outside polling stations along the boulevards of this lagoon-side city. ''Since the start of the vote, we have seen systematic blocking,'' Mr. Ouattara's campaign manager, Marcel Tanon, told journalists, adding that party representatives were prevented from going to some polling stations and chased away from others. He said roadblocks were set up by pro-Gbagbo youths who checked voting cards and blocked likely opposition voters, and he suggested that might affect ''the credibility of the vote.'' The president's campaign manager, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, meanwhile said that in rebel zones sympathetic to Mr. Ouattara, ''our delegations were blocked.'' An overnight curfew was called by Mr. Gbagbo to stem violence after at least seven people were killed in clashes between rival factions and security forces in the week before the vote. The move illustrated heightened tension after a peaceful first round of voting, and was criticized by Mr. Gbagbo's rivals, who feared it would be used to rig the result. ''We're afraid things will get hot,'' said Anderson N'Guessan, a lawyer, as he waited to vote in Abidjan's steamy humidity. Mr. Gbagbo and Mr. Ouattara won 38 and 32 percent in the first round respectively. The race has brought back to the fore a north-south divide that was at the heart of a 2002-3 war and subsequent delays in holding an election. Mr. Ouattara said Sunday that the five-day curfew had been lifted, but Mr. Gbagbo said later that it was still in place. ''There is only one person who can announce a curfew or lift it and that's the president,'' Mr. Gbagbo said after voting."5-Dec-10,COTE D'IVOIRE (99%); WESTERN AFRICA (93%); FRANCE (93%); UNITED STATES (92%); AFRICA (79%),"ABIDJAN, IVORY COAST - The two candidates in Ivory Coast's disputed presidential election took dueling oaths of office Saturday after each claimed victory, sending a simmering political crisis out of control and renewing unrest in this country once split by civil war. Incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo defied calls from the United States, France and the United Nations to concede defeat, wrapping himself in the Ivorian flag as he was sworn in for another term. Hours later, opposition candidate Alassane Ouattara announced he too had taken an oath of office. The developments leave Ivory Coast with two men claiming to be president, further inflaming the political chaos in the West African nation whose once-prosperous economy was destroyed by the brief 2002-03 civil war. President Obama and French President Nicolas Sarkozy say Ouattara is the rightful winner and that his victory must be acknowledged. The top U.N. official in Ivory Coast is also standing by results released Thursday by the country's election commission that put Ouattara ahead. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon expressed ""deep concern over the continuing standoff,"" his spokesman said Saturday. Prime Minister Guillaume Soro, a former rebel leader who had served in a unity government with Gbagbo since a 2007 peace deal, said Saturday he was backing Ouattara, who is popular in the formerly rebel-held north. Ouattara said his first act as president was to reappoint Soro. ""These last days have been difficult, but I can tell you now that Ivory Coast is in good hands,"" Ouattara said just hours after Gbagbo held his inauguration ceremony at the presidential palace. At his swearing-in, Gbagbo renewed allegations that his supporters had been intimidated in the north, repeating the rationale used by the country's constitutional council to throw out half a million ballots that were cast in Ouattara strongholds. ""You think that you can cheat, stuff ballot boxes and intimidate voters, and that the other side won't see what is going on,"" Gbagbo said. On Saturday, Ouattara backers  took to the streets, burning tires and a table in one neighborhood. ""The risk of violence between supporters of the two parties, as well as repression by Ivorian security forces against real or perceived supporters of Ouattara, is very high,"" Corinne Dufka, senior West Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. Gbagbo's five-year mandate expired in 2005 and the country's first election in a decade was delayed multiple times. He claimed first that the West African country was too volatile and that security could not be assured. He later cited technicalities such as the composition of voter rolls. The election proceeded in October but then headed to a runoff vote last Sunday. The country's election commission announced Thursday that Ouattara had won. However, new results released Friday on national television by a Gbagbo loyalist who heads the constitutional council said that the incumbent president had in fact been reelected. Gbagbo says he is the rightful winner of the runoff vote, citing the Ivorian constitution that gives ultimate authority on the issue to the country's constitutional council, which called him the winner. However, Ouattara points to the 2007 peace deal, which states that the United Nations must certify the election results. The world body maintains that the vote was credible and that Ouattara won. A former economist for the International Monetary Fund, Ouattara became the icon of Ivory Coast's downtrodden immigrant community in a nation that became a magnet in the region because of its prosperity. Ouattara, born in the north, had been prevented from running in previous elections after allegations that he was not Ivorian. - Associated Press"19-Feb-11,ALGERIA (95%); NORTHERN AFRICA (92%); TUNISIA (79%); EGYPT (79%); AFRICA (79%),"ALGIERS -- Even as North African neighbors have smoldered, the oil-producing giant Algeria has kept a sullen calm in the wake of a stifled protest march here last week, with the regional upheaval, for now, not catching on. Police officers deployed widely in the whitewashed streets to tamp down an antigovernment rally on Feb. 12, and they are expected to do so again on Saturday, though pro-democracy activists and a handful of opposition parties vow to go ahead with the march anyway. The government has promised concessions in the wake of the turbulence that has swept the region, accelerating vows to lift a years-old state of emergency and speaking of new jobs and housing. A top official appeared Thursday night on state television to talk of ''errors that must be corrected.'' Discontent with the government is real. Five died in riots in January, and hundreds of small protests throughout the country punctuated all of 2010, analysts say. The repression, youth unemployment and large-scale corruption that provoked uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt exist here, too, they said. Conditions are ripe for revolt. But the upheavals in those neighboring countries are unlikely to be immediately repeated in this vast desert nation of 34 million, four times the size of France, say analysts and some political figures here. The scars of a decade of recent civil war are still too fresh -- more than 100,000 people were killed during the 1990s in a bloody uprising of Islamists that was brutally repressed by the army. The government is awash in oil money -- Algeria has Africa's third-largest proven reserves -- and is adept at distributing it to dull discontent: wages for civil servants have risen 34 percent recently, according to the International Monetary Fund. The ailing president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, 73, is a holdover from the earliest days of independence but is considered a mere figurehead for aging military officers who hold real power, but whose precise identities are considered opaque. ''The real deciders, who are they?'' asked one of the demonstration leaders, Mostefa Bouchachi, the head of the Algerian League for Human Rights. Opposition parties with long memories of compromises made during the decade of Islamist insurgency distrust one another and appear uninterested, for the moment, in coalescing around a common set of grievances. For now, little sense of revolutionary fervor bubbles up from the smart shops and winding hilly streets of a seaside capital that claims insurrection along with Parisian-style edifices as its heritage. The generation that waged guerrilla war against the French a half-century ago still wields power, now rich from oil but nationalist talk intact -- providing both an irritant and a hold on the population, over half of which is under 30. Yet credible estimates of the Feb. 12 demonstration at an austere intersection called May 1 Square put the turnout at no more than a few thousand, vastly outnumbered by the police. ''There is enough anger, but is anger enough? I don't think so,'' said Karim Tabbou, national secretary of the largest Algerian opposition party, the Socialist Forces Front. His party is snubbing the demonstrations, which are banned under the emergency laws but which smaller opposition groups vow will be repeated every Saturday until the government changes. ''Most Algerians don't want to risk an adventure,'' Mr. Tabbou said. ''Physical confrontation, Algerians want no part of that.'' ''Symbolically, people are still traumatized by what happened before,'' he said. ''The authorities play on this fear,'' he added. Indeed, police checkpoints and roadblocks, ostensibly to counter the Islamists, still exist in many parts of the capital. For now, the street protests here appear to be the expression of a minority, even among those who oppose the government. In particular, the political party leading the movement, the Rally for Culture and Democracy, is distrusted for having backed the army's brutal campaign against the Islamists in the 1990s. The country's ''democratic forces must do an immense amount of work to reconstruct their credibility,'' said Luis Martinez, an Algeria specialist at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques in Paris, noting that they were ''associated with the repression of the Islamists'' and were considered to have ''played the regime's game.'' The government of Mr. Bouteflika -- he was re-elected to a third term with a widely derided 90 percent of votes in 2009 -- is not popular, Mr. Martinez and other analysts said, but neither is the opposition. The protests are being pushed by ''elite intellectuals,'' said Nacer Meghenine, who runs a youth cultural organization in the working-class neighborhood of Bab el Oued. He opposed the Feb. 12 rally, even though he said he believed that ''the people are demanding radical change.'' It is not going to come through Algeria's political parties, however, in Mr. Meghenine's view. ''The day the people go out on the streets, they're not going to ask for permission,'' Mr. Meghenine said. His neighborhood was packed with street vendors and men and women, some veiled, doing their daily shopping. The riots that broke out here in January were provoked partly by police harassment of the men making their living selling in the street -- what one shoe seller, Amar Laksas, called, ''injustice, contempt, no work.'' Though he took part in those earlier protests, he did not demonstrate on May 1 Square. Down the street, about 40 families are crammed into the shell of what was a pharmaceutical factory; raw sewage flows through a makeshift pipe system into the building's basement. A third of Algerians live on less than $2 a day, Mr. Martinez said. ''There is a feeling of injustice in this country,'' Mr. Bouchachi said."22-May-11,COTE D'IVOIRE (97%); AFRICA (93%); SENEGAL (92%); FRANCE (92%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%); UNITED STATES (79%); EUROPE (79%); LIBERIA (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (79%),"DAKAR, Senegal -- Alassane Ouattara was formally inaugurated Saturday as Ivory Coast's president in a ceremony in the West African nation's capital, Yamoussoukro, nearly six weeks after his predecessor was forcibly removed from office with the help of French and United Nations military strikes. Mr. Ouattara called for reconciliation and peace in a country that was once one of Africa's richest but that has been devastated by years of unrest, political division and civil war. ''The time has arrived for Ivorians to come together,'' Mr. Ouattara, a former economist and banker, said in a speech that did not deviate from his habitually austere manner. ''Dear brothers and sisters, let's celebrate peace. Like the great people we are, we are going to reunite. Yes, we are going to come together. Let us learn to live together again.'' The country is still reeling from a four-month armed standoff that killed as many as 3,000 people, according to officials and human rights groups, and that sent tens of thousands of refugees fleeing violence into neighboring lands. About 160,000 are still in exile in Liberia, according to the International Rescue Committee. Sanctions imposed by the European Union, the United States and regional governments had crippled the economy as President Laurent Gbagbo, who decisively lost the presidential election in November, refused to give up office. Life is slowly returning to a semblance of normalcy. Banks have reopened, the nation's vital cocoa exports have resumed and civil servants have returned to their desks with two months' back pay. Mr. Ouattara must govern under the burden of multiple handicaps. The country is still split between his supporters and those of Mr. Gbagbo, who received 46 percent of the vote in the election; whole villages and cocoa farms in the west remain devastated; and Mr. Ouattara was installed largely by foreign forces. Months of African diplomacy proved ineffectual in dislodging Mr. Gbagbo, and Mr. Ouattara's fighters played a secondary role. Ultimately, it was the French missile attacks against Mr. Gbagbo's heavy-weapons installations that led to his defeat. France's central role was recognized at the ceremony in Yamoussoukro when its president, Nicolas Sarkozy, in the audience, was the first head of state to be saluted by Mr. Ouattara, and received sustained applause. Yet much of the population, especially Mr. Gbagbo's supporters, resent the former colonial master and consider Mr. Ouattara as France's man. About 20 heads of state attended the ceremony, including African leaders who have clung to office for decades and are themselves beneficiaries of disputed or fraudulent elections. The event took place in Yamoussoukro, the native village of Ivory Coast's founding president, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, and its official capital, although Abidjan is the main commercial city and center of government. Mr. Gbagbo remains under house arrest in the northern town of Korhogo, where he has been interrogated by Ouattara officials with a view to possible prosecution, and about 200 members of his government are also to be questioned, according to officials. Mr. Gbagbo's wife, Simone, a powerful influence in his government, has been interrogated in a separate location. Mr. Ouattara has promised a South African-style ''dialogue, truth and reconciliation'' commission to look into the conflict, and he has asked the International Criminal Court to investigate crimes committed ''since Nov. 28,'' the date of the election whose result Mr. Gbagbo refused to acknowledge. Mr. Ouattara's call for the investigation to include ''all of Ivorian territory'' reiterates his position that any atrocities committed by forces that eventually declared their loyalty to him, including a massacre in which hundreds died in Duekoue in the west, should also be punished. Nonetheless, according to Human Rights Watch, ''the majority of abuses during the first three months were by forces under Gbagbo's control'' and ''probably amounted to crimes against humanity.'' Indeed, the civilian population in Abidjan was repeatedly attacked, over the course of months, by uniformed men directly under Mr. Gbagbo's control, in what appeared to be deliberate state policy. The killings of Gbagbo supporters that took place at the end of the conflict were carried out by ragtag forces that only belatedly swung to Mr. Ouattara. Mr. Ouattara, a former prime minister and deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, faces the immense task of rebuilding a country damaged by civil war, 10 years of what is widely acknowledged as the corrupt leadership of Mr. Gbagbo and fierce ethnic divisions. The new government filed suit in Swiss courts this month against Mr. Gbagbo and his entourage to recover tens of millions of dollars in assets. It was less than three weeks ago that the last pro-Gbagbo mercenaries were finally rooted out of Abidjan, fleeing across the lagoons to the west and killing dozens as they went. United Nations investigators later discovered a mass grave containing some 68 bodies in the neighborhood where the Gbagbo forces had been entrenched."17-Jan-12,NIGERIA (96%); LATIN AMERICA (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); ASIA (79%); MIDDLE EAST (79%); AFRICA (79%),"LAGOS, Nigeria -- Nigeria swallowed a hard lesson on Monday that has been inflicted on governments of developing nations the world over for years: try cutting subsidies for gas and the populace will erupt in rage. Faced down by thousands of demonstrators, demands for his removal and a weeklong general strike that paralyzed his fractious country, President Goodluck Jonathan abruptly gave in, partly restoring the fuel subsidy that -- more than an Islamic insurgency in the north or a long-running conflict in the south -- seemed to crystallize the frustrations of the people and draw them to the streets in outrage. ''Government appreciates that the implementation of the deregulation policy would cause initial hardships,'' Mr. Jonathan said in a stiffly worded capitulation on Monday, after a week of refusing to back down. Similar scenes have played out around the world in recent years, from Latin America to the Middle East to Asia, and the government response is frequently the same: give in quickly, despite the counsel of economists and international financial institutions that fuel subsidies are wasteful and distorting, sapping governments of money that could otherwise be used to improve education, public health or other needs. The Nigerian government spends about $8 billion a year on fuel subsidies, and getting rid of them would be ''an important first step'' to shoring up the finances of one of Africa's largest economies, according to a 2009 International Monetary Fund report. But in resource-rich countries like Nigeria, with its enormous gap between rich and poor, subsidized gas is one of the few benefits trickling down from an infamously corrupt government that has pocketed billions of dollars in oil profits, with little to show for it. For the poor -- and three-fourths of this country's population lives on about a dollar a day -- the fuel subsidy means a cheap ride to the market. It means lower prices for the food they buy there. And it means some sense of ownership in a national resource, oil, in which roughly 80 percent of the economic benefit has flowed to 1 percent of the population, according to some estimates. ''It's one of the few ways the urban and rural poor feel they benefit from this strategic resource,'' said Michael J. Watts, an expert on the politics of oil at the University of California, Berkeley. ''The fuel subsidy is experienced as one of the few things they get.'' That sentiment was strongly in evidence as the protests dwindled here on Monday. Under the rollback union leaders agreed to, gas in Nigeria will drop to about $2.27 a gallon from about $3.50 -- higher than the $1.70 price before Jan. 1, but low enough to end the strike. Still, many Nigerians were disappointed that Mr. Jonathan had not dropped the price all the way back down. ''We are not benefitting from this oil!'' shouted Ali Mohammed, a motorcycle-taxi driver. ''No lights, no roads, no hospitals. Make him reduce the price. We are suffering in this country.'' Hundreds of other young men milled about close by in what has been a center of the protest here: the New Afrika Shrine nightclub of the Afro-beat star Femi Kuti, son of the Nigerian musician and dissident Fela Kuti. In a speech Monday morning, Mr. Kuti both incited and calmed the crowd listening at his feet amid clouds of marijuana smoke, expressing disgust with Nigeria's institutions from his rickety wooden stage as supporters murmured their approval. Later in his office, Mr. Kuti shouted at his television as he watched the labor leaders announce the end of the strike. ''I told you those people would back down,'' he said to his aides, looking up from the screen. As for the government, he said, ''They prosecute people for being gay, but there is no law against stealing 14 million.'' Nigeria has seen similar tumult over the issue in the past, and it is hardly alone. In Bolivia, protesters burned photos of President Evo Morales and vandalized government buildings in December 2010, forcing Mr. Morales to withdraw his subsidy-cutting measure only days after introducing it. In Venezuela, before the rise of Hugo Chavez, days of riots and hundreds of deaths followed a fuel price rise in 1989. President Chavez now controls one of the world's most generous fuel subsidies, despite being critical of it. In Jordan, an announcement last year that subsidies would be lifted helped inspire antigovernment demonstrations that forced a reversal. In Indonesia, a 30 percent increase in fuel prices in 2008 led to bloody rioting. Economists nonetheless praise that country for doing what others often do not: sweetening subsidy removal with cash programs that aid the poor. Iran has employed a similar strategy, eliminating subsidized prices for fuel but cushioning the blow with cash payments of roughly $45 a month. The approach ''was critical in preventing the kind of thing that we're seeing happening in Nigeria,'' said Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, an economics professor at Virginia Tech, adding that other Middle East countries shouldering subsidies they can ill afford, most notably Egypt, are looking at Iran's plan as a possible model. The International Monetary Fund and other global financial institutions do not like fuel subsidies, pointing out that the biggest benefits do not even go to the poor, but rather to the owners of large cars and big generators. Yet it was not the wealthy in Nigeria, or even the small middle class, that forced Mr. Jonathan to back down most of the way. ''Even though most fuel subsidies go to the nonpoor, the fraction of their income that goes to fuel is much greater,'' said Shanta Devarajan, the World Bank's chief economist for Africa. ''That's why they feel the elimination of subsidies much more.'' On Monday in Lagos, the government appeared to be anticipating trouble, with army checkpoints on major roads, which were uncharacteristically deserted because of the strike. In the end the day was calm, though a feeling of anger at the unions for calling off the strike, and at the government for not restoring the full subsidy, permeated Mr. Kuti's hangarlike nightclub. The protest movement here, though brief, came to encompass frustrations broader than the sudden rise in fuel prices, and some of the young men milling about on Monday wore ''Occupy Nigeria'' T-shirts. The protesters made it clear that the fuel subsidy removal -- abrupt and unaccompanied by any palliative measures -- was seen as one more act of insensitivity by a government they criticized for favoring the wealthy. ''We are the people, but they are not listening to us,'' said Tayo Sola, an unemployed university graduate. ''So what is the meaning of democracy? You are not ready to listen. So how can you govern?''"7-Apr-12,SIERRA LEONE (96%); RUSSIAN FEDERATION (95%); ALBANIA (94%); NIGERIA (94%); SWITZERLAND (92%); AFRICA (92%); NETHERLANDS (79%); EUROPE (79%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%);,"Bingu wa Mutharika, an obscure economic minister who became the president of Malawi in 2004 and later brought his country to the brink of failure, died April 5 at a hospital in Blantyre, the country's commercial capital. He was 78. Physicians who treated the president confirmed to the Associated Press that he died after a heart attack. The Malawian government has issued no official statement about Mr. Mutharika's death. Reports from Malawian news media suggested that a succession struggle was imminent. A small, landlocked nation of 16 million people in southeastern Africa, Malawi has long been considered one of the world's poorest countries. During the mid-2000s, starving Malawians were known to eat grasshoppers in order to live. For a few years, Mr. Mutharika changed all of that. ""He presided over some of the most successful economic growth probably since the early 1990s,"" said Peter VonDoepp, a professor of African politics at the University of Vermont. ""The second thing he was known for was the shrinking of the democratic space and the decline of governance in the country."" A one-time World Bank economist and United Nations trade expert, Mr. Mutharika had spent much of his life beyond Malawi's borders, living in self-imposed exile during the brutal three-decade rule of Hastings Kamuzu Banda, beginning in the early 1960s. Mr. Mutharika returned to Malawi after the country's first democratic elections in 1994 and was made an economic minister in 2002 by President Bakili Muluzi. VonDoepp said that Mr. Mutharika ""came to power somewhat by accident."" After a failed effort to amend the constitution to seek a third term in office, Muluzi annointed Mr. Mutharika to succeed him. Mr. Mutharika won the multi-party election in 2004 with 35 percent of the vote. ""Because he wanted to remain top dog in the ruling party,"" VonDoepp said, ""Muluzi appointed one of his most obscure and most politically unskilled cabinet minister to serve as the party candidate for the United Democratic Front, with the idea that Mutharika would be a puppet."" But Muluzi's plans failed. Mr. Mutharika began a campaign to rid the government of corrupt officials and prosecuted members of the old regime. He courted Western officials and received hundreds of millions of dollars in aid from the United States and Britain. The president helped subsidize fertilizer supplies for Malawi's poor farmers, leading to a six-year span when the economy grew rapidly. Stocks of burley tobacco, Malawi's leading export, soared. A food shortage that had threatened millions of Malawians was reversed with a surplus of maize. Mr. Mutharika won reelection in 2009 with 66 percent of the vote. His grip on power began to weaken, however, during his second term. He became increasingly intolerant of outside critics, VonDoepp said, and passed laws that limited freedom of the press. Critics were thrown in jail. Malawi's stores of foreign currency started to disappear, which curtailed the government's ability to pay for fuel and led to shortages. The most vibrant industry was sent into turmoil when global prices of tobacco dropped. Mr. Mutharika exacerbated the mess when he refused to devalue the local currency, the kwacha, ignoring the advice of International Monetary Fund experts. The crisis reached its apogee in July 2011, when 19 demonstrators marching for reforms were killed by Malawian troops and 275 citizens were arrested. Mr. Mutharika, whose nickname was Chitsulo cha Njanji, which means ""railroad track of steel,"" vowed that he would crush the rebellion. ""I'll go after you!"" Mr. Mutharika said on state-run television. ""Even if you hide in holes, I'll smoke you out!"" Amid the turbulence, Britain froze its aid and the United States suspended a critical $350 million grant. At his death, Mr. Mutharika may be said to have improved the plight of average Malawians, but only minimally. Today, the average life expectancy is 52 years, and 11 percent of the country is infected with HIV/AIDS. Brightson Webster Ryson Thom was born Feb. 24, 1924, in the Thyolo district of what was then the British protectorate of Nyasaland. He changed his name to Bingu wa Mutharika in the 1960s after Malawi attained independence from Britain. Mr. Mutharika studied at the University of Delhi in India, where he received bachelor's and master's degrees in economics. He claimed to have received a doctorate in economics from Pacific Western University in Los Angeles. In 2004, a Government Accountability Office report concluded that Pacific Western was a ""diploma mill"" that charged a ""flat fee for a degree."" Mr. Mutharika worked for the United Nations from 1978 to 1990 before becoming secretary general of Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, a trade group. He was dismissed in 1997, however, after the group found that Mr. Mutharika lacked ""the vision to take COMESA into the next century."" Back in Malawi, he became a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank before his appointment to Muluzi's cabinet. His first wife, Ethel Mutharika, died in 2007. Survivors include his second wife, Callista Chimombo, a former tourism minister, and four children from his first marriage. As president, Mr. Mutharika lived in a 300-room palace built by the dictator Banda. In 2010, he became chairman of the African Union, succeeding Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi, who called Mr. Mutharika ""my brother."" shapirot@washpost.com A do-over with Egypt  It's not often that the United States has the obligation, or the opportunity, to completely remake its relationship with one of the world's major nations. Usually, for better or for worse, ties are locked in by history, perpetuated by enduring elites, and defended by powerful lobbies. Even bad policies are hard to change. Now, however, Washington has no choice but to rebuild its connection with Egypt - the most populous and historically most important Arab nation, the owner of the Suez Canal and a prime U.S. ally for more than 40 years. It is a daunting, even scary prospect for the State Department and Obama White House. But it is also offers a chance to correct some of the mistakes America has made for decades in its dealings with Arab leaders. The remake launches this week when Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton visits Cairo. The need for a revamp has been obvious for some time, but it became imperative last month when Mohammed Morsi, the candidate of the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, won Egypt's first free election for president. Up until then, and despite Egypt's popular revolution last year, U.S. policy had centered on the powerful military and the succession of pharaoh-like leaders it  backed. Year after year, strategic allegiance and peace with Israel was purchased with $1.5 billion in annual military and economic aid. Now it gets complicated. For the foreseeable future, U.S. officials will have to navigate between Morsi and the Brotherhood, with their nominally democratic but fundamentally anti-Western agenda; the military, which is doing its best to block the creation of democratic institutions while preserving its lifelines with the Pentagon and Israel; and the secular democratic forces that led last year's revolution, which are broadly pro-Western but are squeezed by both the generals and the clerics. A successful walk along this tightrope could preserve Egypt as a core U.S. ally and peaceful neighbor of Israel while transforming it into a functional democracy - something that would make both those roles more stable. Or, Egypt could become the world's next Pakistan, a country riven between incompetent and corrupt civilian politicians and double-dealing military commanders. The Obama administration's first two steps in this acrobacy managed to alienate and confuse all sides. First, in March, it waived congressional conditions on this year's military aid that required the generals to complete a democratic transition - something that may have encouraged the military's subsequent dismissal of the elected Congress and usurpation of the new president's powers. Egyptian democrats felt betrayed. But then last month the administration leaned heavily on the ruling military council to recognize Morsi's victory in a runoff election. Lobbying by Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta may have prevented the council from handing the presidency to its favored candidate, a former prime minister. But it infuriated the generals, Egyptian Christians and some U.S. supporters of Israel, who fear the Islamists more than the old regime. Now what? Quite understandably there's been vigorous debate inside the administration about the best way to approach Morsi, and about how to use U.S. aid. What seems to be emerging is a cautious, step-by-step approach in which Morsi's government would get U.S. support in obtaining economic assistance from the International Monetary Fund as well as a long-delayed debt-swap deal - provided that it follows through on promises to preserve the rights of women and religious minorities, respects democratic norms and preserves peace with Israel. In a visit to Cairo Sunday, Deputy Secretary of State William Burns sketched those terms following a meeting with Morsi during which he delivered a letter from Obama. Burns didn't publicly mention military aid, but the administration has been thinking about that, too. The consensus is it should be continued for now, but some officials believe it should eventually be restructured, reduced and focused on missions like counter-terrorism and border protection, rather than the purchase of expensive American hardware. In conception, that's not a bad plan. The challenge will be avoiding the classic pitfalls of U.S. Middle East diplomacy. One is to shower too much attention and favor on those who happen to be in power. Though the military and the Muslim Brotherhood hold the strongest cards for now, neither can be a strong or reliable partner over time. America's real friends are Egypt's secular democrats and its emerging middle class, who have been shoved to the sidelines but are the country's best long-term hope. The other big danger is that U.S. policy will be pushed back into the old ruts by Egyptian or domestic pressure. The military will resist any alteration of the aid program, or supplanting of its influence in Washington by civilian leaders. Some in Congress will demand that the administration deny aid to an Islamist government. Giving into those pressures would be the quickest way to blow this opportunity for diplomatic change - and turn Egypt into a second Pakistan. diehlj@washpost.com Textile strike tests Egypt's new leader  MAHALLA EL-KUBRA, Egypt - Four years ago, protests in this Egyptian cotton mill city sowed the seeds of the revolution that ultimately toppled President Hosni Mubarak. Today Mahalla is again seething, as a strike by tens of thousands of textile workers entered its second week Sunday, posing an early test for Egypt's new president, Mohamed Morsi. The spreading labor unrest threatens one of Egypt's key export industries at a time when the country teeters on the brink of a balance of payments crisis. It also signifies how expectations that were raised by last year's revolution have remained largely unfulfilled, and how that frustration could boil over into more unrest, with further disastrous consequences for the economy. ""Mahalla created the spirit of the revolution,"" said Hamdi Nasheby, 60, a white-bearded man dressed in a flowing grey gown, or jalabiya, who said he had worked at the factory in the fertile heart of the Nile Delta for 45 years. ""But now that the revolution has happened and Egyptians have gained their rights, they have forgotten the suffering of Mahalla - the revolution has forgotten us."" Around him, dozens of his fellow workers gestured angrily on a recent afternoon, shouting over each other as they tried to explain their demands: a share in the profits of the sprawling state-owned Misr Spinning and Weaving Co., better health-care and retirement packages, a raise in monthly wages from 700 to 1,000 Egyptian pounds ($115 to $165), and the dismissal of the company's chief executive. Behind them, the factory gates were padlocked, the wide concrete smokestacks idle and the sandstone administration buildings vacant as hundreds of their colleagues sat under tarpaulins to shelter themselves from the fierce summer sun - a picture of exactly what Egypt's ailing economy does not need. Strikes spread across the country during the weeks after the 2011 uprising began, bringing Egypt's economy to its knees, a blow from which it has not recovered. Tourists and investors have stayed away, and foreign exchange reserves have tumbled to dangerously low levels. Spreading unrest While last year's broad labor unrest has abated, the strike by some 22,000 employees at the Misr factory already has spread to seven other textile firms, in both the public and private sectors, and labor activists are talking about a new nationwide ""workers' revolution."" Such talk may be premature, but it is hard to ignore the symbolism of this new unrest in Mahalla. It was here that Egyptians first tore down and burned a huge poster of Mubarak four years ago, as a protest over low wages and rising food prices mushroomed into a nationwide general strike calling for ""freedom and dignity"" and an end to official corruption and police torture. The strike inspired a nationwide youth movementand Facebook campaign that eventually became a major force in the 2011 revolution. But the fall of Mubarak has been followed by 18 months of drift in the way the country has been governed. Security has deteriorated, rubbish has piled up on the streets and police turn a blind eye to Cairo's steadily worsening traffic. Morsi's biggest challenge, said Mustapha Kamel al-Sayyid of the consultancy Partners in Development, is to meet the rising expectations of Egyptians while restoring not just security but also economic discipline, and grappling with the deterioration in public finances. ""The economy has stagnated since the revolution, and the government lacks revenue but it can't impose higher taxes,"" he said. ""It is a very delicate situation."" Egypt spends close to 10 percent of its national income on subsidies for food and fuel, a burden it can ill afford. Restoring discipline to public finances would be ""very difficult at the best of times,"" said Simon Williams, chief Middle East and North Africa economist at HSBC in Dubai. ""It is particularly difficult in such a politically charged environment, and even more difficult after 18 months of such mediocre economic activity."" http://www.cfr.org/egypt/reforming-egypts-untenable-subsidies/p27885"" title=""www.cfr.org""With each month that passes,"" Williams said, ""it becomes a harder challenge to restart the economy and create the economic conditions required to begin to fulfill the widespread expectations of the people."" Paralysis in Cairo Morsi, who took office June 30, had promised to move quickly to restore Egypt's battered economy. But in his first three weeks in office, he instead has become embroiled in a struggle for influence with Egypt's military leaders, who used the broad powers they assumed after the revolution to dismiss the newly elected parliament and curtail the president's authority. Uncertainty over who is running the country could also delay a much-needed loan from the International Monetary Fund, economists warn. Meanwhile, hopes that Morsi would move swiftly to appoint a new cabinet have been dashed, and one newspaper said an announcement would now have to wait until after the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which ends Aug. 18 - ""a major disappointment for the business community and the wider electorate,"" said Angus Blair, founder of the Signet economic and political think tank in Cairo. At the Misr factory, workers appealed to Morsi to intervene. Some blamed him for not acting sooner, but others said the strike was about working conditions and should not be used to score political points. Nevertheless, Khaled Ali, a lawyer, activist and failed candidate in the presidential election, warned that his former opponent needed to act swiftly to address the workers' grievances, as well as meet the nation's wider expectations. ""People were anticipating so much from the first 100 days of Morsi, but if he continues like this, if this struggle with the army goes on, I don't think people will be calm and stable,"" he said, after meeting with the striking workers in Mahalla. ""These protests are going to consolidate against him, and he will be in a very bad situation."" denyers@washpost.com Haitham Tabei contributed to this report. More world news coverage: - Syrian conflict spreads to commercial capital - Struggle over what to wear in Iran - Russian punk protesters stay in jail - Read more headlines from around the world Why we give foreign aid  Sequestration is not the best time to be doling out foreign aid, surely the most unpopular item in the federal budget. Especially when the recipient is President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt. Morsi is intent on getting the release of Omar Abdel-Rahman (the Blind Sheik), serving a life sentence for masterminding the 1993 World Trade Center attack that killed six and wounded more than a thousand. Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood is openly anti-Christian, anti-Semitic and otherwise prolifically intolerant. Just three years ago, Morsi called on Egyptians to nurse their children and grandchildren on hatred for Jews, whom he has called ""the descendants of apes and pigs."" Not exactly Albert Schweitzer. Or even Anwar Sadat. Which left a bad taste when Secretary of State John Kerry, traveling to Cairo, handed Morsi a cool $250 million. (A tenth of which would cover about 25 years of White House tours, no longer affordable under sequestration. Says the administration.) Nonetheless, we should not cut off aid to Egypt. It's not that we must blindly support unfriendly regimes. It is perfectly reasonable to cut off aid to governments that are intrinsically hostile and beyond our influence. Subsidizing enemies is merely stupid. But Egypt is not an enemy, certainly not yet. It may no longer be our strongest Arab ally, but it is still in play. The Brotherhood aims to establish an Islamist dictatorship. Yet it remains a considerable distance from having done so. Precisely why we should remain engaged. And engagement means using our economic leverage. Morsi has significant opposition. Six weeks ago, powerful anti-Brotherhood demonstrations broke out in major cities and have continued sporadically ever since. The presidential election that Morsi won was decided quite narrowly - three points, despite the Brotherhood's advantage of superior organization and a history of social service. Moreover, having forever been in opposition, on election day the Islamists escaped any blame for the state of the country. Now in power, they begin to bear responsibility for Egypt's miserable conditions - a collapsing economy, rising crime, social instability. Their aura is already dissipating. There is nothing inevitable about Brotherhood rule. The problem is that the secular democratic parties are fractured, disorganized and lacking in leadership. And are repressed by the increasingly authoritarian Morsi. His partisans have attacked demonstrators in Cairo. His security forces killed more than 40 in Port Said. He's been harassing journalists, suppressing freedom of speech, infiltrating the military and trying to subjugate the courts. He's already rammed through an Islamist constitution. He is now trying to tilt, even rig, parliamentary elections to the point that the opposition called for a boycott and an administrative court has just declared a suspension of the vote. Any foreign aid we give Egypt should be contingent upon a reversal of this repression and a granting of space to secular, democratic, pro-Western elements. That's where Kerry committed his mistake. Not in trying to use dollar diplomacy to leverage Egyptian behavior, but by exercising that leverage almost exclusively for economic, rather than political, reform. Kerry's major objective was getting Morsi to apply for a $4.8 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. Considering that some of this $4.8 billion ultimately comes from us, there's a certain comic circularity to this demand. What kind of concession is it when a foreign government is coerced into . . . taking yet more of our money? We have no particular stake in Egypt's economy. Our stake is in its politics. Yes, we would like to see a strong economy. But in a country ruled by the Muslim Brotherhood? Our interest is in a non-Islamist, nonrepressive, nonsectarian Egypt, ruled as democratically as possible. Why should we want a vibrant economy that maintains the Brotherhood in power? Our concern is Egypt's policies, foreign and domestic. If we're going to give foreign aid, it should be for political concessions - on unfettered speech, on an opposition free of repression, on alterations to the Islamist constitution, on open and fair elections. We give foreign aid for two reasons: (a) to support allies who share our values and our interests, and (b) to extract from less-than-friendly regimes concessions that either bring their policies more in line with ours or strengthen competing actors more favorably inclined toward American objectives. That's the point of foreign aid. It's particularly important in countries like Egypt, whose fate is in the balance. But it will only work if we remain clear-eyed about why we give all that money in the first place. letters@charleskrauthammer.com Mubarak trial stalls after judge withdraws  CAIRO - A new trial for deposed Egyptian autocrat Hosni Mubarak ended just minutes after it opened Saturday morning when the presiding judge withdrew, igniting shouts of frustration in the court. The recusal of Judge Mostafa Hassan Abdallah further delays a case that, for many Egyptians, has come to symbolize the elusiveness of justice in this tumultuous Arab nation more than two years after the revolution that many here had hoped would usher in a transparent democracy. The 84-year-old Mubarak, his two sons and several former security officials face charges related to corruption and the killing of protesters during Egypt's 18-day uprising in 2011. A judge overturned Mubarak's initial life sentence and ordered a retrial for all the defendants in January after both the defense and the prosecution filed appeals. Abdallah, who presided over a recent case related to violence allegedly perpetrated during the uprising, said Saturday that he was referring the Mubarak case to another court, citing ""uneasiness."" Legal experts say it could take weeks for a new judge to be appointed. The slow process of justice for Mubarak and other former officials has sown anger - and deep suspicion of the courts - in this country of 85 million. ""This whole institution of the judiciary is cast in shadows. It has taken a position against the people,"" said Amir Salem, an attorney for families of some of those killed during the uprising. Others have grown bored - or even sympathetic to the ailing Mubarak - as the court case slowly winds its way through a second year and many other ex-officials have been acquitted for lack of evidence. ""It's a cold case. You and I have to follow it, but everyone else is tired of it,"" said Saad Abdel Wahed, a retired head of the Giza Criminal Court. Growing frustration with the new Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi, and a floundering economy have deflected attention from the trial. Protests and repeated outbreaks of violence have rattled the country in recent months, upsetting plans for national elections and government negotiations for a badly needed loan from the International Monetary Fund. Mubarak, despite his reputed frailty, appeared alert and confident in the defendants' dock Saturday, waving to people in the courtroom and conversing with his sons. In the front row, Mubarak's attorney, Farid el-Deeb, smoked a cigar. ""When I saw Mubarak today wearing his sunglasses and smiling, you kind of knew what was going to happen,"" Abdel Wahed said. ""I don't like him, but we have this expression, 'You only appreciate your mother when you meet your stepmother.' The trial is just symbolic to people now.

But even before the first ballot is cast, tensions are rising over allegations of fraud that could undermine the legitimacy of the vote and the likelihood of a peaceful outcome. Mugabe, 89, in office since Zimbabwe gained its independence from Britain in 1980, is seeking another five-year term as president. Critics and analysts say that his loyalists have manipulated the voting process in myriad ways to try to ensure victory. There are reports of ""ghost voters"" and hundreds of thousands of deceased people on registration lists. Voters have complained about being improperly registered or not registered at all. And human rights activists allege intimidation and interference by the government, its military and security forces in the lead-up to the elections. Underscoring the heightened tensions, Mugabe's main opponent, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, who is challenging Mugabe for a third time, accused election officials last week of throwing away votes in his favor by about 70,000 police officers and soldiers who cast ballots early. Over the weekend Tsvangirai, 61, also declared that he had no confidence in the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission's ability to conduct a legitimate vote. He warned that if official results were delayed - as they were in the disputed 2008 elections - he would break the law and announce the election outcome. Wednesday's balloting comes as the southern African nation is emerging from a crippling economic crisis. At one point, inflation had soared to more than 500 billion percent in 2008 and economic output had sunk by 45 percent between 1999 and 2008, according to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Today, even as growth has slowed in the past two years and poverty remains widespread, Zimbabweans are in far better economic shape. But many analysts fear a recurrence of economic and political instability if the election results are again disputed - as well as a fresh eruption of the violence that marred the 2008 polls. ""A return to protracted political crisis, and possibly extensive violence, is likely, as Zimbabwe holds inadequately prepared presidential, parliamentary and local elections,"" said a report by the International Crisis Group. ""Conditions for a free and fair vote do not exist. Confidence in the process and institutions is low."" Zimbabwe was once a major corn exporter that helped feed the region, but its economy plunged into recession following seizures of white-owned commercial farms in 2000 on the orders of Mugabe and his Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front party, or ZANU-PF. Agricultural output declined, and the nation was debilitated by shortages of food and fuel, despite having some of the world's largest deposits of diamonds, gold, coal and platinum. After the 2008 vote, the electoral commission took five weeks to announce the results. Those tallies showed that Tsvangirai and his Movement for Democratic Change, or MDC, had won but not secured enough votes to avoid a runoff. The MDC accused Mugabe and ZANU-PF of vote-rigging, but that did not prevent a second round of voting. Tsvangirai later pulled out of the race, declaring that Mugabe's loyalists had killed more than 200 of his supporters. To defuse the crisis, the Southern African Development Community, a regional bloc, brokered a 2009 power-sharing deal between the two rivals, leaving Mugabe as president and Tsvangirai as prime minister. The MDC took control of many of the government's economic portfolios, while ZANU-PF retained control over the security ministries. Analysts and investors widely credit Tendai Biti, an MDC stalwart who is now the finance minister, with resuscitating the economy. He abolished the Zimbabwe dollar and allowed the use of the American dollar and other strong currencies, which helped slash inflation to single digits. Since 2009, the economy has grown every year. But the coalition government had always been a shaky partnership, and now the gloves are off. On Monday, Biti, who is also the MDC's secretary general, publicly complained that the electoral commission had given only ZANU-PF access to the voter registrations lists. ""With virtually a day to go to the election, no political party in Zimbabwe, other than ZANU-PF perhaps, has got a copy of the voters' roll,"" Biti told reporters at a news conference in Harare, the capital. Election officials at the news conference declined to address the allegations. Meanwhile, at his final campaign rally Sunday, Mugabe warned Tsvangirai that he would be arrested if he followed through on his intention to announce electoral results if the electoral commission was slow to release them. ""He knows that is not allowed by law,"" Mugabe told supporters. The commission ""is the only organization that can announce election results. I can tell you in advance that if you become a lawbreaker, the police will arrest you."" The allegations of vote tampering have been unfolding for several weeks. Earlier this month, the Research and Advocacy Unit, a Harare-based nongovernmental group, found that the voters' roll contains 1 million people who are either dead or have left the country, and 116,000 people over the age of 100, among other irregularities. The government tried to ban publication of the group's report. One Web site, MyZimVote.com, says it has received several hundred complaints of voter intimidation, fraud, incorrect registrations and other irregularities ahead of the vote. And last month, Human Rights Watch released a report alleging that the Zimbabwean military and security forces have been beating and intimidating Mugabe's opponents. ""With the security forces right up to the top leaders threatening and attacking Mugabe's perceived opponents, Zimbabweans have little faith in the upcoming elections,"" said Tiseke Kasambala, Africa advocacy director for the New York-based watchdog. ""Zimbabwe's unity government is going to have to rein in the security forces and keep them out of politics if the elections are going to have any meaning."" sudarsan.raghavan@washpost.com  Fighting Resumes in Sierra Leone  FREETOWN, Sierra Leone--An uneasy alliance between rebels and former junta soldiers has dissolved into bloodshed in northern Sierra Leone, where about 100 soldiers were killed in fighting last weekend, newspapers reported yesterday. The rebel Revolutionary United Front battled the former soldiers along a key road between the northern towns of Makeni and Lunsar, 45 miles northeast of Freetown, the Concord Times reported, citing accounts from refugees fleeing the region. Relations between the rebels and their allies from Sierra Leone's ousted junta have been strained since rebel leader Foday Sankoh and President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah signed a July 7 peace deal. The accord promised the rebels a power-sharing role in the government but made no specific mention of the former junta, which was ousted early last year by a West African intervention force.  Nigerian Money Laundering Investigated  GENEVA--Swiss judicial authorities have opened an inquiry into alleged money laundering and participation in a criminal organization involving Nigeria's late leader, Gen. Sani Abacha, and his entourage, the investigating magistrate said. Abacha; his eldest son, Muhammed Sani Abacha; his widow, Mariam; and his brother Abdulkadir are among those accused by Nigeria's elected government of having ""systematically plundered"" the country's central bank, a Swiss statement issued this month said. A Geneva lawyer representing the Nigerian government alleges that Abacha and his entourage diverted $ 2.2 billion from the central bank alone.  Russian Forces Near Chechen Capital  GROZNY, Russia--Exploding artillery shells rattled windows and spread fear in the Chechen capital, as the heaviest fighting in weeks brought Russian tanks and soldiers near the city limits. Chechen fighters battled the Russians within two miles of Grozny's northern edge, while more fighting raged to the east of the city. Russian jets and artillery elsewhere bombarded at least seven towns and settlements across Chechnya, officers on both "23-Jul-12,KENYA (98%);,"MAHALLA EL-KUBRA, Egypt - Four years ago, protests in this Egyptian cotton mill city sowed the seeds of the revolution that ultimately toppled President Hosni Mubarak. Today Mahalla is again seething, as a strike by tens of thousands of textile workers entered its second week Sunday, posing an early test for Egypt's new president, Mohamed Morsi. The spreading labor unrest threatens one of Egypt's key export industries at a time when the country teeters on the brink of a balance of payments crisis. It also signifies how expectations that were raised by last year's revolution have remained largely unfulfilled, and how that frustration could boil over into more unrest, with further disastrous consequences for the economy. ""Mahalla created the spirit of the revolution,"" said Hamdi Nasheby, 60, a white-bearded man dressed in a flowing grey gown, or jalabiya, who said he had worked at the factory in the fertile heart of the Nile Delta for 45 years. ""But now that the revolution has happened and Egyptians have gained their rights, they have forgotten the suffering of Mahalla - the revolution has forgotten us."" Around him, dozens of his fellow workers gestured angrily on a recent afternoon, shouting over each other as they tried to explain their demands: a share in the profits of the sprawling state-owned Misr Spinning and Weaving Co., better health-care and retirement packages, a raise in monthly wages from 700 to 1,000 Egyptian pounds ($115 to $165), and the dismissal of the company's chief executive. Behind them, the factory gates were padlocked, the wide concrete smokestacks idle and the sandstone administration buildings vacant as hundreds of their colleagues sat under tarpaulins to shelter themselves from the fierce summer sun - a picture of exactly what Egypt's ailing economy does not need. Strikes spread across the country during the weeks after the 2011 uprising began, bringing Egypt's economy to its knees, a blow from which it has not recovered. Tourists and investors have stayed away, and foreign exchange reserves have tumbled to dangerously low levels. Spreading unrest While last year's broad labor unrest has abated, the strike by some 22,000 employees at the Misr factory already has spread to seven other textile firms, in both the public and private sectors, and labor activists are talking about a new nationwide ""workers' revolution."" Such talk may be premature, but it is hard to ignore the symbolism of this new unrest in Mahalla. It was here that Egyptians first tore down and burned a huge poster of Mubarak four years ago, as a protest over low wages and rising food prices mushroomed into a nationwide general strike calling for ""freedom and dignity"" and an end to official corruption and police torture. The strike inspired a nationwide youth movement and Facebook campaign that eventually became a major force in the 2011 revolution.          But the fall of Mubarak has been followed by 18 months of drift in the way the country has been governed. Security has deteriorated, rubbish has piled up on the streets and police turn a blind eye to Cairo's steadily worsening traffic. Morsi's biggest challenge, said Mustapha Kamel al-Sayyid of the consultancy Partners in Development, is to meet the rising expectations of Egyptians while restoring not just security but also economic discipline, and grappling with the deterioration in public finances. ""The economy has stagnated since the revolution, and the government lacks revenue but it can't impose higher taxes,"" he said. ""It is a very delicate situation."" Egypt spends close to 10 percent of its national income on subsidies for food and fuel, a burden it can ill afford. Restoring discipline to public finances would be ""very difficult at the best of times,"" said Simon Williams, chief Middle East and North Africa economist at HSBC in Dubai. ""It is particularly difficult in such a politically charged environment, and even more difficult after 18 months of such mediocre economic activity."" ""With each month that passes,"" Williams said, ""it becomes a harder challenge to restart the economy and create the economic conditions required to begin to fulfill the widespread expectations of the people."" Paralysis in Cairo          Morsi, who took office June 30, had promised to move quickly to restore Egypt's battered economy. But in his first three weeks in office, he instead has become embroiled in a struggle for influence with Egypt's military leaders, who used the broad powers they assumed after the revolution to dismiss the newly elected parliament and curtail the president's authority. Uncertainty over who is running the country could also delay a much-needed loan from the International Monetary Fund, economists warn. Meanwhile, hopes that Morsi would move swiftly to appoint a new cabinet have been dashed, and one newspaper said an announcement would now have to wait until after the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which ends Aug. 18 - ""a major disappointment for the business community and the wider electorate,"" said Angus Blair, founder of the Signet economic and political think tank in Cairo. At the Misr factory, workers appealed to Morsi to intervene. Some blamed him for not acting sooner, but others said the strike was about working conditions and should not be used to score political points. Nevertheless, Khaled Ali, a lawyer, activist and failed candidate in the presidential election, warned that his former opponent needed to act swiftly to address the workers' grievances, as well as meet the nation's wider expectations. ""People were anticipating so much from the first 100 days of Morsi, but if he continues like this, if this struggle with the army goes on, I don't think people will be calm and stable,"" he said, after meeting with the striking workers in Mahalla. ""These protests are going to consolidate against him, and he will be in a very bad situation."" denyers@washpost.com Haitham Tabei contributed to this report.

If he is found guilty on Monday, a former member of Kenya's Parliament will be sentenced to death by hanging. Officially, the former official, Koigi wa Wamwere, is charged with attempted robbery with violence, an offense that carries a mandatory death sentence here. The police contend that he raided a police station for weapons, presumably to use for an insurrection. Mr. Wamwere is a longtime political dissident who has been imprisoned four times before and has been held for long periods without trial. He contends that he is being persecuted for his political beliefs, and Amnesty International and Western diplomats believe the charges against him are fabricated and the evidence questionable. This high-profile trial is seen by many diplomats as a sign that President Daniel arap Moi may be sliding back from his commitment to democratic reform toward the political harassment and violence, tribal divisions and widespread corruption of the past. Three years after its first multi-party elections, Kenya is still very much a state governed by one political party and its leader. Mrs. Moi's face is on the currency. His statements open evening news broadcasts on the radio and television stations, which are Government-owned. There are Moi airports and Moi schools, and each town has a Moi Avenue, reflecting his 17 years in power. Mr. Moi's portrait hangs in all public offices and stores. But Kenya is also a country at a critical crossroads. By liberalizing its economy and giving its citizens a degree of political empowerment, the Government of the 71-year-old Mr. Moi has discovered that it can no longer turn back to autocratic rule. In 1992 elections, though he retained power, only 37 percent of Kenyans voted for Mr. Moi. Yet as his governing party sees its power eroding, it is increasingly returning to harsh and oppressive tactics. The 19-month-long Wamwere trial has attracted considerable attention outside Kenya. The Government contends that Mr. Wamwere and three men who are on trial with him were part of a group that invaded the police station and that three other members were killed. The police produced three bodies, but it is unclear whether the attack actually took place or whether the men who died were associated with Mr. Wamwere. The judge delayed the verdict by a week, a sign that Mr. Moi's Government, under heavy international pressure, might be rethinking the verdict, diplomats say. Kenya must at least take notice of international pressure because it needs Western assistance and international investment. Eleven million of Kenya's 26 million people enter the job market each year, and the country's infrastructure is crumbling. In the past, responding to aid donors, Kenya has made strides in liberalizing its economy, eliminating price controls, reducing its civil service and enforcing greater monetary discipline. But this year, citing human rights abuses, corruption in high places and backtracking on crucial agricultural reforms, the Western donors are hedging on promises of $850 million in aid. Germany and Denmark have said their aid will be dependent on whether political reform continues. ""Until recently there was every intention to convict,"" Robert Shaw, a Nairobi businessman and a founding member of the opposition group Safina, said of the Wamwere trial. ""The trial has been an absolute farce,"" he said. ""What you're seeing is a backtracking of democracy. The government is paranoid about anyone who looks like they could be a credible leader. There's a siege mentality. Leaders of Safina have been arrested as harassment, and some were recently beaten up in front of the courthouse in Nairobi by members of the youth wing of the governing party. Mr. Moi has called Mr. Shaw a hyena. ""What is increasingly happening is that people are getting more and more disillusioned with the political process,"" Mr. Shaw said. Many Kenyans and diplomats say they expect the next two years, leading up to the 1997 presidential elections, to be a volatile period and a test of whether the multiparty system will continue to work. ""In Kenya it's two steps forward and one step back,"" a Western diplomat in Nairobi said. ""No one likes what has happened here in the past eight months. It's been one incident after another of repression. There is a strong element of violence in this culture. And there is still the mentality that my political opponent is my enemy."" Mr. Wamwere, who recently allied himself with Safina, is seen as particularly threatening to the Government. He is a member of Kenya's largest tribe, the Kikuyu, and draws a large following in the Rift Valley, the country's most fertile and fought-over region. Government-organized violence there in the last three years has left thousands of Kikuyu homeless, human rights officials say. In contrast, many members of top Government and military circles, including the President, are from the minority Kalenjin tribe or from other minority groups like the Maasai. Political liberalization has had its most negative effect on Mr. Moi's party, the Kenya African National Union. Although Mr. Moi is expected to run again if he can, political jockeying over presidential succession has torn at the ranks and increased the ruthlessness of its leaders. With this focus on the future, Western diplomats have been describing Kenya as already being in the ""post Moi"" era. ""Multipartyism has changed everything,"" said John Githongo, a columnist for the East African, a English-language weekly, who believes that ultimately Kenya will become stable politically. ""The President has lost his ability to maneuver. I think things will get more repressive, but more repressive erratically. The Government is lashing out. Increasingly many of these threats are becoming empty."" Mr. Githongo attributed the recent repressive actions to the fierce succession battle in Mr. Moi's party. ""I think in the past eight months Mr. Moi has run out of ideas on how to deal with the situation,"" he said. ""His power to make a positve change is no longer there."" The three main opposition parties -- which are fractured, disorganized and tribally based -- are not seen as posing a viable threat to the governing party. Some of their leaders have defected to the governing party, which has paid off their debts and given them cash payments. The newest party, Safina, is an exception. It is led by the renowned paleontologist Richard Leakey, who has vowed to ""clean up"" Kenya. The Government has so far delayed officially registering Safina, and Mr. Moi has opened a personal crusade against Mr. Leakey, who is white. The President has accused him of being a colonialist and a racist. But the attacks have actually enhanced the party's image both domestically and internationally, Mr. Shaw says, and in a country with a minuscule white population, the overwhelming majority of its supporters are black. As aid donors have exerted pressure on Mr. Moi, they have expressed frustration that little is being done to tackle corruption in the upper ranks of the Government. Focusing on Kenya's most notorious banking scandal, which surfaced in 1992, the International Monetary Fund has suspended $200 million in aid until the Government determines what happened to an estimate $350 million dollars from the Central bank of Kenya. The Disbursements are approved by Vice President George Saitoti, a former mathematics professor who was then also Minister of Finance. Some were for payments to a company called Goldenburg International, under a program to compensate exporters that do business in Kenya, for fictitious gold and diamond exports. Some of the transactions also involved treasury bills for which the Central Bank of Kenya never received compensation. Western donors and the opposition want a thorough investigation that would include examining Mr. Saitoti's role in those transactions. So far there has been no action by the Government. Even if the Government yields and acquits Mr. Wamwere, political dissent in Kenya is still limited, and certain topics cannot be touched. Insulting the President is an arrestable offense. The brother of a former member of Parliament was recently arrested for ""imagining the death"" of Mr. Moi. Kenyan journalist know they cannot publish names and details of accusation against high-ranking Government officials in corruption cases unless they are prepared to face harassment and arrest. ""We're sailing too close to the wind,"" Mr. Shaw said. ""I think it's incredibly dangerous. You can stretch an elastic band but eventually it breaks.""

(The New York Times)"9-Sep-12,COTE D'IVOIRE (95%); GABON (94%); TOGO (94%); GUINEA (94%); AFRICA (94%); WESTERN AFRICA (93%); SENEGAL (92%); MALI (92%),"DAKAR, Senegal -- Tear gas fired on hundreds of demonstrators in Togo. Mass arrests of protesters in Guinea. Guerrilla assaults against police officers and soldiers in Ivory Coast. Rock- and bottle-throwing antigovernment militants suppressed with force in Gabon. It has been a hot summer in the capitals of Africa's west coast. Authority has been challenged -- in the streets, by ambush at night, with stones or guns in broad daylight -- and the governments have struck back with their customary heavy hand. Regardless of whether those governments are considered legitimate by outside observers and governments, as in the case of Guinea and Ivory Coast, or suspect, as with Togo and Gabon, it has been a summer of siege. Political evolution on the continent's western side is often a series of eruptions: order appears to be established, and then the volcano explodes again. In Togo and Gabon, the levers of power have long seemed immutable, dominated by the same families for decades. In Guinea and Ivory Coast, both on the mend after years of upheaval, democratic order seemed to arrive at last only recently. But all of these nations bubble with uncertainty beneath the surface. Western donors and officials who visit the West African capitals to offer congratulations on stability -- the new World Bank president was in Abidjan, the Ivorian commercial capital, last week -- should be warned: their compliments may be premature. Legitimacy, it turns out, is not conferred from the outside. Witness the disaster of Mali. Its government collapsed like a house of cards earlier this year to the shock of complacent outsiders, who had hailed the country as a democratic exemplar. But it fell to knowing nods from Malians, who had long considered it too corrupt to stand. All four of this summer's other hot spots illustrate a persistent undercurrent of political life on the continent's west side: where there are internal doubts about legitimacy, stability is an illusion. Protesters and rioters will go into the street, and armed men will carry out nighttime attacks, whether Western embassies approve of the governments in place or not. Add to this a big dose of income inequality -- Africa is woefully lopsided, belying the souped-up African growth rates trumpeted by development banks and publicists -- and volatility is all but guaranteed. This year's season of low-intensity political violence has called into question that rosy growth narrative. Guinea is a particularly troubling example of the region's summer of trouble. In 2010, it managed a legitimate presidential election, its first ever, after more than 50 years of authoritarian oppression. A veteran leader of the opposition, Alpha Cond, a man imprisoned and exiled by the country's longtime tyrants, was elected in a vote judged fair. And yet late last month, his police officers were rounding up dozens of demonstrators, firing tear gas into the house of a political opponent, shooting live ammunition at protesters in the capital's ramshackle neighborhoods, and beating and arresting them. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights denounced the ''excessive force'' used by Mr. Cond's police. In one case, the police fired on a bulletproof car carrying the top opposition leaders, the leaders said. Mr. Cond's country could no longer be considered exemplary. What happened? The opposition suspects him of wanting to rig much-postponed legislative elections. The machinery of the election, critical in countries with no democratic tradition, was thought to be in the hands of a Cond ally. Memories of ethnic persecution simmered. The election date has been repeatedly pushed back and in place of a Parliament there is a ''National Transitional Council,'' nearly two years after Mr. Cond's election. The 2010 election that had appeared to bestow legitimacy did so only partly. The underlying problems -- weak institutions, ethnic hatred, brutal security forces -- were not resolved by the vote. That good-conduct medal granted from the outside had little meaning to the people of a country just nine from the bottom on the United Nations' Human Development Index, where deadly cholera is a regular summer visitor because of the near-total absence of sanitation in the capital's poor districts. The same questions of internal legitimacy are true in Ivory Coast. President Alassane Ouattara, a former top International Monetary Fund official, won his election legitimately but had to be installed by force, with the aid of the French military, after a short but bloody civil war in which some 3,000 died. Yet nearly half the country voted for Mr. Ouattara's opponent, Laurent Gbagbo, and that half has not forgotten either him or the role of the French in his downfall. Mr. Gbagbo, who had dug himself in and refused to accept the election result, is in jail awaiting trial for crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court. Substantial numbers of his fellow citizens agree with neither those accusations nor Mr. Ouattara's right to govern. Over the last month, attacks on Mr. Ouattara's soldiers and others have killed around 20, sharply rattling a fledgling government that has been piling up congratulatory handshakes for righting what was once the region's strongest economy. On Aug. 16, just outside Abidjan, attackers went after a police station as well as a military camp, killed three civilians and freed dozens of inmates from a prison. Mr. Ouattara's government blamed what remains of Mr. Gbagbo's political party for the attacks and promptly went about arresting some of its top officials. The party denied it and accused the Ouattara camp of torturing those it had arrested. Outtara officials have labeled the party ''terrorists.'' A national reconciliation commission has been moribund. Whatever his rightful claim to legitimacy in the eyes of outsiders, Mr. Ouattara is still far from a similar standing with many of his countrymen. Where legitimacy has been questioned from the outset, leaders can expect trouble. That series of events has been playing out for weeks in the small coastal nation of Togo, where antigovernment demonstrators have repeatedly filled the streets of the capital, Lom. The police fired tear gas at hundreds of them last week, just as they had the week before. As in Guinea, the demonstrators of Save Togo fear that coming parliamentary elections will be rigged. The women of Save Togo have even called for a national sex strike. The country has been run by the same family for more than 40 years. When the dictator Gen. Gnassingb Eyadma died after 38 years in power in 2005, the military put his son Faure Gnassingb in power. Not surprisingly, he won a dubious election later that year -- a victory accompanied by the deaths of nearly 800 protesters and the flight across borders of thousands more, according to Togolese human rights groups -- and again in 2010. This year's demonstrators, inspired partly by the Arab Spring, appear to have reason to mistrust elections managed by the ruling clan. ''We're asking for a radical change in our country,'' said Jil-Benot Afangbedji, a lawyer who helps run Save Togo. ''We want to establish a nation truly founded on laws, one that respects the rights of men.'' The protesters are unlikely to force the president from office, said the leading Togolese political scientist, Comi Toulabor. And yet ''the government has been weakened'' because of them, he said. In Gabon, the situation is similar: violent protests against a family, the Bongos, that has ruled the small-scale petrostate for more than 40 years. Even if Ali Bongo really won the election to succeed his father in 2009, his legitimacy has been questioned from the start, simply because of his last name. The police broke up a protest spearheaded by a returning opposition leader with tear gas two weeks ago, the most violent outbreak since postelection riots in 2009. Moreover, the unrest seems unlikely to go away, for a basic reason. ''The Togolese are not eating three times a day,'' Mr. Afangbedji said. ''The authorities are deaf to our demands. But we are not going to shut up.''"18-Oct-12,ANGOLA (99%); AFRICA (94%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (93%); BOTSWANA (92%); NIGERIA (79%),"LUANDA, Angola -- Angola's government announced Wednesday the creation of a sovereign wealth fund that will invest profits from oil sales in businesses in an effort to diversify the country's economy and spread prosperity beyond the small elite that has benefited from Angola's outsize economic growth. With start-up capital of $5 billion, the fund will be the second richest in sub-Saharan Africa after Botswana's. There, a portion of the proceeds of the diamond industry have been socked away for almost two decades. The Angolan fund, which will focus on investments in Africa's booming hotel industry and large infrastructure projects, seeks to wean the economy from oil, a finite resource, to a more diversified and sustainable base, said Jos Filomeno de Sousa dos Santos, a son of President Jos Eduardo dos Santos, and a member of the fund's board. ''The economy is very one sided and very correlated to the volatility of oil prices,'' the younger Mr. dos Santos said in an interview. ''The aim is to create wealth for future generations.'' Angola is sub-Saharan Africa's second-biggest oil producer after Nigeria, with an output of about 1.8 million barrels of crude a day. Oil accounts for nearly all of the country's export earnings and almost half of its gross domestic product. Many resource-rich countries have created funds that invest broadly to hedge against fluctuating commodity prices, the biggest being oil-rich Norway's government pension fund. Some American states, like Alaska and Wyoming, have funds that either directly pay citizens a dividend of mineral wealth or invest it on their behalf. Oil wealth has transformed Angola's seaside capital, Luanda, building a glittering skyline and jamming its streets with expensive sport utility vehicles. After decades of civil war fueled in part by the country's rich diamond deposits, Angola has been at peace for the last decade, and it has prospered mightily. Oil wealth has also made Angola one of the world's most unequal nations, and poverty remains rampant, especially in rural areas. Furthermore, the government seems to subsist from barrel to barrel, with little stashed away for a rainy day. When oil prices dropped amid the financial crisis in 2008, Angola was forced to ask the International Monetary Fund for help. But the government's bookkeeping is notoriously opaque. The monetary fund said this year that $32 billion spent by the state oil company, Sonangol, over several years, could not be accounted for. Anticorruption activists have long accused top government officials of enriching themselves while leaving the masses to struggle without clean water, decent housing and affordable health care. Mr. dos Santos said in the interview that the fund would follow a clearly delineated investment strategy and open its books to annual independent audits. ''We are committed to transparency,'' he said. The fund's elegant offices, a few floors down from the oil industry services company Halliburton, are decorated with raw silk wallpaper, designer furniture and black lacquer fittings."22-Feb-13,ANGOLA (99%); UNITED STATES (94%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%); NIGERIA (79%); AFRICA (79%),"President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry need to pay attention to Egypt - now. The most populous Arab country, poster child of the Arab Spring, faces a looming economic crisis and a widespread breakdown in law and order, including increasingly prevalent crime and rape. Either will cripple Egypt's faltering effort to become a stable democracy. The Obama administration has treated Egypt primarily as an economic problem and has urged Cairo to move quickly to satisfy International Monetary Fund (IMF) demands to qualify for financing. But there is no separating Egypt's economic crisis from its political crisis - or from the failures of its current government. Egypt's economy is struggling and disorder is rampant primarily because the country's leaders the past two years - first the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, now President Mohamed Morsi - have failed to build an inclusive political process. Until they do, no amount of IMF funding will make a difference. Although Morsi won a narrow victory last summer, he has yet to learn what it means to lead in a democratic society. His Muslim Brotherhood is Egypt's strongest political force, but it does not command a majority of public support. It cannot simply force its will on the nation, especially one still aroused by the spirit of revolution. Morsi can hardly take on urgent tasks, such as the cutting of wasteful fuel subsidies and the reformation of a corrupt interior ministry and police force, when much of the country is against him and ready to take to the streets at the least provocation. Under Morsi's rule, Egyptian society has become polarized between Islamists and non- Islamists. Enraging the political opposition late last year, he railroaded through a new constitution that contains inadequate protections for the rights of women and non-Muslims and leaves open the possibility of Islamic clerical oversight of legislation. Ignoring protests about the flawed process by which the constitution was drafted and passed, Morsi is moving ahead to legislative elections based on an electoral law to which the opposition objects. Meanwhile, his government has cracked down on journalists, brought spurious charges against opposition leaders and limited the right to public protests. It is considering legislation that would constrain the activities of non-governmental organizations even more than Hosni Mubarak did. The increasingly desperate secular opposition parties have formed a ""National Salvation Front,"" but under the surface they are divided between those who want to force Morsi to compromise and those who want to force him from power. Even though most favor the economic reforms necessary to get an IMF loan, many feel they must mobilize street protests against any Morsi action. The result is that, with Egypt at the edge of bankruptcy - it has enough reserves to pay for only three more months of food and fuel imports - the government and the opposition are locked in a game of chicken. The economy is sinking, political conflict is rising and the security situation is deteriorating. Washington's response to this crisis has largely been business as usual. Just as the United States once clung to Mubarak, the Obama administration has hewed closely to Morsi, offering a visit to Washington and continuing to deliver the annual $1.3 billion in military assistance - including a recent shipment of F-16 aircraft. The administration's response to Morsi's majoritarian bullying has been muted. Egypt's opposition and nonpartisan human rights groups believe, understandably, that Washington has resumed ignoring undemocratic practices so long as the Egyptian government protects U.S. strategic interests. Outside of opening new contacts with the ruling Muslim Brotherhood, there has been no fundamental reassessment of U.S. policy toward Egypt since Mubarak's removal in 2011. Our military and economic aid packages remain the same - except that nearly all democracy and civil-society assistance has been cut off. It's time for a new approach. Both the administration and Congress need to fully review military and economic assistance to Egypt. What does the Egyptian army need to bring security to the Sinai? Probably not F-16s. What conditions should Congress place on aid? Previous packages have appropriately been conditioned on progress toward democracy, but the administration has insisted on a national security waiver and has exercised it to provide the aid regardless of Egypt's behavior. Perhaps Congress should not permit such a waiver in the next aid bill. As for Morsi's planned trip to Washington, it would be better to hold that invitation until he demonstrates a sincere commitment to working with all of Egyptian society and allowing genuine freedom to all citizens. That means supporting a law that meets international standards on regulating civil society, allowing watchdog organizations to operate freely and finally resolving the controversial status of foreign and foreign-funded NGOs. It means ending the persecution of journalists and opposition figures, committing to reform the police and hold them accountable, and building a consensus on such critical matters as the constitution and electoral law. The United States made a strategic error, for years, by coddling Mubarak, and his refusal to carry out reforms produced the revolution of Tahrir Square. We repeat the error by coddling Morsi at this critical moment. The United States needs to use all its options - military aid, economic aid, and U.S. influence with the IMF and other international lenders - to persuade Morsi to compromise with secular politicians and civil-society leaders on political and human rights issues to rebuild security and get the economy on track.

Angola's Elusive Oil Riches  Last month, the Angolan government did something startling: it announced that an oil deal signed with ChevronTexaco would bring the country $300 million. The disclosure of a single figure may not seem a triumph of transparency, but in the past Angola -- like many other countries -- treated its oil revenue as a state secret. Revealing its oil payments is the first of many anticorruption measures that Angola desperately needs. Angola is the second-largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa, after Nigeria. Yet its people are by some measures the world's most miserable. These two facts coexist in part because more than $4 billion in oil receipts have disappeared from Angola's treasury in the last six years, according to the International Monetary Fund. That figure is about equal to the government's total social spending for the same period. The misuse of oil revenues robs Angolans of more than health care and education. The opportunity to steal millions gives the country's leaders a reason never to risk this privilege by democratizing. In the last few years, countries around the world have agreed to make reforms to promote accountability in the industries that most easily lend themselves to corruption and mismanagement: oil, gas and mining. Angola has not joined them, despite pressures from citizens' groups, oil companies and the monetary fund. Desperate for loans, Angola has repeatedly agreed to carry out the reforms required by the I.M.F., then violated its promises. When the oil company BP announced in 2001 that it would publish what it paid Angola, the government threatened to cancel its contracts. Today there is some hope that Angola will begin to use its oil receipts to benefit its people. The end of a 27-year civil war in 2002 deprived the government of its perennial excuse for not improving wretched living conditions. Once dependent on the Soviet Union and Cuba, Angolan officials are now trying to establish relationships with more countries and world institutions. In addition to announcing the ChevronTexaco figure, Angola also released some reports by an international accounting firm hired to track oil revenue, an I.M.F. requirement. But it should release all the reports in full, audit its state oil company and disclose all information related to its oil income. The I.M.F. has been admirably firm in insisting on these changes. The United States, a buyer of one-third of Angola's oil, has not. When Jose Eduardo dos Santos, Angola's president, went to Washington last month, Bush administration officials said disappointingly little in public about the need for more transparency. In December, Washington even deemed Angola eligible for trade preferences, based on a set of criteria that are supposed to include corruption-related policies. That was a mistake. Change will come to countries like Angola only if outsiders are resolute about accountability."2-Apr-14,CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC (94%); COTE D'IVOIRE (93%); SENEGAL (92%); MALI (92%); AFRICA (92%); FRANCE (79%),"DAKAR, Senegal -- The recent near-death experiences of a number of African states should have, in theory, concentrated the minds of leaders who inherited their shaky remains. Bad government -- corrupt, nepotistic and ineffectual -- led directly to collapse in the Central African Republic, Mali and Ivory Coast over the last four years. Now new leaders are attempting to build on what is left in the countries, which were forced to turn to outside intervention -- i.e., France -- to forestall blood baths. But already there are disturbing signs that the countries have not learned from old mistakes. Government by patronage appears to be a habit not even violent upheaval can shake. Before, in all three countries, former top officials and their entourages were implicated in profiting from the state. Ministries were stuffed with patronage appointees and relatives of leaders. Institutions that were already weak disintegrated further under the strain of government misuse, popular anger boiled over, and thousands died in the subsequent coups, civil wars and rebel takeovers. All three of these trouble spots show signs of falling into the same trap again. Perhaps the most striking example is in the sickliest of them, the Central African Republic, a country gripped by violent interethnic and sectarian clashes where a fifth of the population has been uprooted by rebel incursion and a subsequent undeclared civil war. The new interim president, Catherine Samba-Panza, has appointed a plethora of ministers, minister-counselors, friends and hangers-on -- well over 20, by most counts. Her daughter is the director of her cabinet; a number of former aides of the deposed and discredited Michel Djotodia, the rebel leader who had ruled the country, have been recycled as top advisers; and many in the new government are from the president's home region. Meanwhile, every day brings a new harvest of killings. Last Thursday night, 11 more were killed, including several children, when a grenade was tossed into a crowd of Christian mourners in Bangui. More were killed over the weekend in clashes between African peacekeepers and Christian militias. Elsewhere in the country the remnants of once-flourishing Muslim minorities are cowering under the protection of international troops, besieged by the militias. Mrs. Samba-Panza was appointed in extremis in late January by a temporary Parliament amid outside hopes that she could at least begin to clean up the mess. But she is still having great difficulty paying civil servants without dollars from outside. On the streets of Bangui, disillusion has already set in with a government in name only that seems incapable of controlling anything except its own disbursement of favors. The Central African Republic's current troubles have nearly erased memories of similar internecine strife, already three years distant, in Ivory Coast. Early warning signs of bad government are nonetheless popping up there, despite a surging growth rate hovering around 9 percent, lifted by the country's position as the world's leading cocoa producer along with substantial public investment in roads, bridges and other infrastructure. But in a recent report, the International Monetary Fund primly took note of what has become a source of scandalized commentary in Abidjan, the economic capital: a proliferation of no-bid, single-source public contracts. The I.M.F. only registered a promise by ''the authorities'' to ''reduce the share of noncompetitive public sector contracts.'' The authoritative French newsletter La Lettre du Continent, on the other hand, wrote recently that a number of these contracts have benefited those in the close orbit of president Alassane Ouattara -- himself a former high-ranking I.M.F. official. The report has not been denied by the Ivorian government. The odor of influence-peddling boosts a virulent opposition still smarting over its defeat in the country's brief civil war of three years ago. In Mali, a government of self-enriching cronies in the 2000s helped hollow out the army, leaving it incapable of confronting jihadists who took over half the country in 2012. The new president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, elected after French troops chased the Islamists out, reassured international donors pledging billions by promising reforms from top to bottom. But already a complaisant National Assembly -- the country's Parliament -- has chosen his son Karim to lead one of its most important committees, on national defense; Karim's father-in-law, meanwhile, has been chosen as the Parliament's new president. Is the cycle of internal rot among some African governments, and subsequent debacle, inevitable? Perhaps not. Stopping it, however, requires more vigilant attention to good-government practices from the donors on whom many of these countries depend."12-Jun-14,NIGERIA (93%); EGYPT (92%); AFRICA (79%),"When Seun Kuti had his shirt off, dancing through the end of a sweaty, magnificently funky set at the Highline Ballroom on Tuesday night, the tattoo across his muscular shoulders was visible: ''Fela Lives.'' Fela Anikulapo Kuti, Seun's father, was the creator of the hardheaded, protest-minded Nigerian funk called Afrobeat, which has now spread worldwide. When Fela died in 1997, the 14-year-old Seun took over as the singer, alto saxophonist and leader of Fela's band, Egypt 80. Since then, Seun Kuti has emerged as far more than a caretaker for his father's style. In his own songs -- particularly those on his new album with Egypt 80, ''A Long Way to the Beginning'' (Knitting Factory) -- Seun Kuti makes sure that Afrobeat still bristles. Where Fela's music often moved at smoldering medium tempos, Seun's newer songs are faster, more insistent. The arrangements have added new layers of dissonance to give the songs more bite. And the underlying call and response of Afrobeat, with terse motifs traded among the band's percussion, horns, guitars and singers, has turned denser and less symmetrical; now, little overlapping outbursts cascade across the band, like sporadic flash fires. Songs may have just two chords, but as they stretch out, they reveal dozens of compositional ideas. Between the two generations of Kutis, the targets of the lyrics have changed very little. Like his father, Seun Kuti lashes out at corruption, economic inequality, indifferent governments and predatory Western financial interests, as he did in the hurtling, furious ''I.M.F.'' He introduced ''African Airways'' as ''a parody about the African economic system,'' with a Western pilot, an African co-pilot, World Bank radar and Chinese engines; eight minutes into its brisk, chattering modal groove, the percussion erupted for ''heavy turbulence!'' Partway through the set, Mr. Kuti launched into a lecture that delved into economic strife, food supplies and -- moving forward from his father's male chauvinism -- respect for women's intellectual power. That led into a song, in Fela's steadfast, slow-rolling style, that paid tribute to the ''Black Woman'': ''She struggle to go to school/she struggle to vote.'' Robert Glasper, the genre-stretching jazz keyboardist, produced ''A Long Way to the Beginning'' with Mr. Kuti, and he sat in on ''Higher Consciousness,'' a song about unrest and violence in Nigeria. Mr. Glasper meshed its groove with Minimalist repetition of percussive chords and arpeggios and a suggestion of ''A Love Supreme'' -- a more benign Western intervention. Throughout the set, the music changed constantly as the propulsion surged; the power of the rhythms redoubled the urgency of the messages, while the two backup singers rarely stopped shimmying. Mr. Kuti's Afrobeat makes its politics physical, its anger into momentum."27-Aug-14,KENYA (95%); AFRICA (79%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%);,"Do you Read In?

(Washington Post) But Obama is nearing a decision to aid Turkmen minorities in the town of Amerli, which is under siege by ISIS militants. The U.S. is pushing Australia, Britain, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the UAE to increase support for moderate rebels in Syria. (New York Times) -- The administration is working to forge agreement on a broad climate change agreement that would cut fossil fuel emissions without requiring ratification from Congress. The agreement would be signed at a 2015 U.N. summit meeting in Paris. The agreement would ""name and shame"" countries that didn't go along with the agreement. The administration recognizes that getting two-thirds in the Senate just isn't going to happen right now. (New York Times) -- An Egyptian-brokered cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip is holding after going into effect on Tuesday. A U.N. field reporting team arrived in Gaza, estimating the Strip's economic losses at $4.2 billion in the seven weeks since fighting began. Hamas declared victory, but the peace deal goes only as far as a 2012 agreement that ended the last outbreak of violence. Relief aid and construction materials will be allowed into Gaza, and fishermen can venture up to six miles offshore, twice the distance they were allowed to travel. (Washington Post) -- Campaign spending on about 125 ballot measures in 41 states is likely to top $1 billion for the first time this year. Democrats are increasingly using initiatives to drive turnout, as with minimum wage measures in Arkansas and Alaska and a medical marijuana initiative in Florida. Republicans tried the same thing in 2004 with same-sex marriage bans in nearly a dozen states. In a close election, the calculus goes, every extra vote counts. -- Corporations and special interests, too, are increasingly turning to the ballot box to improve their bottom lines. Casino measures in several states will draw millions in spending. A pair of measures relating to medical malpractice in California are expected to cost upwards of $100 million, and GMO labeling initiatives in Oregon and Colorado will draw tens of millions more. (Washington Post) -- IMF chief Christine Lagarde has been placed under official investigation for negligence in a corruption probe stemming from her tenure as France's finance minister.

(Huffington Post) Kenya and the Cult Of the 'Big Man'; Western Pressure Could Help Stop the Rot  IF YOU took a quarter-century worth of His Excellencies the African Leader and tossed them in a blender, you would come up with a Big Man like this: His face is on the money. His photograph hangs in every office in his realm. His ministers wear gold pins with tiny photographs of him on the lapels of their tailored pin-striped suits. He names streets, football stadiums, hospitals and universities after himself. He carries a silver-inlaid ivory mace or an ornately carved walking stick or fly whisk or a chiefly stool. He insists on being called ""doctor"" or ""conqueror"" or ""teacher"" or ""the big elephant"" or ""the number-one peasant"" or ""the wise old man"" or ""the national miracle"" or ""the most popular leader in the world."" His every pronouncement is reported on the front page. He sleeps with the wives and daughters of powerful men in the government. He shuffles ministers without warning, paralyzing policy decisions as he undercuts pretenders to his throne. He scapegoats minorities to shore up popular support. He bans all political parties except the one he controls. He rigs elections. He emasculates the courts. He cows the press. He stifles academia. He goes to church. Yet more than 150 leaders, many of them ""President for Life,"" have come and gone as the continent has been sucked downward in a spiral of declining per-capita food production and unpayable foreign debt, of civil war and rampant corruption. Africa was poorer at the end of the 1980s than it was when Big Men first usurped the authority of tribal chiefs and welded it to the power of the modern nation-state. At first blush, then, the reign of Daniel arap Moi in Kenya does not seem so destructive. After all, Kenya is an island of sanity in comparison to its East African neighbors, and Moi does not sanction the public mutilation of his enemies or write books about African utopia. Instead, he is a stolid, slow-speaking, not-very-bright Big Man who deftly uses the tools of his trade -- payoffs and coercion -- to stay in power. Yet it is precisely because of Kenya's success that Moi's rule has proved so pernicious. The logic of Moi's survival has been a recipe for national stagnation. His survival requires constant manipulation of the Big Man levers. His need to bleed the business community and grab all political power for himself is inversely proportional to his legitimacy. Since he comes from a tiny tribe, has little personal charisma, was never elected president and cannot reasonably expect to rule with the consent of the Kenyan majority, he needs larger and larger amounts of money to reward supporters, more and more power to silence enemies. According to the government's own press releases, Kenya must break its dependence on coffee, tea and tourism. There is no other palatable option. All the arable land is already planted. Game parks are severely overcrowded, and poaching has decimated elephant and rhino populations. But Kenya does have a competitive edge. It is well placed to become a manufacturing and service industry hub for East and Central Africa. It has the best port, the best roads, the best climate, the best work force, the best communications network, the best international reputation and the most vigorous free-market tradition in East Africa. To run with these advantages, the country desperately needs foreign and domestic investment. To compete internationally, the government has to reward efficiency rather than sycophancy. The law has to provide a level playing field for industry. These economic imperatives, which are the sine qua non of any country competing in the world marketplace, do not suit Moi's Big Man system. Wealth that Moi does not control is dissidence. Prosperity is far more destabilizing than stagnation. It should come as no surprise, then, that Kenya's economy -- outside of tourism, coffee and tea -- is dead in the water. Manufactured exports have declined in the 1980s and a parade of foreign manufacturers has pulled out. Almost no new ones have come in. Every year 150,000 young people flood into Kenya's job market. But industry generates only 3,000 new jobs a year. A diplomatic cable sent to Washington by the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi cited a pervasive pattern of ""favoritism as well as corruption in the Government of Kenya's treatment of the country's industries."" What grows is what Moi controls: government. In the first seven years of the 1980s, the number of government employees grew at an annual rate of 5.4 percent -- faster than the population, faster than the private sector, faster than the gross national product. It makes no economic sense. But it is perfectly consistent with Moi's need to buy loyalty. In the Moi years, an ethic of corruption has percolated deep into the civil service. In the mid-1980s, a friend of mine who works in the Finance Ministry told me with great pride that his mid-level civil servant colleagues were highly motivated and relatively honest. By the end of the decade, he despairingly said that ""every bureaucratic bottleneck is now presided over by somebody asking for money."" Kenya's descent into greed is by no means unique. Nor, by African standards, is it exceptionally venal. Yet Kenya is an African nation that has an opportunity not to unravel, and each day, as the population grows, as Moi's rot spreads, the window of opportunity closes. The future of 22 million Kenyans (in less than 20 years it will be 44 million) is being squandered to preserve one boring unelected president. The simplest cure for Big Man disease in Kenya, as across black Africa, would be Moi's replacement with a new, improved Big Man. If such a leader commanded personal authority he did not have to buy, if he were willing to operate within a framework of laws, if he exploited Kenya's potential for accelerated industrial growth, and if he was convinced of the need to resuscitate parliament and other decision-making bodies that allowed Kenyans to participate in their own governance, then the decline of Kenya could be turned around. On a trip to Ghana I asked military leader Jerry Rawlings -- who is a new and improved Big Man -- what is the best treatment for a slowly disintegrating country like Kenya. ""An enlightened dictator,"" he whispered. The dismal history of leadership in independent Africa, however, suggests that the odds are against Moi's successor being an enlightened despot, a philosopher king. Gibson Kamau Kuria, the gutsy Kenyan lawyer whom Moi jailed, vilified and this year forced into exile, told me again and again that Africans must learn not to place their future in the hands of a big chief, who may or may not turn out to be benevolent. Big Man disease, he said, can only be cured by vigorous institutions that limit individual power while increasing popular participation in government. To that end, Western governments and multilateral lending agencies may be able to play a supporting role in preserving or rebuilding Africa's democratic institutions. In that spirit, a top World Bank official recently urged the Kenyan government to do more to bring about democratic change. The power of the West to influence policy in poor African countries grew enormously in the 1980s. The poorer Africa became, the more it had to accept conditions on aid. Outsiders have become the architects of economic policy in much of black Africa. Kenya is particularly beholden to the West. The IMF demands devaluation of the Kenyan shilling and Kenya devalues. The choice is simple: reform or no loan money. For the time being, at least, Kenya has a legal tradition and democratic institutions. Both are wobbly, but they still exist. There are still large numbers of trained and committed people who believe in the rule of law and the usefulness of parliament. These individuals, however, are helpless in the face of Moi's one-man state, which is propped up by hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and tourist money. What they desperately need is for Western donors to insist on free elections in the same way that they insist on a rationally valued currency. The U.S. Congress acted properly when it voted recently to freeze $ 15 million in military aid, linking its resumption to political freedom. After an explosion of of international press criticism in 1987, Kenya's Big Man temporarily stopped his police from torturing people. He even stooped so low as to grant me -- a journalist whom he once described as ""serving foreign masters"" and using ""dirty words"" -- an interview. He did so for the sake of continued aid and to preserve an international reputation that keeps the tourists coming. Considering Moi's weak political base, his paranoia, and his boundless greed, my bet is that he also will stop stealing elections, bullying judges, and dismantling the constitution. That is, if he has no other way to get the money. Blaine Harden, Warsaw bureau chief for The Washington Post, previously was based in Nairobi.

C1 Novel Kept Undercover; Kenya Booksellers Afraid to Stock Le Carre  The new John le Carre novel, which is set in Kenya, cannot be purchased here. The country's leading booksellers refuse to stock it. Explaining why, the merchants behave as though they have been plunked into a le Carre creation themselves. They lower their voices and run their eyes nervously around their stores. The aisles harbor loiterers. ""I tell you what: I'm watched!"" hisses one proprietor, begging, like his fellow booksellers, not to be quoted by name. Sweat beads on his brow. He reports that his hand is quaking. ""Everyone's itching to get it in,"" he says of ""The Constant Gardener."" ""But . . ."" But in Kenya, reality turns out to be uncomfortably like the fiction in question. The central villain in ""The Constant Gardener,"" the 18th book by the British author widely acclaimed for elevating the spy novel to the level of literature, is a venal, greedy international pharmaceutical industry. But the greasy backdrop is Kenya. It is here that crusading aid workers are gruesomely murdered, and a lone British diplomat undertakes to unravel the multinational conspiracy at the heart of the matter. Along the way, le Carre sketches a rich portrait of contemporary Kenyan politics, complete with respectful references to the paleontologist turned politician Richard Leakey, who in the novel has lately been flagging in his IMF -backed effort to reform a government that a Brit diplomat on Page 53 blithely describes as ""terminally corrupt."" ""Falling apart from fraud, incompetence and neglect,"" the character goes on. It's the kind of observation a Nairobi resident often hears from ordinary Kenyans and in any of the local papers. What makes the words dangerous, apparently, is that they have been pressed between hard covers and offered for sale. ""It's risky talking about it,"" said the sweating bookseller. ""Very, very risky. I'm sorting my books out, actually. Lots of books go in the question-mark pile."" Books always have been taken more seriously than talk. President Daniel arap Moi, who has ruled Kenya for 23 years, demonstrated as much by cooperating with (some say paying) Andrew Morton on ""Moi: The Making of an African Statesman."" Morton, who also ghost-wrote Monica Lewinsky's autobiography, produced a hagiography as omnipresent in Nairobi shops as the presidential portraits that hang, by law, behind every counter. The availability of other titles varies with the whim of Kenya's ruling regime, or ""Moi's boys,"" in le Carre's phrase. "" 'Das Kapital' for a long time was a troublesome title here,"" said John Githongo, head of the local branch of Transparency International, the anti-corruption group. He recalled that in the 1980s, a district chairman of the ruling party publicly called for the arrest and deportation of Karl Marx for inflaming the passions of university students. (The author died in 1883.) More recently, Barbara Wood's ""Green City in the Sun,"" a hundred-year epic set in Kenya, became a touchy subject after a copy was confiscated at the Nairobi airport. Still, several booksellers said they would have stocked ""The Constant Gardener"" but for a stunning court ruling last August. A Nairobi judge fined two local bookshops a total of 10 million Kenya shillings (about $ 67,000) for selling ""Dr. Ian West's Casebook."" The nonfiction volume was co-written by the British pathologist who 10 years ago investigated the murder of Kenya's foreign minister. The book implicated another government minister, Nicholas Biwott, who in fact was briefly jailed on suspicion at the time. But last year Biwott, now Kenya's minister for trade and tourism, sued for libel. And even though ""Casebook"" was published in Britain, the Nairobi court held the booksellers responsible for its contents. ""It's a case of shooting the messenger,"" said one bookstore owner. ""In the wallet."" The ruling, though widely dubbed preposterous, had its chilling effect. When sales reps came to Nairobi peddling ""The Constant Gardener,"" they left with their order books empty. ""The Ian West book is a factual book, while this book of le Carre's is supposed to be fiction,"" observed one store owner. ""It's a fine line."" Le Carre acknowledged as much. His author's note at the close of ""The Constant Gardener"" acknowledges a long list of doctors and advocates who informed on the pharmaceutical industry he pillories. But ""with sadness"" he declines to name the Kenya residents who helped out. ""As I write, news is coming in of the death of John Kaiser, an American priest from Minnesota who worked in Kenya for the last 36 years,"" le Carre wrote. The body of the priest, a harsh critic of Kenya's ""human rights policies, or lack of them,"" was found with half his head blown off last August. ""Accidents like that can happen again,"" le Carre noted. The book merchants are not quite as dramatic. But with no law to support them -- Kenya has no statute referring to banning books or magazines -- they are left with a slippery political reality: ""Kenya has many 'unwritten laws,' "" said Emily Nyanjugu, of the Network for the Defense of Independent Media in Africa, an advocacy group based near Nairobi. ""It could've been fun if it was in a country where you could fight back,"" said one merchant. ""But it doesn't pay, not with these guys."" Never mind that requests for ""The Constant Gardener"" have numbered in the hundreds, several booksellers reported. Political intimidation trumps commerce every time. ""Let's put it this way,"" said another merchant. ""If the bookseller stops selling the book, it's the end of the story."""28-Nov-14,AFRICA (98%); SUDAN (93%); NIGERIA (92%); NAMIBIA (79%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%); SOMALIA (79%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%); EGYPT (79%); LIBYA (79%); KENYA (79%),"LONDON -- Question: How does the West see Africa? Answer: Through a prism, darkly. Africa is the Dark Continent, the Heart of Darkness. It is a somber story of disease and turmoil, corruption and despair, punctuated for decades by military takeovers, rigged ballots and wars that have done it few favors beyond securing the ambiguous gift of foreign aid. Dystopian musings surface easily -- and uncomfortably -- at a time when African states and regions seem to be associated exclusively with their problems: Ebola in West Africa, gun crime and corruption in South Africa. The leaders of Kenya and Sudan have been indicted by the International Criminal Court. The continent's newest nation, South Sudan, is mired in conflict. From Nigeria to Somalia, Islamic militants hold great swaths in their thrall. The events once labeled the Arab Spring have left a bequest of chaos in Libya and strongman rule in Egypt. In its latest report on the state of the continent's governance, the authoritative Mo Ibrahim Foundation, which carries the name of the Sudanese cellphone billionaire who founded it, concluded that, while overall ''performance has registered a slight improvement'' over the five years to 2013, the pace of that improvement has slowed and ''every African country has shown a decline'' in one area or another. In 2006, the foundation set up a $5 million prize to honor the leader showing the greatest commitment to democracy and good governance. Last year, for the fourth time in five years, the accolade went unawarded. But is that the whole story? Even the question -- How does the West see Africa? -- betrays part of the answer, for Africa is not a single entity to be seen through a single prism. Its broad patchwork covers many nations, from sparsely populated desert expanses of Namibia to the ferment of oil-rich Nigeria. There are some who see beyond the turmoil to a more subtle shift. ''Despite many setbacks,'' said Michael Holman, a British author with long experience of the continent, ''Africa is enjoying a cultural renaissance, recovering the self-confidence that had been shattered by successive traumas -- the slave trade, the colonial carve-up, the Cold War, the harsh medicine of the International Monetary Fund, all compounded by bad post-independence leadership.'' But, evoking a ''surge in African novels, the boom in African art, in style and fashion, in music,'' there was ''evidence of the 'new Africa,''' he said in an interview. ''With a rapidly growing middle class, a commodity-fueled economic recovery, boosted by the discovery of oil and gas the length and breadth of the continent, Africa is being transformed.'' If there is a political counterpoint to those perceived trends, it might well be discerned in a series of transitions currently underway that will indicate whether individual nations can overcome challenges, including the role of Islam, the power of the military and the Big Man culture nurtured by long-serving autocrats. In Tunisia, a runoff vote next month in the country's first democratic presidential elections has reopened deep divisions between secularists and Islamists. In Burkina Faso, a Western bulwark in the struggle against Islamic militants, the ouster of President Blaise Compaor led to an interim government in which the military asserted strong influence over a transition to elections by next November. In Zambia, the death in October of President Michael Sata opened a 90-day transition to elections in January that has strained the country's relative tranquility with factional strife. And in Zimbabwe next week, President Robert G. Mugabe, 90, is expected to use a gathering of his governing party to tighten his 34-year grip on power. Spread around the continent, those diverse states share a common demography: Africa's median age is less than 20, and, as Mr. Ibrahim said last year, its leadership ''must ask itself why our continent appears so frightened of giving the younger generation a chance.'' Perhaps another approach is to ask when that generation, like the youthful rioters who forced the departure of Mr. Compaor in Burkina Faso last month, will try to seize the chances for itself."6-May-15,KENYA (99%); AFRICA (91%); SOMALIA (79%),"Michael Meyer is dean of the graduate school of media and communications at Aga Khan University in Nairobi.  NAIROBI, Kenya -- Is Kenya losing its luster as the star of a rising Africa? The short answer is, no. But from afar it certainly looks that way. Consider a modest sampling of recent events: A member of Parliament is assassinated in the heart of downtown Nairobi. A few weeks later, a prominent businessman is shot 15 times in a gangland execution. Students at an aviation school here stage a raucous rally after media reports reveal that many won their certificates by allegedly bribing administrators. Think about that: Aspiring aviation technicians who will one day be working on complicated machines that fly through the air carrying large numbers of people are graduating in some cases without attending classes. Police officers fire tear gas at elementary and middle school students and teachers protesting wealthy land-grabbers conspiring to steal the kids' playing fields. Images of children running from the riot police amid clouds of tear gas flash around the world. In early April, the country was hit with its latest terrorist drama: the killing of 148 people at Garissa University near the Somali border by militant Islamists. Why did it take Kenya's elite special police force seven hours to get to the scene, Kenyans asked. They got a sickening answer. A senior official ordered the unit's plane to ferry his daughter-in-law and two children back to Nairobi from the coastal resort town of Mombasa, even as the crisis unfolded. More recently, the international Committee to Protect Journalists reported on two Kenyan journalists beaten by paramilitary police officers using clubs and iron bars. According to the CPJ, this was but the latest in a series of attacks on journalists reporting allegations of police corruption. At times, Kenya seems its own worst enemy. When it comes to issues that the rest of the world pays most attention to, the country has an unerring knack for shooting itself in the foot. In 2013, the government proposed new security legislation imposing onerous penalties on news organizations deemed by a government-controlled panel to be unreliable in their reporting. Another law proposed to ban NGOs from receiving more than 15 percent of their funding from foreign sources; in December, the government deregistered more than 500, allegedly for failing to file financial returns. International news agencies and global human rights organizations had a field day. Democracy under threat! they trumpeted. Crackdown on the media! This year brought a similar flap. In an effort to accelerate Kenya's transition to digital broadcasting, the government interfered with the operations of three television networks, allegedly for moving too slowly. After police officials forcibly closed their transmission station, the networks shut down their own digital signals in protest and plunged the country into a three-week news and entertainment blackout. Adding insult to injury, the regulators had awarded licenses to a pair of competitors, one owned by the government and the other a Chinese company, along with rights to rebroadcast local and international content regardless of copyright. Kenya's political opposition shifted into high gear. Rival political leaders accused the government of seeking to crush free speech and tame the country's robustly independent media. Absurdly, one went so far as to charge President Uhuru Kenyatta with leading the nation into ''dictatorship.'' Not surprisingly, the world's media lasered in on the controversy. On these global litmus tests for democracy and civil society, Kenya was seen to be failing. The real story, of course, is more complicated. For all the sturm und drang, the controversies that drew so much critical international scrutiny have largely fallen away. The proposed laws restricting the media are under review by the Supreme Court and likely to be quietly renegotiated. The most onerous NGO restrictions were dropped when the bill became law, and few have had to curtail their activities. In the fight over digital migration, a deal has been made. The country's three major networks are back on the air, licenses restored. And to be fair, the government was not wholly in the wrong. For years, Kenya's major broadcasters had been resisting a move that other nations made long ago, missing deadline after deadline. The licenses granted to those companies had earlier been offered to the major media houses and turned down. To those in the know, their very successful effort to cast themselves as victims of rapacious regulators smacked of self-serving spin. Meanwhile, there has been bona fide good news. Economic growth for 2015 has been projected at 6.9 percent by the International Monetary Fund and 6 percent by the World Bank, higher than past forecasts. Foreign investment continues to pour into the country. Apart from insecurity, according to the I.M.F. and World Bank, the chief impediment to a brighter future is corruption, poor governance and debt. Coincidentally or not, the Kenyan government appears to be listening. In recent months, it has launched a sweeping anticorruption drive. A dozen former and current cabinet ministers and regional governors are under investigation for graft; formal indictments and more prosecutions are said to be on the way. Kenya's media outlets are launching investigations of their own and devoting major coverage to the crackdown -- oddly, however, without giving much credit to the government for initiating the campaign. Enter the spin-meisters. Mindful of the importance of global perceptions, Kenya's government is undertaking a public relations blitz to refurbish its image. In February, it hired the Podesta Group, whose chairman, Tony Podesta, is a lobbyist with extensive ties with Democratic leaders. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain has been brought in to attract foreign backing for a series of high-profile infrastructure and technology projects. A prominent global public relations firm most recently joined the effort to resuscitate Kenya's tourist industry. Whether these big names will do more than collect big fees is an open question. More to the point is whether Mr. Kenyatta can deliver on his anticorruption drive and stop his ministers from egregiously thieving from the public till. When it comes to Kenya's image in the world, he must find a way to keep them from shooting themselves in the foot, particularly on issues that attract so much international attention. If he succeeds, Kenya will prosper, regardless of its terrorists. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

It was 7 A.M. He is still an early riser. ""I'm going to kick off, if I may,"" said one reporter. ""As long as you don't kick me,"" warned Mr. Mandela. His tone was only half-joking. Mr. Mandela was clearly ready to cross swords. At 78, he is recovering from a knee operation and walks with difficulty. His hands and ankles look swollen. Photographers cannot use a flash because it bothers his eyes, which were injured by dust during years of breaking rocks in prison. But Mr. Mandela is as regal as anyone who rose from Xhosa prince to political prisoner to state president can be -- and if he is a bit irritable, he perhaps has reason to be. It's not the aches and pains of age that bother him, but the nagging criticism of his young Government that he hears constantly at home and that filters overseas, discouraging investors and tourists. The euphoria of the peaceful transition from white supremacist government has worn off, and South Africans are beginning to carp, like citizens of any other democracy. Whites, fearful of crime and affirmative action, are continuing to flee the country. Blacks, disappointed that few new jobs have appeared and that squatter camps still spread for miles, are showing some signs of disenchantment with Mr. Mandela's African National Congress party. A recent poll showed that its support had dropped to 53 percent in July from 66 percent in 1994. Everyone worries about the fall of the rand, charges of petty corruption, squabbling among African National Congress officials and whether the new Government has enough competent civil servants. Mr. Mandela finds these complaints unfair. In an hourlong interview on Friday, he talked of success ""beyond our wildest expectations"" in creating a South Africa based on democratic principles and an array of checks and balances. Last year, he said, even he was overruled on a voter registration issue by the country's Constitutional Court. ""What can be more democratic than that?"" he asked. On occasion, his temper flared. Responding to a question citing black critics who weren't even in the room, he vehemently defended the contributions of whites, construing the critics narrowly to be senior black editors, whose ""ignorance"" he attacked. Reaching for a folder full of statistics, Mr. Mandela -- a man revered as a saint and feted all over the world as a statesman -- for once sounded less like Gandhi and more like an American Congressman boasting of what he has done for his district. He told of the bacon his administration had brought home, beginning with the respectable 3.5 percent economic growth rate achieved last year. ""As far as water is concerned,"" he continued, ""700 water supply projects are under way, which will give 6.4 million people access to water. Already 600,000 people have been supplied with water. This is in rural areas where people have never had clean tap water. ""On health, we say, over 5.5 million schoolchildren in poor areas are benefiting from the primary school nutrition program. Four hundred new health clinics have been completed since after 1994. ""Then we deal with housing and we say by the end of the year, 500,000 subsidies will have been released. At the moment 170,000 houses are in production. ""And electrification: in the last four months alone, 400,000 homes have been hooked up."" Lacking in the statistics are facts that might shade these victories. There is no mention that the school feeding program has been marred by corruption or that the housing starts fall far short of the promises made in the administration's heady early days. But Mr. Mandela did acknowledge some problems, most notably the country's continuing difficulty remaking its police force. Under apartheid, the force was largely used to protect whites, contain riots and spy on political activists, or torture and murder them. Now it is being asked to protect and serve the populace -- but it has little experience in fighting crime and precious little understanding of individual rights. It is also bedeviled by corrupt officers. ""There are rogue elements, some of them in key positions,"" Mr. Mandela said, ""and while they are a tiny minority, they are doing a great deal of harm."" But he had statistics on this subject as well. He pointed out that in the province of KwaZulu/Natal, no fewer than 278 police officers had been arrested on such charges as corruption, murder, robbery and thievery since 1994. In the province of Gauteng, which includes Johannesburg, he said that the state was investigating 8,300 cases against police officers and that 434 officers had been arrested. ""We have done that in almost all the provinces,"" Mr. Mandela said. ""We are getting on top of that."" His administration has tangled openly with the country's news organizations, attributing negative perceptions to bad local journalism. Asked about criticism that he spends too much time worrying about the concerns of whites, Mr. Mandela erupted. Such remarks, he said, come from ""superficial"" senior black journalists who do not appreciate that white skills and money are part of the country's strength. ""They assume,"" he said, ""that we have defeated whites on a battlefield and that the whites are now lying on the floor helpless and begging for mercy and that we can impose conditions on them."" That is hardly true, he continued, and it is best to keep whites from joining the right. In addition, he said, large white-controlled companies are helping the country's transformation, sometimes building schools and health clinics simply because he asks them to. His priorities for the coming year include stabilizing the rand, and he said he might be willing, for the first time, to borrow from the International Monetary Fund to do that. But he said he hoped that money raised by selling state assets like radio stations and part of the telephone company would obviate the need for that. Asked about possible roles for the nation's strong and disciplined army in policing African conflicts, he expressed reluctance to get involved, because of South Africa's history of destabilizing its neighbors. He said he might let troops join a mission organized by the United Nations or the Organization of African Unity.  But he took a dim view of anyone who expected him to solve the continent's problems. ""If I have any moral authority -- and I say 'if' -- moral authority doesn't solve world problems."" As he learned after criticizing President Sani Abacha of Nigeria, moral authority doesn't change policies. ""They're changed by those countries who trade with the country, such as the United States, which imports 52 percent of Nigeria's oil."" Mr. Mandela deflected several questions during the interview, including one about the certainty that Deputy President Thabo Mbeki will succeed him and one about whether he believed former President F. W. de Klerk had directly ordered atrocities against blacks. ""I'd like to avoid that if you don't mind,"" Mr. Mandela said, leaving little room for appeal. He denied recent speculation that he would step down before the end of 1999, saying only that he would cede his post as party president next year to open the field to younger people, ""who are really more energetic, more assertive and who are deep thinkers with better vision."" It has been widely acknowledged by African National Congress officials that Mr. Mbeki, 54, will be elected to the post. ""In any case,"" Mr. Mandela said with a grin, ""a leader who doesn't know when to step down will really come to grief, because he may be humiliated. I must step down whilst there are one or two people who admire me."""28-Dec-89,SOUTH AFRICA (97%);,"When South Africa created its black homelands and pushed four of them into nominal independence, it did not anticipate that they would hatch a maverick like Maj. Gen. Bantu Holomisa. General Holomisa took power in Transkei in a bloodless coup in December 1988 with a pledge to root out the corruption that became endemic under its previous leader, George Matanzima. Now the military ruler looks like a loose cannon on the deck of apartheid's ship of state. Within the last two months, the 34-year-old chief of the 4,000-member Transkei Defense Force has shattered the collaborationist image that caused Bantustan leaders to be held in disdain at home and overseas. And Pretoria can do little to muffle him without undercutting its position that Transkei is a sovereign nation. Transkei's radio station was the only one in South Africa to broadcast the mass rally near Soweto on Oct. 29 that welcomed home seven political prisoners prominent in the outlawed African National Congress. On Nov. 5, General Holomisa gave his approval to a politically charged funeral at home for the reburial of Sabata Dalindyebo, a tribal chief loyal to the Congress who died in exile after being deposed by the Matanzima regime. National Congress Rally On Nov. 26, General Holomisa authorized and himself attended Transkei's own rally on behalf of the African National Congress, at which Walter Sisulu and other released leaders spoke to a crowd of more than 70,000. The general suggested that the congress might some day open an office in Transkei. He has freed local political prisoners and lifted restrictions on some groups supporting the African National Congress. And there is an unconfirmed report that he secretly met its leader, Oliver Tambo, abroad. The country's 10 ethnic homelands were spawned by the Nationalist Government as a means to reduce the number of blacks living in South Africa on grounds that they belonged in their own tribal areas. Four such homelands -Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei - were declared independent, a status recognized only by South Africa and one another. The homelands depend almost totally on South Africa, providing migrant labor for its mines, factories and farms and collecting more than $2 billion a year in subsidies from Pretoria. General Holomisa suggested that Transkei's inhabitants might want to rejoin South Africa and, without consulting Pretoria, has invited political, civic and social groups to send representatives here on Feb. 7 to decide whether to hold a popular referendum on the issue. Responding to Changes In an interview, General Holomisa said he was only responding to the changes that President F. W. de Klerk, whom he will meet next month, had introduced in South Africa. ''The precedent was created in the very country that produced apartheid,'' the general said in an interview in his office in Umtata, Transkei's capital. But General Holomisa made clear that he was positioning his homeland to take advantage of a shift in the political wind by opening a dialogue with all parties, not least the African National Congress. ''If South Africa is changing course, I think it is for everybody to exploit and promote the situation,'' General Holomisa said. Phathekile Holomisa, an Umtata lawyer, said his brother's actions were consistent with the tradition of the Xhosas, the largest black ethnic group in South Africa after the Zulus. ''Chiefs generally listened to the people,'' said Mr. Holomisa, who inherited a Xhosa chieftainship. ''They were never dictators.'' He is regarded as closer to the African National Congress than the general and visited its headquarters in Lusaka last August with a delegation of traditional leaders from South Africa. First Independent Homeland ''I feel that most people are against the independence of the Transkei and regard themselves as part and parcel of South Africa,'' he said. Transkei, an area the size of Denmark bordering the Indian Ocean, was the first homeland to be made independent on Oct. 26, 1976. Last year, Pretoria gave Transkei about $350 million, or more than 40 percent of its annual budget. General Holomisa said 600,000 migrants out of a Transkei population of more than three million worked in South Africa. One reason why many blacks do not like to live in the homelands is that the standard of living and social services in the homelands remains much lower than in the rest of South Africa. ''We still have overcrowded hospitals,'' General Holomisa said. ''We still don't have enough to build schools.'' He complained that black neighbors like Mozambique and Lesotho, where the African National Congress was legal, were receiving economic help from South Africa, which wants to improve its standing on the continent. Pretoria's charity, he said, should begin in the homelands. 'A Sort of Raw Deal' ''They still pump billions of rands into neighboring countries which have not banned these organizations,'' General Holomisa said. ''We would like to operate like they are doing.'' Because Transkei was perceived abroad as a puppet state, he said, it suffered from the Western economic sanctions imposed on South Africa and could not get loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, while other African countries were eligible. ''We are being punished by this tag 'independent,' so we have been given a sort of raw deal,'' General Holomisa said. The Transkei leader recently legalized local branches of some anti-apartheid organizations restricted by the South African Government, including the United Democratic Front, the Azanian People's Organization and the Congress of South African Students. ''If South Africa is shifting the goal posts because it's no longer talking the Verwoerdian language,'' said General Holomisa, alluding to the late Prime Minister, Hendrick Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid, ''we'll shift our goalposts so we don't aim at the wrong target.'' A Non-Aggression Pact General Holomisa has yet to lift Transkei's own bans on the African National Congress or the Pan-Africanist Congress, a rival black liberation movement, though he suggested that he would do so eventually. And he said nationalist guerrillas could never operate out of Transkei, as they have from Zambia or Angola, because of a non-aggression pact imposed by South Africa. ''One of the reasons we couldn't unban the A.N.C. or the P.A.C. is we were afraid it might be hijacked and fall into the wrong hands,'' he said, referring to those who might undermine his regime. ''In Transkei, we need to identify who is who, otherwise it will get out of hand.'' The initial reaction in the Transkei to the idea of rejoining South Africa has been 70 percent favorable, the general said, though he would leave the decision on a referendum to the conference in February. ''Otherwise, they will accuse us of taking them at gunpoint,'' General Holomisa said, joking about his military rule. Mr. Holomisa, the general's brother, said he knew the South African Government was not happy with what was happening in Transkei, By contrast, Andrew Mlangeni, one of the political prisoners recently released by Mr. de Klerk, hailed General Holomisa at last month's rally as ''the spiritual brother'' of the congress's guerrilla wing Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation. General Holomisa seemed uncomfortable with the compliment when asked about it, but his tacit encouragement of the anti-apartheid movement seems to have increased his domestic popularity, already high because of his reputation for honesty and plain living. ''It gives people a feeling of not being excluded as part of a homeland, but being included as part of the struggle in the country,'' said Dr. Zola Dabula, a physician in Umtata who helped organize the rally for the African National Congress. ''Everybody wants to be seen to be allied with progressive structures.'' Seeks Supporting Role General Holomisa said the South African Government, the African National Congress and the Pan-Africanist Congress would still play the primary roles in determining the country's future. But Transkei and the other homelands, he said, should prepare for a supporting role. He has invited other homeland leaders to a meeting in Umtata on Jan. 22 and 23. ''Not everyone goes to the battle,'' General Holomisa said, citing a Xhosa proverb. ''There will always be old people and children to look after homes and cattle. When the warriors come back, they don't shun those people.''"8-Jun-92,SUDAN (96%);,"With a copy of the Koran in one hand and the economic theories of Milton Friedman in the other, the Sudanese Government is trying to wed unbridled capitalism to militant Islam. ""An Islamic society should reconcile material and spiritual progress,"" Finance Minister Abdel Rahim Hamdi said, ""which is something that is decidedly lacking in Western civilization now."" The Government, a fierce critic of Western mores and culture, has instituted a series of bold economic measures, including the floating of the currency and a lifting of subsidies on basic commodities. The measures have hit the populace like a hammer blow. The Sudanese, with average incomes of about $18 a month, are struggling to buy gasoline and food under the onslaught of a 120 percent inflation rate.  Rumbles of discontent, audible even in a state that has developed a pervasive internal security network, make the reforms the riskiest political venture of the three-year-old Government. 'No One Has Money' ""We have food to sell, which is an improvement,"" Youssef al-Agib, a vegetable vendor, said in his stall in the central market in Omdurman. ""But no one has money to buy very much."" The Sudanese economy, heavily dependent on agriculture, was devastated by a succession of 30 governments in the last 35 years that rarely invested in transportation systems or other infrastructure and often diverted state funds to private bank accounts, according to Western diplomats. By the time the Islamic fundamentalists took power in a military coup in 1989, the railroads, which two decades before had carried 3 million tons a year, were able to carry only 300,000 tons. Irrigation canals, which were never dredged, did not channel water to the fields. Power blackouts lasted hours. But the military Government of Lieut. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir, whose de facto leader is Hassan al-Turabi of the National Islamic Front, cracked down on corruption, and despite meager resources, invested heavily in building up the infrastructure. By the end of this year, the state railroad is expected to carry one million tons. The Government, which has seen the nation bring in its best harvest since 1970, estimates that it has recovered half a million acres of farmland. Even the Government's fiercest critics admit that the pilfering of state funds has been curtailed. By April, the Government had instituted reforms that in some cases went beyond recommendations of the International Monetary Fund, ending subsidies on everything from bread to gasoline. The price of gasoline jumped from 41 cents a gallon to $1.14. The price of flour rocketed by 500 percent, forcing many people to switch to sorghum. ""The amazing thing is that the Government seems to have managed to make the Sudanese, who are really suffering now, accept all this,"" a senior relief official said. ""In the days before this regime, people would have rioted and taken to the streets."" Many Sudanese, and particularly those in need, will glean little from the reforms. The three-month Government ban on aid shipments to the largely Christian and animist south, where the long-running civil war continues, has meant that most humanitarian operations have suspended operations, and stockpiles of food sit in Khartoum and Kenya undelivered. The United Nations estimates that 7.6 million people in the Sudan -- about a quarter of the population -- will suffer from drought and famine this year and that 7.2 million will need emergency food aid at a cost of $471 million. And despite the reforms, the Government is still unable to make payments on most of its debt, including the $2 billion owed to the I.M.F. The inability to service the debt has cut the country off from further loans. The second phase of the reforms will take place in a few months, when the Government begins to sell off vast public holdings, including huge cooperative farms, the railroads and a host of unproductive state industries."17-Feb-82,SUDAN (99%); UNITED STATES (92%); AFRICA (92%); EASTERN AFRICA (92%);,"The dervishes dance here on Fridays. The dance is a deep-rooted tradition, performed by those who see themselves as close to Allah, for Islam is a powerful force in the Sudan, America's most prominent ally in East Africa. In recent weeks Islam has added its voice to a clamor for change that has been directed against the nation's embattled leader, Gen.  Gaafar al-Nimeiry, and that has brought the army, students and other groups into confrontation with him. Recently, the Islamic priests of Omdurman approved a prohibition on alcohol in the city, but President Nimeiry overruled them. The result, according to a high Moslem official, was a series of tirades directed by the priests against the President from the mosques during Friday prayers. More significantly, General Nimeiry met with the nation's most prominent figures in January to defend a series of economic austerity measures that provoked student riots that month. At the meeting, a participant said, those who attacked the President included Dr. Hassan al-Turabi, the Sudan's Attorney General and leader of the Moslem Brotherhood, a powerful urban Islamic group. Unrestrained in Their Attacks Dr. Turabi spoke against the concentration of power in the President's hands, according to the participant. The Islamic leader also criticized the Sudanese Socialist Union, the nation's only legal political party, and the entire ''political order,'' saying it did not reflect the popular will. General Nimeiry, who led a group of officers and civilians that seized power in 1969 and who has been President since 1971, attended the tempestuous meeting only at its opening and closing sessions, but followed speeches on closed-circuit television from an office nearby. The speakers were aware of this but were unrestrained in their attacks, the participant said, and one critic was forced into silence by his friends because his speech was so virulently anti-Nimeiry.  Army generals at the gathering complained of corruption in the upper echelons of the Government and about the President's increasingly autocratic style. President Nimeiry, the participant said, responded with harsh words, angrily accusing the army of cowardice.  The Sudan's generals have traditionally regarded themselves as a weighty political force, unused to such high-handed treatment. After the January meeting they demanded a separate encounter with the President. ''They were angry because he called them cowards,'' a Government source said. ''They spoke against the party, against corruption.  They said corruption had reached the presidential palace. They told Nimeiry he was becoming a dictator.'' General Nimeiry's response to the military's complaints was swift.  In January he dismissed 22 senior army officers. He also dismissed Vice President Abdel Majid Khalil, whom some dissidents had seen as a potential rallying point for opposition. The army purge fitted a pattern of harsh reaction. In December, President Nimeiry jailed 21 politicians from the southern Sudan who had banded together to try to thwart the general's plan to divide their area into subregions. When University of Khartoum students and high school pupils rioted to protest a 60 percent increase in the price of sugar, General Nimeiry sent the police and army to oppose them and then closed down all schools. After January's criticism he dissolved the leadership of the Sudanese Socialist Union and formed a committee that is supposed to remodel the party. Increasingly, his critics assert, General Nimeiry has acted without reference to the Constitution or the law to impose his will across the nation, Africa's biggest and one of the world's poorest. The resultant opposition seems widespread among the Sudanese.  A senior Government official, for instance, recently listed the possible destinies awaiting his country. The official spoke of a possible leftist coup, or a general breakdown in law and order, or a military takeover, or a popular uprising. Last on his list of possibilities was the likelihood of changes inside the highly centralized Government. It is a token of President Nimeiry's personalized style that he is not only head of the country but also head of the Sudanese Socialist Union, Supreme Commander of the armed forces, Commander in Chief of the armed forces, Minister of Defense, Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture and Irrigation. An increase in the price of sugar was part of a package of measures introduced at the urging of the International Monetary Fund as part of a design to salvage the Sudan's shaky economy. In the January riots, witnesses said, demonstrators linked the United States with those outside forces that are forcing economic change and hardship on the Sudan's 18 million people. The rioters stoned the American Cultural Center in Khartoum and chanted slogans against American imperialism outside the United States Embassy. In addition, some southern politicians have recently spoken out against General Nimeiry's close identification with Washington, which they see as an infringement of the Sudan's proclaimed nonalignment. The General's unpopularity has profound implications for the Reagan Administration, which is President Nimeiry's most prominent supporter and which views the Sudan as a strategic, pro-Western bulwark protecting Egypt's southern flank and, by extension, the Camp David process. $100 Million in U.S. Arms Aid Washington has a high profile in the Sudan. Stepped-up American military aid worth about $100 million has begun to arrive, and United States economic aid this year will total $180 million, Washington's biggest aid package in Africa apart from its support for Egypt. Each time the American Ambassador, William Kontos, meets President Nimeiry, the encounter is given prominence in the state-controlled press and broadcasting, reinforcing the association between Washington and the general's unpopular measures, Western diplomats said. A critical factor in the presidential survival stakes, which seems to be the talk of the city, is the absence of an obvious alternative, a familiar syndrome in Africa. A senior Sudanese analyst, for example, acknowledged the President's eroded popular support but said, ''If there is no leadership for a revolt, it will stop at verbal assaults.'' As this argument goes, there was a moment in January when Vice President Khalil could have overthrown General Nimeiry but chose not to. This, Western diplomats said, allowed the President to ''reassert his authority and start building political structures to support him.''"21-Jul-85,SUDAN (99%); UNITED STATES (95%); LIBYAN ARAB JAMAHIRIYA (93%); AFRICA (92%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (92%); ETHIOPIA (79%);   LIBYA (93%);,"This time of year, a violent wind known as the habub often blows in from the desert, cloaking Khartoum in a nearly impenetrable fog of dust and sand. The political climate has been even more murky since a coup in April brought a military group to power. ''There's great uncertainty about which way things are heading,'' said Peter Woodward, a British scholar specializing in the Sudan. ''But this is also the most crucial moment in the 30 years since independence.'' Three months ago, tens of thousands of Sudanese stopped work and gathered in the streets to shout for the downfall of President Gaafar al-Nimeiry, who had ruled for 16 years with strong American support. Mr. Nimeiry was visiting Washington when the protests broke out. On his way back, a military group under Gen. Abdel Rahman Siwar el-Dahab announced that it had taken charge and that Mr. Nimeiry would not be welcomed home. General Siwar el-Dahab and his officers organized themselves as the Transitional Military Council and pledged to return to the barracks in a year, after free and fair elections. In the weeks since then, up to 40 political parties and factions, from Moslem fundamentalist to Communist, have emerged to express their anger, aims and ambitions. At first, this new freedom to let off steam had a cathartic effect. Frustration soon began to build, however, as it became clear that the military was unwilling to provoke one faction by meeting the demands of another. ''People are disappointed that there have not been more changes,'' said Dr. Atima Babiker Mahmoud, a Khartoum University political scientist and leader on the left. ''We have so many problems that need to be addressed.'' The most urgent one, of course, is famine. According to United Nations estimates, it could endanger half this country's 22 million people before the year is out. Huge stores of grain and other emergency supplies have been shipped in, mostly from the United States, but mismanagement, corruption, indifference and natural calamity have hobbled efforts to get the food to most of those urgently in need. The exceptionally heavy rains that have been falling over the last few weeks in the western region of Darfour, the area hardest hit by famine, have washed out railway and road bridges and turned dirt tracks to mire, further delaying the movement of food. Amid the gloom, an encouraging note came late in the week with a United Nations announcement that the rail link to the west had been restored. Drought is one cause of the Sudan's famine. Long-term economic deterioration is another. In recent years, the Sudan has become ''the most indebted country in the world relative to its size,'' said an economist here. Last week, bank employees went on strike and demonstrated in the streets demanding, among other things, that the Government reject such painful measures as a devaluation and an end to costly subsidies prescribed by the International Monetary Fund and other organizations. U.S. Is Upset Government spokesmen insist they need more help from abroad but it is not easy to see where that help would come from. The Sudan is already the largest recipient of American aid in sub-Saharan Africa. This special relationship is now in jeopardy as a result of the surprise announcement by Defense Minister Osman Abdallah Mohamed the week before last that he had signed a military cooperation agreement with Libya. The State Department expressed ''grave concern'' and said that the accord ''could only impact adversely on United States-Sudanese ties.'' General Siwar al-Dahab professed not to understand why the Sudan's ''closer relationship'' with Libya should upset the United States. According to a foreign affairs specialist from a Middle Eastern country, the Sudanese did not sign this agreement because they like or trust the Libyans. ''They did it,'' he said, ''because they are scared of the Libyans and want to placate them.'' The still unpublished Libyan-Sudanese agreement may be even more damaging to the Sudan's alliance with Egypt, which has long been on the outs with Libya. General Siwar al-Dahab took advantage of a meeting of the Organization of African Unity in Addis Ababa last week to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The general also met with the Ethiopian leader, Col. Mengistu Haile-Mariam. Ethiopia's Marxist Government has been supporting a powerful rebel movement in the southern Sudan. The rebel leadership has so far refused to negotiate with Khartoum and many believe Colonel Mengistu is one reason why. The colonel appears unlikely to smooth the way toward a reconciliation in the Sudan unless Khartoum helps Ethiopia in its civil war against rebels in the drought-stricken northern regions of Eritrea and Tigre, which get relief supplies through the Sudan. But if the Sudan halted shipments to the rebel regions, it could alienate donor nations and agencies at the time of greatest need. ''Whichever way this Government steps, they hit a land mine,'' said a European diplomat.''That's why they're so reluctant to move, and that's why the situation is as fragile as it is.''"10-Sep-90,"TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (94%); AFRICA (92%); KENYA (79%); COTE D'IVOIRE (79%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%);","To many people in this sleepy Indian Ocean port city, 57-year-old James Mapalala is something of an eccentric. True, it seems a bit strange that Mapalala and his wife, Hannah, live on a small patch of dirt near the middle of downtown with six noisy ducks, five chickens, three cows and a couple of scruffy dogs. True, the lanky, white-haired fellow tends to write so many notes to himself that his baggy pants pockets often overflow with crumpled wads of paper. But in a lethargic land where strict rule by one political party is constitutionally mandated and where public dissent is rare and sometimes stiffly penalized, this gentle man is most noted for speaking his mind. Often. He is among Tanzania's most eloquent advocates of civil and human rights and political change. ""I'm sure almost everyone in Dar es Salaam knows Mapalala and what he stands for,"" said C. Stanley Kamana, editor of a weekly newspaper here. ""I know the government people don't think too much of him. But everyone respects his beliefs. He has made the idea of dissent an honorable thing."" At a time when popular movements for democratic change have flared across sub-Saharan Africa, from Kenya to the Ivory Coast, the ideas of free thinking and freedom of expression have gradually acquired new value and respect. For many Africans, cowed by years of state repression, the assertion of liberties and individual rights remains a new and frightening thing, however. Not to Mapalala. He is a grand master in the art of daring to differ. The other day, Mapalala grabbed a microphone at a private hearing called by ruling party officials to discuss press freedom in Tanzania. In a booming voice, he declared the hearing a farce, saying there is no such thing as guaranteed freedom of expression in Tanzania and never will be until the government allows fair elections. The journalists in attendance applauded loudly. Party officials kept their lips tight. Back in the 1950s, Mapalala, a building contractor by trade, was a founding member of the Tanganyika African National Union, precursor of the Party of the Revolution, which rules to this day. He was, he said, once a close friend and ally of some the highest-ranking members of the government. He said he still believes deeply in African liberation struggles and the principle of socialist self-reliance that guided former president Julius K. Nyerere, whom he admires. But over time, Mapalala said, he grew to detest what he saw as growing official corruption and political repression -- including press censorship and jailing of dissidents -- carried out in the name of principle. ""Unity and socialism were just an umbrella many of these [officials] sat under to hide the fact that they used their positions for personal gain,"" he scoffed, sitting back in a chair on his humble inner-city spread. ""It's all lies. There is no democracy here. There is no freedom. And they can arrest you for even thinking that way, isn't that right, Hannah?"" he asked. His wife, feeding the ducks, sighed and nodded her head. It was Hannah Mapalala whom her husband credits with saving his life. In 1986, he was detained without charge or trial, suspected of attempting to overthrow the government. His crime was circulating a petition calling for abolition of the single-party law; in just a few weeks, 320,000 people had signed. This did not go over well with the ruling party, which faced serious problems. The economy had fallen apart and the country was about to be ousted from the International Monetary Fund. The government began arresting scores of ""economic saboteurs,"" including merchants, dissidents and human rights activists. Hannah Mapalala, who recalled the terror she felt upon seeing the police drag her husband away, didn't know what a habeas or a corpus was, much less a writ. But, she said, she educated herself quickly in the ways of the law, went to court and filed papers to gain Mapalala's release. She pressed the press and party officials. Finally, she turned to Amnesty International, and the human rights group began to publicize the case. It was a tense, embarrassing time for a government founded on principles of ""caring"" and ""fairness"" that had always prided itself on its ability to maintain national peace and unity. Mapalala was put in Dar es Salaam's central jail with hundreds of young felons, he said. He said he was regularly beaten. After 1 1/2 years, he became sick with dysentery and began to lose his sight, when state health officials found him unconscious with fever. Soon after, Mapalala was banished to Mafia (Swahili for ""nice breeze"") Island in the Indian Ocean, about 25 miles off the coast. The island is sparsely populated, but tourist brochures call it a great place to fish. Mapalala, exiled there for more than a year, said he didn't see any tourists, didn't catch many fish and spent most of his time tilling a barren patch of soil, trying to grow something to eat. ""It was so lonely, it would have been easy to go a little crazy there,"" he said. ""I just put my faith in Hannah."" In April 1989, the government ""pardoned"" Mapalala, even though he had never been charged with a crime. Hannah recalls her shock at feeling how skinny he had become when they embraced in Dar es Salaam a few days later. After his long ordeal, the government probably expected the old man to pipe down. But not Mapalala. It took him about an hour, he said, to begin his crusade once more. As the government froze his bank account and seized all his assets except the downtown patch of dirt he lives on, Mapalala drew up another multi-party petition -- he says it has more than 100,000 signatures so far -- and founded a legal defense organization he calls the Civil and Human Rights Movement of Tanzania. Mapalala says it is an association; ruling party officials call it an illegal political group. But Mapalala persists. Recently, he took up the case of a young Tanzanian studying in China who died under mysterious circumstances earlier this year while in police custody in Beijing. The student's family, recognizing Mapalala as a champion of difficult causes, sought his advice. He promptly took the story to the local press and pressed authorities to open an inquest, prompting, he said, a brief visit to his home by several unhappy Chinese Embassy officials. ""I suppose I am a bit different. Even some of my relatives don't care to have much to do with me anymore,"" said Mapalala, placing his arm around Hannah's neck as she rested her head on his shoulder. ""People brand me a buffoon, power hungry, a crazy old man. . . . I just do what I think is right."""16-Apr-00,UGANDA (94%); UNITED STATES (79%);,"Plans by Uganda to acquire a new Gulfstream jet for its president have led international lenders to put off a decision on new debt relief for that country. The delay is an embarrassing new complication for a global debt-relief program that Congress is skeptical about funding. Uganda, an early participant in the program, has won praise for using the savings from canceled debt payments to improve primary education. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank had hoped to announce approval of an expanded package for Uganda at a meeting of their governing committees this week here. But last week officials delayed implementing the plan, some of them appalled at the idea of forgiving more loans just when a luxury jet was ordered. Sources said the reported cost of the plane, about $ 35 million, is about what Uganda would save annually in debt-service payments under an expanded aid plan that now has been delayed. Thousands of demonstrators were expected to turn out today to protest the World Bank and IMF, which they say finance a world order based on exploitation. The institutions have cited the debt-relief program as proof that they care about countries left behind by the global economy and are taking tough decisions to help them. The program grows from a decision last year by industrial nations to forgive $ 28 billion in debt owed to the World Bank and other ""multilateral"" lenders. More than 30 countries could potentially qualify. The core requirement is that money saved on debt payments must go to schools, public health programs and other desperately needed services. Participating countries must work out detailed plans with lenders--the idea is to assure that corruption and local political priorities that often led to the squandering of the original loans don't lead to the misuse of money saved on debt service. With Congress delaying a White House request for funding of the U.S. share of the global program, proponents were worried that the delay would give new ammunition to the program's critics. Some were urging Uganda to reverse itself. ""We don't think that the plane is pro-poor . . . and we think the government of Uganda should reconsider its priorities as soon as possible,"" said Seth Amgott, a spokesman for Oxfam International, a relief agency that has promoted the debt-relief program. An IMF director representing Uganda in the organization said he believed the delay would be short. Questions were posed about the jet, but not ""in a challenging way,"" Cyrus Rustomjee said. ""We don't recognize this as being any extraordinary expenditure."" The plane's purchase had been discussed in Uganda's parliament. It would be used by President Yoweri Museveni, who has been in office since seizing power in 1986. Phone calls placed yesterday to Uganda's embassy were not answered."2-Sep-01,UGANDA (96%); UNITED STATES (94%); CENTRAL AFRICA (92%); KENYA (79%); AFRICA (79%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%),"Losing a disputed presidential election in Uganda in March was only the start of trouble for Kizza Besigye. Since then, plainclothes government agents shadowed the former candidate's house and tailed his car. When Besigye boarded a flight abroad, ""internal security"" dragged him off the plane. In the central African country so often celebrated for breaking the mold of ""big man"" rule, the life of the opposition politician was settling into a trough all too familiar on a continent where lip service to democracy tends to exceed its practice. The usual scenario appeared to be holding true when Besigye emerged in suburban Washington last month. Besigye said he escaped Uganda in secret, just hours ahead of arrest and ""possible physical harm."" By long African custom, Besigye's next move would be ""back to the bush,"" the announcement of a guerrilla movement to unseat President Yoweri Museveni, who came to power 15 years ago by just such a war. Instead, Besigye said he will hit Museveni where he lives, by taking aim at foreign aid. ""The budget of Uganda is still more than 50 percent from the Western donors,"" Besigye said in a telephone interview from suburban Virginia. ""The money he's using to commit this oppression is coming from U.S. taxpayers. ""I am here to tell people in the administration that Uganda, contrary to what they have come to expect, is no longer hewing to the path of democratization and has in fact become a dictatorship."" That message will find an attentive but hesitant audience in Washington, according to diplomats and aid officials in East Africa and the United States. Museveni has enjoyed generous support from Western donors impressed by Uganda's economic progress and often thoughtful governance. Museveni's pioneering fight against AIDS helped reverse the scourge in Uganda. But Besigye, a former adviser to Museveni and official in his government, impressed outside observers with his presidential campaign, which focused on burgeoning corruption. And though he lost, 69 percent to 28 percent, Besigye appeared more the statesman afterward. Already under surveillance, he vowed to continue his reform movement through peaceful means, including an unsuccessful court appeal of the election results. Meanwhile, Museveni, whose government has tightly restricted political activity since he came to power, called Besigye a ""traitor"" and suggested he was linked to pipe bombings in Kampala, the capital, which have previously been blamed on minor rebel groups. Museveni also said he would punish areas that failed to support him in the March election by reducing government services there. The imperious flourishes further marred Museveni's standing, already reduced by corruption scandals at home and military misadventure in neighboring Congo. Besigye, a retired colonel in the Ugandan army, said only two people besides Museveni knew the president was ordering troops across the Congolese border in August 1998. Once there, the army fought with its nominal ally, Rwanda, and drew allegations that senior Ugandan officials were looting timber, gold and other resources. Besigye said the World Bank and International Monetary Fund should demand ""democratization benchmarks just like you have economic benchmarks."" Museveni's penchant for personalizing rule -- and failure to create democratic institutions that will survive him -- are at least as important to Uganda's future as macroeconomics, Besigye said. While the World Bank threatened Museveni with a cut in aid after the fighting against Rwanda, the bank and IMF prefer to leave it to individual donor countries -- led in Uganda's case by Britain, the United States and Scandinavian countries -- to set political conditions for aid. A State Department official noted that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell met with both Museveni and Besigye during a visit to Uganda in May. Afterward, he urged Uganda toward greater political freedom. ""We have never been that easy on Museveni,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity."28-Jan-87,UGANDA (98%);,"A year after leading his guerrilla movement to power in Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni now finds himself mired in economic problems that could erode his popularity. Prominent Ugandans and Western donors say the economy, shattered by years of war, mismanagement and corruption, is the most serious issue facing Mr. Museveni's Government. They say, however, that the President has offered few concrete strategies. While he has brought peace to most of a country long resigned to violence, he has found it virtually impossible to translate promises of economic progress into positive performance. Some of his own policies have had a disastrous effect on Uganda's fiscal condition, according to economic specialists. In a speech this week to mark the first anniversary of the takeover, President Museveni promised to bring about economic changes. Agriculture and Industry Blaming past Governments for most of the decay, he said his National Resistance Movement would move to revive production in the devastated agricultural and industrial sectors in an effort to increase foreign exchange. He stressed ''self-reliance'' in rebuilding the economy and said foreign aid would be welcomed only if international donors did not ''interfere'' with the Government's own policies. ''In the same way we fought the hard war against Obote, we are going to fight economic stagnation and I am sure we are going to win, so let us be optimistic,'' Mr. Museveni. Milton Obote is the former leader against whom Mr. Museveni's forces fought a four-year bush war. Looking to World Bank Despite his calls for self-reliance, Mr. Museveni is now looking to the World Bank and other sources for help. As a prerequisite for additional aid, according to economists, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and others want Mr. Museveni to move forward immediately with dramatic economic changes, including devaluation of Uganda's currency, increasing key agricultural producer prices and adopting other measures to restore stability and growth. Western and Ugandan economic specialists say that Mr. Museveni, while variously labeled as a Socialist or Marxist, is above all a pragmatist. He is aware that, unless he reaches some type of agreement with those donors who are insisting on bold measures to improve the economy, he cannot hope to establish stability. Mr. Museveni inherited a treasury that contained only about $500,000 in foreign exchange, the result of profligate spending on arms and staggering corruption in the Government headed by Mr. Obote and Maj. Gen. Tito Okello, which Mr. Museveni's National Resistance Army ousted last January. $1.6 Billion Foreign Debt Ugandan and Western economic specialists say that of the $400 million the country takes in each year in export earnings, at least 90 percent of it from coffee, more than half goes toward servicing a $1.6 billion foreign debt and much of the rest is used to purchase oil and sugar and meet the army's needs for spare parts and other material. Inflation in Uganda is running as high as 200 percent, and low prices to farmers serve as a disincentive to agricultural production in a country of rich soil and mild equatorial climate. While the minimum wage is about $6 a month, the flourishing black market often sets prices locally, resulting in meat being offered for nearly $7 for two pounds. 'Not Doing Enough' ''Museveni is not doing enough,'' the Rev. Wilson Sentongo said, waiting along with scores of others in a town outside Kampala for rations of food and other supplies. ''Rehabilitation by the Government is very slow. We do not know what their plan is. They are telling us to tolerate things. Museveni has sympathy for us, we know, but the problem is supplies are not here and we need help.'' At the same time, members of Mr. Museveni's Government and many other Ugandans are deeply divided over whether the country should swallow the changes insisted on by international donors. At the center of the debate is the issue of devaluation. In its first year in office, the Government revalued the currency from 5,000 to 1,400 shillings to the dollar, saying that the move would make imports cheaper. But exports have become increasingly expensive. Devaluation Debated Some hard-line nationalists in Government insist that the cost of devaluation would be devastating. The cost of such imports as sugar, cooking oil and soap would increase significantly, they say, making the average Ugandan even worse off than he is now. Others are arguing that devaluation would earn the Government millions of dollars in revenue and encourage production in manufacturing and agriculture. They say that, if there is no currency adjustment, the Government will be forced to subsidized production. These people insist that if devaluation were introduced, an additional monthly increase in inflation would only be felt briefly and that prices would soon stabilize and inflation would slow down. ''It's not good enough for the World Bank and I.M.F. to say devalue,'' said a leading Ugandan lawyer. ''They must give us massive aid to counteract the effects of devaluation. Mr. Museveni said a war against rebels in the north continued to plague his Government, though recent victories against the insurgents, who consist of remnants of armies of Idi Amin, Mr. Obote and General Okello had brought an end to the conflict closer. Mr. Museveni's Government has virtually ended the violence and atrocities that have become synonymous with Uganda, a nation repeatedly bludgeoned by corrupt dictatorship, tribal wars and brutal human rights abuses since it gained independence from Britain in 1962."19-Jul-81,UGANDA (98%); UNITED STATES (79%); AFRICA (79%);,"A train hit a truck at a railroad crossing near Kampala the other day and people were hurt. To some careful observers of Uganda's affairs, it was cause for a small celebration - not the accident, but the fact that a train had been operating. ''Two years ago, there were no trains at all,'' one analyst said. ''It's not much, but it's something.'' Only in Uganda, perhaps, could optimism be woven from such frail thread. The assessment came from a foreigner. Ugandans seem less willing to build dreams on the cold reality of economic deprivation, political and tribal division and fragile security. ''You cannot find a single Ugandan who will live an honest life and make ends meet if they depend solely on their wages,'' said Paul Ssemogerere, leader of the opposition Democratic Party. ''The only way people survive is to get a second job. The other way is to engage in corrupt practices, selling their signature, bribery, demanding money for services that should otherwise be free. Corruption becomes a big temptation.'' The temptation can be very big, indeed. Coffee, for instance, the source of 97 percent of Uganda's foreign exchange earnings, has become a target for manipulation. The head of the Coffee Marketing Board, through which all coffee sales officially go, is the army chief of staff. Magendo, or the black market, thrives. The Fruits of Neglect Western economists take heart, however, from President Milton Obote's budget, announced last month, which they praise as a bold free market document, virtually unique in Africa. He has set the Ugandan shilling free to float and removed official price restraints. The spread between black market and official rates of exchange for the United States dollar has narrowed sharply, from 10 times the official price to a mere four times the new official rate.  The budget was Uganda's side of a bargain with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. They provided $197 million for essential imports, to help beat the black market and revive sectors that collapsed during eight years of former President Idi Amin's mismanagement. For example, under General Amin, no one looked at the Kampala water supply; now there is a typhoid outbreak. The main hospital for typhoid patients has had no direct water supply for five years. ''Now we've got the pumps working again,'' an engineer said.  ''The problem is that we don't think the pipes will take the pressure.'' General Amin is also blamed for the virtual collapse of wholesale-retail trade, once directed by tens of thousands of Asians whom he expelled after seizing power from Mr. Obote in 1971. But the new budget has had little immediate effect for most Ugandans. Many earn less than $25 a month (at the new exchange rate), while a family's basic monthly food bill is twice that amount and the inflation rate is 100 percent. ''The impact of the budget will only be felt when the pipeline of goods bought with aid money starts flowing. That could take some time,'' a Western economist said. ''Some things have already improved,'' he added. ''You can get sugar now, and it's cheaper than before. If favoritism in allocating import licences and corrupt handling of foreign exchange is stopped, then the budget has a good chance.'' Some analysts, however, do not believe favoritism and corruption will be easily eradicated. Unless there are economic benefits for the 12 million people, they warn, there will be no basis for reducing tribal and political hatreds or for undercutting popular support for the many guerrilla groups opposing Mr. Obote or, eventually, for restoring discipline to the army. The army is said to number 8,000 to 10,000 men - reportedly, no one at headquarters knows the total - underpaid and disorderly, largely from the Lango and Acholi people of the northeast, Mr.  Obote's home area. They do not get on with the 3.5 million Baganda people, the biggest tribe, who live in the south. ''Uganda cannot work without our cooperation,'' said a leading Baganda tribe member, who asked not to be identified. ''That cooperation will not be forthcoming unless we see an end to northerners enriching themselves at our expense and until the army stops robbing and killing.  Bagandans are not violent people, but they are being forced to side with the guerrillas.'' Mr. Obote returned to power in December in elections that opposition spokesmen have charged were rigged. His people had been brutalized by Mr. Amin's regime and now his army is exacting reprisals. Last month, soldiers gunned down more than 50 unarmed civilians at Ombachi mission in West Nile province, where Mr. Amin recruited soldiers, including his own Kakwa people. Opposition leaders have accused the Obote regime of ''systematic violation of human rights'' - arbitrary arrest, detention without trial and killing of opponents. But Mr. Obote's supporters blame disorder on ''bad elements'' left from previous regimes. They point out that the opposition operates freely in Parliament and can sell its newspapers. Since General Amin's ouster by Tanzanian troops and a small force of Ugandan exiles in April 1979, Ugandans have had two civilian governments, a military regime and, now, Mr. Obote. In the turmoil, they somehow display resilience. On a recent Sunday at a busy Kampala intersection where potholes had taken over the road, a jeepload of soldiers with a machine gun were busy ''raiding'' the area for suspected guerrillas. Nearby, policemen at one of Uganda's ubiquitous roadblocks held up cars. Sunday, however, is a time for relaxation and in sight of both police and army, a group of Ugandans took to the field of a dilapidated sports club, playing cricket in the warm sunlight."19-Aug-87,UGANDA (99%); KENYA (92%); RWANDA (92%);,"Six months ago, a small-time Ugandan smuggler who sold five gallons of gasoline in neighboring countries could make three times more in one day than a Ugandan Government minister received as a monthly salary. With cans of fuel strapped to rickety bicycles or balanced on top of their heads, Ugandan peasants would travel across the border to Kenya or Rwanda and easily get $20 for gasoline for which they paid the equivalent of $2. Back in Uganda, they could sell the foreign currency at the black market rate of 16,000 Ugandan shillings to the dollar, reaping a net profit of 288,000 shillings. This allowed them to purchase scarce commodities like soap, sugar and cooking oil. A Government minister's monthly salary last January was about 90,000 shillings, and the minimum monthly wage was 10,000 shillings at the official exchange rate, which was not enough to buy a stem of bananas or two pounds of sugar. Business these days, however, is not as profitable for the illegal traders. The price of gasoline, which was set artificially low, has been increased by 50 percent to bring it closer to the commodity's real market value, thus diminishing the incentive for smuggling. Agricultural Economy Sought In this and other ways, the Government of President Yoweri Museveni is attempting to resuscitate an agriculturally based economy shattered by years of war, mismanagement and corruption. Last January, a year after Mr. Museveni seized power, prominent Ugandans and Western donors said the state of the economy was the most serious issue facing the Government but that the President had offered few concrete strategies to deal with it. Some of Mr. Museveni's early policies were criticized as having had a disastrous effect on Uganda's fiscal condition. But since then, economic specialists say, the President has come to terms with the need for bold measures to improve the economy. He has reached new loan agreements with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank that require tight monetary policies. His Government has devalued the currency by more than 75 percent, introduced a new shilling worth 100 old shillings and levied a 30 percent tax on all money converted from old to new in a move to reduce the overall money supply. The old currency had been made almost worthless by spiraling inflation and a huge gap between official and black market exchange rates. Mr. Museveni has also announced increases of up to 500 percent in prices paid to farmers, as an incentive to revive agricultural production. The Government currently derives two-thirds of its income from coffee exports, which account for 95 percent of Uganda's export earnings. Civil Servants' Salaries Up Mr. Museveni also doubled the salaries of civil servants to restore some of their lost purchasing power. Uganda is to receive $310 million in aid from major donor nations over the next year, $50 million more than the country had sought to finance imports of essential raw materials, spare parts and capital goods needed to get idle productive capacity employed again. The Paris Club of bilateral and multilateral aid donors has rescheduled all the debt repayments Uganda should have made in the current financial year, saving the country $66 million. Uganda's total debt service liability had been running at about $200 million a year, which represented about half of its export earnings. ''The economic reforms represent an intellectual and policy watershed,'' said one Western diplomat familiar with the economy. ''The President had intensive dialogues with the I.M.F. and World Bank that had the quality of a graduate seminar in economics and he is deeply committed to these reforms. The Western donors did not beat him up and make him cry uncle.'' But Ugandan economists, Western diplomats and others agree that it will take years to pull the country from its economic quagmire. Mr. Museveni inherited a treasury of only about $500,000 in foreign exchange, the result of profligate spending on arms and staggering corruption in the Government headed by Milton Obote, the former leader against whom Mr. Museveni's forces fought a four-year bush war, and Maj. Gen. Tito Okello. Mr. Museveni's National Resistance Army ousted Mr. Okello's Government in January 1986. From 1970 to 1985, according to Government statistics, the country's agricultural output fell by 30 percent and industrial output by more than 50 percent. Per capita income declined by more than 40 percent. A study by an international labor organization showed that Uganda's factories were operating at less than 20 percent of capacity because of a chronic shortage of foreign exchange to buy imported raw materials and spare parts. ''It won't be easy, no matter how sound our economic policies,'' a Uganda economist said. ''The economy is still shrinking, but in Uganda, we should try to look at the bright side for a change. Three years ago, the gross domestic product fell about 3 percent. Last year, it shrank by less than 1 percent. That has to be considered good in Uganda.''"31-May-80,UGANDA (99%); UNITED STATES (94%); KENYA (92%);,"Two Ugandans employed by the U.S. private aid agency CARE have been killed by Ugandan soldiers, the U.S. Embassy in Kampala, Uganda, said today. The killings, reminiscent of countless murders carried out by Gen. Idi Admin's dictatorship, which was overthrown last year, came just two weeks after a military coup ousted the civilian Ugandan government headed by Godfrey Binaisa. Western nations have been uneasy for months about the security of their aid missions in Uganda.  The two Ugandans' deaths at the hands of the military could lead the Western countries to curtail assistance programs that are badly needed by Uganda.  The country has been devastated by eight years of Amin's bloody rule, a six-month war to overthrow him and ensuing chaos and corruption. U.S. Charge David Halsted said in a telephone interview from Kampala that he took up the matter with the Ugandan Foreign Ministry yesterday after the two bodies were found with bullet holes in their backs. They were discovered in the Namanve Forest outside Kampala, a favorite dumping ground for bodies used by Amin's notorious State Research Bureau, which was responsible for numerous killings.  Estimates of those killed under Amin range as high as half a million. Halsted said a Foreign Ministry official expressed shock at the killings and said the government would investigate.  There has been no official Ugandan statement. The two men, Walter Wakudsune and Christopher Musoke, both in their late 20's, were employees of CARE, an American-based private agency specializing in Third World development aid.  Wakudsune and Musoke were supervisors of a school rehabilitation project outside Kampala being carried out by CARE.  The project was partially funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development. Witnesses said Ugandan soldiers stopped the two men while they were riding in a CARE vehicle Tuesday and took them away in the direction of a military barracks, according to U.S. AID Director Chuck Grader, who later identified the bodies. The next day, soldiers were seen driving the CARE vehicle on the streets of Kampala. When Grader questioned the military, he was told that there had been only one person stopped, a military deserter, and that he had escaped.  Halsted said this was impossible since the two men had worked for CARE since last June, long before the reconstituted Ugandan Army was formed. ""It will be important to see how the government of Uganda deals with these murders and brings to justice those responsible,"" Halsted said, an indication that Western patience with the security situation was wearing thin. i The deaths were the first of persons involved with U.S. assistance projects in the country.  Earlier this month, however, a Ugandan driver for the International Communications Agency was killed by unknown assailants. The United Nations temporarily pulled all its personnel out of Uganda last August after a British U.N. official and a Ugandan driver were killed. Problems with the military go back to the Amin days when soldiers were given free reign to commit acts of violence.  Most of The 40,000-man Tanzanian Army, which led the fight to overthrow Amin, was not paid and learned to live off the land in Uganda.  The fledging 5,000-man Ugandan military has often followed the same pattern since its formation late last year. A priest was killed earlier this month in the drought-stricken northern area, although most likely by bandits. The violence has not spared even officials of the new government.  A former ambassador was roughed up and robbed at gunpoint by soldiers in the lobby of Kampala's leading hotel two days after the May 19 coup. U.S. AID's Grader and Francesco Strippoli, deputy director of the U.S. World Food Program, were held for three hours by Ugandan troops last week during a tour of the drought area. Uganda has complained that little Western aid has been delivered since Amin was toppled last year.  About $300 million in aid is projected, mainly from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and The European Economic Community. The United States has programmed about $6 million. Beside the security situation, AID officials complain of lack of coordination by the government, serious currency problems, which have spawned a huge black market and corruption, which makes it difficult to guarantee that aid commodities will get to the intended beneficiaries. ""From a development point of view, development must start with the host,"" one official said. Another diplomat said there have been thieves and outlaws before, ""but it's another thing when the source of insecurity is the country's own army."" There are eight U.S. embassy and AID personnel in Uganda and about 150 private American citizens."30-Jan-84,UNITED STATES (79%); SWITZERLAND (79%); NIGERIA (79%); FRANCE (58%);,"The Economy Fourth-quarter 1983 corporate profits are up 25 percent over the 1982 level, economists predict.

Wolfowitz has made the fight against corruption in poor countries a hallmark issue, waging an aggressive campaign that has led to the suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and contracts to nations including India, Chad, Kenya, Congo, Ethiopia and Bangladesh. It is a new incarnation for Mr. Wolfowitz, a neoconservative intellectual who was a primary architect of the Iraq war during four years as deputy secretary of defense. At the World Bank, Mr. Wolfowitz, 62, has maintained an assertive but soft-spoken style, saying recently that the bank's mission was ''to send children to school, to help mothers be healthier, to provide jobs for poor people -- not to have resources siphoned off into the hands of the corrupt and greedy.'' In recent months, however, his campaign has run into a host of critics, both at the bank and among financial officials outside the United States, who say that developing countries are being threatened with arbitrary punishment in a way that jeopardizes the bank's longtime mission to reduce poverty. Few here at the World Bank dispute the idea that corruption is a serious problem, but the rift over Mr. Wolfowitz's approach has grown deep and bitter, according to more than a dozen bank officials interviewed recently. The backlash at the bank against Mr. Wolfowitz's approach centers not on his intentions or goals, but on a widespread fear that countries will be categorized in the future as corrupt or not corrupt, and that lending will be shut off in a selective way. ''Anticorruption efforts are an essential part of development finance,'' said Roberto Danino, a senior vice president of the bank until early this year. ''But getting rid of corruption is not a silver bullet. The bank should not overemphasize its anticorruption agenda at the expense of other policies required for development.'' Mr. Wolfowitz acknowledges that his decisions to suspend or delay loans, contracts and debt relief funds for many countries have provoked outcries, but he says that in almost every case, the funds were restored after safeguards were set up. He has begun firing back at the critics at internal meetings and in public statements. He notes, for example, that the bank's lending under his leadership actually rose slightly last year, to nearly $23 billion. Mr. Wolfowitz says he has tried to rebut what he calls the myth that combating fraud is ''somehow at odds with development or becomes an excuse not to provide assistance.'' While no one knows how much of the bank's resources have been improperly diverted, informal estimates range from 10 percent to the 25 percent that Mr. Wolfowitz says went to corrupt cronies and family members of Indonesia's leadership in the 1990's. During the Reagan administration, Mr. Wolfowitz served as assistant secretary of state for East Asia, and, in the Clinton years, as dean of the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. Some bank officials say that the widespread concern about Mr. Wolfowitz's approach reflects lingering doubts among many international aid specialists about his selection for the bank post by President Bush. The doubts center on Mr. Wolfowitz's role as a leading advocate of the American invasion of Iraq, with many critics contending that his zeal on corruption reminds them of what they say was his messianic but unrealistic faith that installing democracy by force in Iraq, and by other means through the Middle East, would bring stability to the region. The criticism has been especially sharp among Europeans at the bank, where many officials say that judgments about what constitutes ''good governance'' could rupture the bank's delicate relationships with aid recipients, especially if the judgments are based on information gathered from dissidents and other critics in those countries. ''We must not use corruption as an excuse for a massive withdrawal of our help,'' a senior French finance official involved in discussions with the bank said. The official was among many who agreed to discuss the internal debate only on condition of anonymity. In recent months, Mr. Wolfowitz and his aides have been negotiating with skeptical members of the bank's board of 24 executive directors from around the world on guidelines for handling corruption issues. Several of the meetings have been contentious, participants say. This week, the board forwarded a draft of the guidelines and policies for approval by the world's finance ministers at the annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which begins Thursday in Singapore. But many officials said they expected the arguments to continue there and into the future. Several longtime bank officials say they cannot remember when board members wrangled over the wording of a policy paper with a bank president. At recent meetings, directors demanded that Mr. Wolfowitz agree to a greater role for the board in any future decisions on cutting off aid. In addition, members forced the deletion of language suggesting that the United Nations' goal of reducing world poverty 50 percent by 2015 would have to take second place to the bank's drive against corruption. Still, Britain and other European and developing countries remain skeptical on what may happen when the document is approved, bank officials said. ''The bank,'' a board member said, ''should not become a world policeman pointing its moral finger and conditioning everything on whether or not a country is believed to be corrupt. The more the bank goes beyond its old mandate of reducing poverty, the more problems will come up.'' In an interview, Mr. Wolfowitz acknowledged that the idea of drafting a paper on bank corruption policies had been urged on him out of fear that he would punish countries without consulting the board. He said he did not take the criticism as personally directed at him or his record on Iraq. ''I think some of the board members,'' Mr. Wolfowitz said, ''are legitimately afraid that as soon as you start criticizing, the next thing you're going to do is wag your finger and say, 'You're not going to get money unless you behave.' That's not our objective. Our objective is to make the lending go up.'' Past actions taken on behalf of the bank have involved a variety of presumed improprieties. For example, aides to Mr. Wolfowitz said he suspended debt relief talks with Congo because he was dissatisfied with audits of its state oil company. They said he expressed indignation over news reports about extravagant hotel bills incurred by Congo's president during United Nations General Assembly meetings in New York last September. The bank has looked at, among other things, accusations of corrupt bidding practices for road projects in Bangladesh, kickbacks to politicians in Argentina and the resignation of high officials in Kenya linked to projects there. By all accounts, a pivotal moment in Mr. Wolfowitz's campaign came last year when the bank suspended $800 million in loans for maternal and children's health in India in response to assertions that illicit payments had been going to officials. Nancy Boswell, president of Transparency International USA, a nongovernmental monitoring group that strongly supports Mr. Wolfowitz's efforts on corruption, said, ''It sent a tremor through the bank that Wolfowitz was serious, that he was going to ask hard questions, look at the track record of countries and make some changes.'' But many at the bank complained that the action had been taken without consultation, and protests were lodged by top aides to Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, bank officials said. Few would characterize the bank's 10,000 employees, 70 percent of whom work in Washington, as enthusiastic supporters of the Bush administration. Since taking office, Mr. Wolfowitz has told staff members that he wants to listen to them. He has impressed many with his trips to Africa and advocacy of debt relief for the poorest countries. But distrust of Mr. Wolfowitz remains high, in part because, according to some, he has not given enough credit to his predecessor, James D. Wolfensohn, who spoke out against corruption and set up the bank's first investigative unit in the late 1990's. When Mr. Wolfowitz arrived, he acknowledged Mr. Wolfensohn's efforts, but also complained that the fraud unit had more than 300 unresolved cases. He increased its budget nearly 50 percent and appointed a new director. He has also set up a program for companies to disclose bribes they paid in order to avoid sanctions. Currently, about 330 companies accused of corruption have been barred from bank-financed business or been otherwise penalized. The bank is trying to get nations and other international aid agencies to take similar action. Mr. Wolfowitz's management style also grates on some bank officials, with a number of them complaining that he has relied on a small coterie of loyal aides. ''He presumes,'' said Mr. Danino, the former bank senior vice president and once prime minister of Peru, ''that anyone who opposes him is either incompetent or corrupt.'' But supporters say Mr. Wolfowitz is determined to shake up the bank and was inspired to move on corruption by staff members, especially those posted outside Washington and Europe. They say he has had to battle a mentality that emphasizes loan programs, not crackdowns on corrupt individuals. ''Let's face it, promotion at the World Bank comes from spending money,'' said John Githongo, a onetime campaigner against corruption in Kenya who has fled to safety in Britain and is now an adviser to Mr. Wolfowitz. ''If you're in the field, and too many complaints about corruption interrupt the spending, it has an impact on your career trajectory.''

He argues for increasing aid to Russia. However, current assistance to Russia is inefficient because of the corruption on the receiving end. It is part of the Russian character to seek out and profit from loopholes in the bureaucratic structure. Gogol's character Chichikov profited from a loophole by buying up dead souls. The Soviet period did not alter this because Marxism did not contain an explicit ethical system. Today, exploiting loopholes and other scams have led to outright criminal activity, from counterfeiting to phony voucher investment funds. The International Monetary Fund has proceeded with proper caution. Its managing director commented that the I.M.F. is afraid to grant a $6 billion fund to stabilize the ruble because the money would end up in European bank accounts days later. Production in Russian oilfields drops each year, yet oil exports have increased. One of three barrels of oil is exported to the West for hard currency by unofficial means. The revenue goes to private bank accounts. How has President Boris N. Yeltsin dealt with this problem? According to the Russian Petroleum Investor, Mr. Yeltsin allegedly abolished the Commission on Combatting Corruption after pressure by the Russian oil and gas producers accused by the commission of illegal exports and hard currency violations. What can the United States do about this problem? I propose expanding the Peace Corps for Russia to include not only business advisers and teachers of English, but also American observers fluent in Russian to help prevent the diversion of food and medical supplies to the black market. The minimal costs needed would be more than offset by getting aid to the right people. Using most Russian officials to deliver Western aid is analogous to distributing food aid to Somalia through Somali warlords.

""Fragile"" countries, whose deepening poverty puts them at risk from terrorism, armed conflict and epidemic disease, have jumped to 26 from 17 since the report was last issued in 2003. Five states graduated off the list, but 14 made new appearances, including Nigeria and seven other African countries, Kosovo, Cambodia, East Timor, and the West Bank and Gaza. Twelve states, including Afghanistan, Somalia and Sudan, made both lists. ""Past international engagement with these countries has failed to yield significant improvements,"" said the assessment released by the World Bank's Independent Evaluation Group, which reports on the bank's programs to the board of directors. It was timed to coincide with the annual meeting of the bank and the International Monetary Fund this month in Singapore. Hurdles facing the countries at risk, often referred to as ""failed"" or ""failing"" states, include ""weak security, fractured societal relations, corruption, breakdown in the rule of law, lack of mechanisms for generating legitimate power and authority"" and limited investment resources to meet basic needs, the report said. To avoid ""adverse spillover effects  --  such as conflict, terrorism and epidemic diseases  --  the international community and the Bank need to find more effective ways"" of assisting them, it said. The Bush administration has described failing states as a major threat to U.S. security. ""The danger they pose is now unparalleled,"" Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice wrote in a column that appeared late last year in The Washington Post. ""Absent responsible state authority, threats that would and should be contained within a country's borders can now melt into the world and wreak untold havoc. ""Weak and failing states,"" Rice said, ""serve as global pathways that facilitate the spread of pandemics, the movement of criminals and terrorists, and the proliferation of the world's most dangerous weapons."" The administration's updated counterterrorism strategy, published earlier this month, set economic development in ""failing states or states emerging from conflict"" as a key objective. Official U.S. foreign assistance to the least developed countries topped $27 billion in 2005, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, more than twice the level when Bush took office. That amount places the United States first among international donor nations in terms of absolute dollars, although Washington remains at the bottom when aid is tallied as a percentage of gross national product. The United States also scores higher than many other countries in the percentage of its aid that is spent on security, trade and food supplies rather than on more traditional forms of development efforts. In a major restructuring, the administration is increasingly directing assistance toward those countries whose governments are judged as heading in a positive direction in terms of institutional and economic development and U.S. security interests. In 2002, the World Bank launched its own initiative to expand assistance to fragile states and increased its lending to them by 67 percent, to $4.1 billion, between 2003 and 2005. Its report cited a number of lessons learned in the process. In several countries, there was either too much aid or too little. Assistance from all international donors, the report said, varied from nearly $200 per capita for East Timor to $15 per capita for the Central African Republic. In a number of cases, an influx of aid was not matched by a domestic reform agenda that would allow the country to adequately utilize it. In other countries, donors demanded too many reforms, too quickly. In Afghanistan, the report said, ""donor reforms have not been selective enough and have led to 120 pieces of legislation."" Donors sometimes disagreed about the goals of overlapping aid programs, making it ""difficult to achieve policy coherence"" in recipient countries, the report said. ""In Afghanistan, for example, the Ministry of Finance receives technical assistance for customs modernization from the Bank, USAID, the European Union"" and Britain's development aid program."17-Dec-12,UNITED STATES (94%); AFGHANISTAN (92%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%); IRAQ (79%); UKRAINE (79%),"Election turmoilPreliminary results in Egypt showed supporters of a draft constitution with a solid majority in first-round balloting.

C1"30-Jul-92,UNITED STATES (94%); AFRICA (92%); ARGENTINA (79%); NIGERIA (79%);,"WITH THE indictments yesterday, the BCCI case -- the greatest banking scandal in financial history -- comes more fully into view. Because Clark Clifford has been a major figure in Washington for some 45 years, the charges against him and his law partner, Robert A. Altman, will get much attention. But they were not the central figures in the enormous conspiracy that these indictments portray. Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman were only working for others and, according to the charges, taking bribes to do that work. The people running the bank used their depositors' money, the New York grand jury says, ""to expand the base of the criminal enterprise, to acquire and maintain political influence"" and to enrich themselves. Last year when the regulators shut down BCCI -- the Bank of Credit and Commerce International -- its books showed $ 20 billion in assets, but some $ 5 billion was missing. That would be bank robbery on a scale of which Willie Sutton never dreamed. The key figures, according to the New York indictments, included Agha Hasan Abedi and Swaleh Naqvi, both indicted in New York a year ago, as well as Ghaith Pharaon, Faisal Saud al Fulaij, Kamal Adham and Sayed Jawhary. Bribery was the bank's normal method of business, and while it was busy here in Washington, it preyed mainly on the Third World. Again according to the New York indictments: It defrauded the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, it bribed the heads of the governments' central banks in Argentina, Peru and Nigeria, it bribed officials of the African Development Bank and of four other African countries. Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman are being prosecuted on charges that involve their role in BCCI's illegal control over First American Bankshares, the largest bank in this region. BCCI wanted an American bank because it was good for its business. BCCI was engaged in many kinds of business, and one of them was laundering drug money. It pleaded guilty earlier to a laundering charge in Florida. This case raises questions that go far beyond whatever part Mr. Clifford may have played. For one, the Justice Department's contributions to the investigation have been conspicuously modest. The real initiative and energy are coming from Robert M. Morgenthau, the New York district attorney, and the New York indictments reach much farther than the federal one. Does that not strike you as curious? BCCI's operations in this country were a series of flagrant violations of American banking law. How did they successfully evade the federal bank regulators for a decade? If there ever was a scandal that invited a full-scale congressional investigation, this is it. The chairman of the House Banking Committee, Henry Gonzalez, has been pursuing his own inquiries, to his credit, and Sen. John F. Kerry has held some useful hearings. But beyond that Congress has shown even less interest than the Justice Department. There's still a great deal to be learned about the BCCI affair. To protect the integrity of the American banking system, it's essential that the enforcement authorities -- and in particular Mr. Morgenthau -- keep pushing ahead."31-May-07,UNITED STATES (94%); CHINA (93%); AFRICA (92%); LATIN AMERICA (79%); SUDAN (79%); MIDDLE EAST (79%); BRAZIL (79%); INDIA (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (55%),"THE TUMULTUOUS departure of Paul D. Wolfowitz from the World Bank has raised reasonable questions about whether the United States should continue to monopolize the nomination of presidents for that global institution. President Bush probably succeeded in curtailing the discussion yesterday by nominating Robert B. Zoellick for the job. Mr. Zoellick, who was U.S. trade representative during Mr. Bush's first term and has also held senior positions at the Treasury and State departments, is intelligent, experienced and effective; he has managed large bureaucracies and cut deals with governments from Latin America to China. He is a good choice to lead the bank; his American citizenship and identification with the Bush administration certainly should not disqualify him. Unlike Mr. Wolfowitz, Mr. Zoellick has a long history of commitment to multilateralism. As trade representative he helped to launch the ongoing global trade negotiations known as the Doha round and worked closely with his counterpart at the European Union, Pascal Lamy, now the head of the World Trade Organization. Mr. Zoellick's clear understanding of trade, and of how developing countries can use it to grow, should benefit the bank. So should his considerable experience with Africa, where he helped to broker peace negotiations in Darfur. If he is elected by the bank's board, the tricky challenges Mr. Zoellick will face only begin with restoring stability at the bank and successfully raising the $30 billion in fresh funds it needs to continue its grants and soft loans to the poorest countries. With global markets awash in capital, middle-income countries such as Brazil and China have much less need to borrow from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and some question whether institutions created to cope with the post-World War II world are still needed. In fact, as Mr. Wolfowitz recognized, the World Bank still has a vital role to play in Africa, not only as a source of grants and loans but as an aid to building institutions -- and, yes, in fighting corruption.  And it can still  do important projects in middle-income countries. For example, it can help to build a framework that would allow China, India and other rapidly industrializing countries to join rich nations in addressing climate change. It could help Middle Eastern countries participate in global flows of trade, investment and technology from which they have been largely excluded. If Mr. Zoellick can shore up the bank's place as a prime source of capital and technocratic guidance for the poorest countries and find new initiatives to pursue with the richer ones, he will have a chance of fulfilling the prediction he made yesterday: that ""the World Bank's best days are still to come."""5-Aug-83,"UNITED STATES (94%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (92%); AFRICA (79%); MIDDLE EAST (79%); LIBYAN ARAB JAMAHIRIYA (79%); CHAD (79%); CENTRAL AMERICA (70%); BELGIUM (54%);   LIBYA (79%);","Of the foreign trouble spots of the early 1960s, ""the Congo is the only place where U.S. policy could be described as a lasting success in cold war terms,"" Madeleine G. Kalb writes in her book, ""The Congo Cables."" And that success, she adds, ""has rested largely on the efforts of one right- wing general."" His name was Joseph Mobutu, and in the East-West power struggling over the newly independent Congo, he was the chosen instrument of the United States (and the CIA). In the natural course of ""Africanization,"" he now calls himself Mobutu Sese Seko. The Congo is called Zaire. Yesterday, as its president by a bloodless coup in 1965, he paid his second call on Ronald Reagan at the White House. And it is safe to say there are few world leaders that Ronald Reagan would rather be seen with at a time when his administration's foreign policy is checkmated in the Middle East, dangerously adrift in Central America and not going anywhere, so'd you'd notice, elsewhere in Africa or the Third World. Zaire's tumultuous history and the American involvement in it are nowhere better recorded than in Kalb's book: the mutiny of the security forces as the Belgian colonialists departed; the United Nations peace efforts; the mysterious murder of Patrice Lumumba; the near-secessions of what we used to call ""the breakaway Katanga province"" (now called Shaba) with its vast mineral riches; the bloodshed, the violence and the rough repression. Not a pretty story, in many ways. But a resounding defeat for the Soviets (remember Nikita Khrushchev's frustrations as he pounded his U.N. desk with his shoe?) and a ringing vindication of much that Ronald Reagan holds dear--if only a queasy Congress and a gun-shy public would free him up to practice things like timely military aid as needed and vigorous covert activity falling just short of U.S. combat involvement; a hard-eyed priority for the big picture of national security over the nitty-gritty of human rights and official corruption. That's the way the Congo game was played. And that is why the Mobutu government is almost a monument to U.S. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick's (and the administration's) doctrine on dictatorships. Mobutu is ""authoritarian"" as distinct from ""totalitarian"" (communist). He is staunchly anti-Soviet. His country is strategic by definition, for its vital minerals (cobalt, copper and diamonds) and its geography, smack in the middle of a sea of African instability. As we are seeing at this very moment, Mobutu is helpful. Some 2,000 of his troops are available in Chad for use against the invading forces of the noxious Libyan bomb-thrower, Muammar Qaddafi. The U.S. commitment to that struggle is measured by an emergency $10 million airlift of military supplies to Chad and the urgent delivery of hand-held anti-aircraft weapons to resist attacks by Libyan jets. Zaire has been a faithful friend as a member of the U.N. Security Council on the U.S. side of the Nicaraguan question. New York Mayor Ed Koch is not merely being polite by holding a reception for Mobutu; not long ago Zaire became the first African state to restore relations with Israel after the big African rupture with Israel at the time of the 1973 Mideast war. Mobutu meets another Kirkpatrick test of authoritarians: of late he has been moderately responsive to U.S. urging that he clean up his act on two counts. He has been releasing political detainees at home and allowing some important exiles in opposition to return to Zaire. He has also accepted a stiff regimen laid on him by the International Monetary Fund in the interest of sounder economic management. None of this is likely to appease Mobutu's American critics, mostly Democrats on the left. His high standing at the White House thus defines one side of a fundamental argument over American foreign policy in much the same way that U.S. support for the shah of Iran--and his downfall--joined the issue. For what Mobutu has not done, and probably cannot do, is to provide any succession process. ""He is it"" in Zaire, says one U.S. diplomat--which is fine, in some eyes, as far as it goes. But being ""it"" may also be an invitation to disastrous instability once this ""linchpin"" of central Africa, as an American expert describes Mobutu, is gone. In that sense, Mobutu Sese Seko is both a success symbol and an irrelevant relic of another time and a different world. Not just the U.S.-Soviet balance of power has changed. In the early '60s, the American public had yet to suffer through the shock of Vietnam, the relevations of CIA excesses, the multiple demonstrations over two decades of limits on U.S. power to control events. For all these reasons, ""the efforts of one right-wing general"" can no longer be counted on in the 1980s to safeguard the success of U.S. policies which actually did not even work all that perfectly 20 years ago."12-Apr-07,UNITED STATES (94%); IRAQ (92%); AFRICA (79%),"Growing hostility within the World Bank toward its president, Paul D. Wolfowitz, is raising questions about his ability to lead the big lending institution and raise money for a fund that assists the developing world. Wolfowitz's tenure, contentious from the start because of his earlier role as an architect of U.S. policy in Iraq, has been marred in recent months by a series of controversies. World Bank staffers disclosed that a woman with whom Wolfowitz is romantically involved received big pay raises from the bank. Sensitive board minutes regarding China have been leaked to the press, and blistering criticism has been leveled at Wolfowitz on an internal electronic bulletin board. The heightened tension comes as delegates from around the world convene in Washington this weekend for annual meetings of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and finance ministers for the major industrial powers. Wolfowitz sought to defray questions about the pay raises in a briefing with reporters yesterday and to focus attention on his priorities, which he has defined as dealing seriously with environmental problems, rooting out governmental corruption and fighting poverty, particularly in Africa. Wolfowitz noted that a committee has been appointed to review the situation involving Shaha Riza, to whom he has been romantically linked. ""I'm comfortable with that, and that's all I have to say on that,"" Wolfowitz said. ""I don't think its fair to the rest of the agenda to take up this valuable time with that."" Riza was transferred to the State Department shortly after Wolfowitz took over the World Bank in 2005, in accordance with conflict-of-interest rules. She is still paid by the bank and she has received raises that increased her pay to $193,590 from $132,660 after she was moved to the State Department in 2005, according to the bank's employee association. A Wolfowitz spokesman, who has previously said that Wolfowitz played no role in the raises, would not comment yesterday. Riza has made no public comment. There was no sign that Wolfowitz, who was appointed to the job at the recommendation of President Bush, was in imminent danger of being forced out. None of the World Bank's executive directors, who make up a 24-member board that governs the bank's operations along with Wolfowitz, have publicly withdrawn support. Board members have asked Wolfowitz to more clearly articulate the direction he intends to lead the bank for the rest of his five-year term, which ends in 2010. ""There are considerable questions about his leadership at the bank, and he faces some morale problems and questions coming from"" important member countries, said Edwin M. Truman, a senior fellow at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ""But I don't think that he's in jeopardy."" The 185-nation World Bank, which has a staff of 10,000 and lends about $20 billion a year to developing countries for projects such as classroom construction and the creation of financial systems, is carrying out a campaign to replenish the International Development Association fund, which lends money interest-free to the poorest countries. Raising the billions of dollars necessary to keep the fund running at its present level falls largely to Wolfowitz. Given the turmoil at the bank, some staff members have questioned whether rich countries would donate as generously to the fund as they have in the past. That is not likely to become clear until the end of this year, after countries announce their commitments. ""I think it will be a tragic mistake if the promise of increased aid is not delivered,"" Wolfowitz said. ""The U.S. should be a leader here. When it comes to IDA replenishment, frankly a lot of the donors are looking to see what the U.S. is going to do, particularly some of these small but relatively generous countries like the Nordic countries."" Even if Wolfowitz can manage to fill the fund's coffers, he has considerable mending to do inside the World Bank, said present and former staff members, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals or of offending Wolfowitz. Some staff members say Wolfowitz has lost their support, and an online discussion board on the bank's internal Web site has become a heated forum where critics have attacked Wolfowitz, especially over the issue of raises for his romantic partner. Posting anonymously, bank staffers have accused Wolfowitz of hypocrisy, noting that he has launched a campaign to root out corruption in the developing world even as he manages the bank in a way they view as corrupt. According to the World Bank Staff Association, Riza's pay increases violated bank rules that restrict the size of raises. Wolfowitz said in an e-mail to bank earlier this week that he will cooperate with an investigation by the bank's executive board. On other issues, senior bank officers felt compelled to defend a Wolfowitz decision to expand operations in Iraq after a staff driver was wounded in February at a checkpoint in Baghdad. Recent leaks of sensitive World Bank executive board deliberations to Fox News have fed the criticism. This week, bank officials said they hired a Washington law firm to hunt down the source of the unauthorized disclosures, which included an internal e-mail noting that the bank had received a warning from China that it might halt future borrowings if Wolfowitz refused to curb anti-corruption investigations. ""Critics, both inside and outside the World Bank, are openly questioning whether Wolfowitz's liabilities will undermine his leadership of the institution,"" said Manish Bapna, executive director of the Bank Information Center, a nonprofit organization in Washington that monitors the bank's activities. ""His relationship with staff, the board and with civil society remain highly strained, and some wonder what could even be done at this point to heal these festering wounds."""30-Jul-92,"UNITED STATES (94%); MIDDLE EAST (92%); IRAN, ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF (79%); NIGERIA (79%); MOROCCO (73%);","When he announced the first round of charges against the Bank of Credit and Commerce International last summer, New York District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau called the bank ""one of the most complex and secretive criminal organizations we have ever encountered."" Yesterday, Morgenthau fleshed out that description. In addition to the indictment charging Washington attorneys Clark M. Clifford and Robert A. Altman with fraud, conspiracy and receiving bribes for their roles in BCCI's illegal takeover of Washington's First American Bankshares Inc., Morgenthau announced a separate indictment containing a laundry list of charges against BCCI's chairman and president and two of their associates, which the indictment describes as the BCC Group. Rarely before has so much detail been offered about the inner workings of the bank once described by a CIA official as ""the bank of crooks and criminals international."" BCCI's intention, according to the second indictment: ""To acquire money and power."" BCCI, the indictment said, engaged in ""a pattern of criminal activity, which included large-scale, long-term collusive theft, repeated schemes to defraud bank regulators and bank depositors, the filing of false documents with public servants, the falsification of business records, bribery, commercial bribing, commercial bribe receiving, money laundering and conspiracies to commit those crimes. ... ""Members of the criminal enterprise made systematic efforts to influence the press by subsidies, payoffs and intimidation,"" the indictment said. ""They spent depositors' money on charities -- to gather favorable public reception and increase the political power of the BCC Group. They hired politicians and government employees as consultants to increase the BCC Group's access and influence in the various countries in which it operated and sought to operate, and to create a false aura of integrity for the BCC Group."" To further buttress BCCI's image, the indictment alleges, officials of the bank induced prominent Middle Eastern sheiks and financiers to pose as investors in BCCI, often with virtually nothing at risk for their purported investments. The indictment names no names, but Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, and Prince Mahmood Reza Pahlavi, brother of the former shah of Iran, have previously been listed as large and small investors in BCCI. The indictment says Agha Hasan Abedi, BCCI's founder and former chairman, and Swaleh Naqvi, his chief lieutenant, ran BCCI as a rogue bank, aided by a handful of rich Middle Eastern shareholders in the bank and many of its related enterprises, including First American. Originally conceived as a bank to serve the Third World, BCCI did some of its most illegal work in developing nations, according to the indictment, bribing officials of the Congo, Nigeria, Morocco, Senegal, Tunisia, the Ivory Coast, Argentina, Peru and other struggling nations to put their nations' funds into risky accounts at BCCI. ""Abedi and Naqvi plotted to deliver cash and other benefits to countries' finance ministers, heads of countries' central banks and senior executives of international and regional organizations to obtain deposits,"" the indictment said. ""Further, they sought to acquire permission to open banks, to receive preferential treatment in the release of foreign exchange and to get other banking business such as letters of credit."" In addition, the indictment alleges, BCCI defrauded the international financial organizations set up to aid developing nations by helping Pakistan, Senegal, Zambia, Nigeria and other nations ""to evade fiscal restraints placed on them by such world financial institutions as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund."" The indictment adds to previous allegations that BCCI's own finances were a sham, a house of cards supported by falsified documents, highly questionable accounts and rapid-fire movement of money around the world banking system that helped hide the bank's chronic financial woes from auditors and the few international regulators who could get a glimpse of its operations. When BCCI collapsed last year and was ordered shut down by international regulators, as much as $ 20 billion was believed by investigators to have disappeared with it. Investigators for Morgenthau's office and other law enforcement agencies are still tracking the money trail, hindered by their inability to get access to reams of documents still hidden in the Middle East. Yesterday's indictment listed BCCI's losses as $ 5 billion and counting, and accused BCCI and its leaders of ""a pattern of criminal activity, and with a continuity of existence, structure and criminal purpose beyond the scope of individual criminal incidents and consisting of individuals and a series of banks and bank holding companies, as well as related corporate and investment entities, in more than 70 countries around the world."""23-Apr-06,UNITED STATES (94%); PHILIPPINES (79%); CZECH REPUBLIC (79%); IRAQ (79%); AFRICA (79%); INDIA (72%),"At the opening of the annual spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on Thursday, a small group of protesters chanted, ''Corporate corruption, who can we thank?/ The I.M.F. and the World Bank!'' In less than a minute, security guards hustled the noisy protesters out of the news conference. That the moment, captured in Webcasts, fizzled so quickly was a sign of the surprising lack of controversy surrounding the 10-month tenure of Paul D. Wolfowitz as president of the World Bank, one of the most important antipoverty institutions. Mr. Wolfowitz, a former Pentagon official who became a lightning rod for criticism of the Iraq war and who was mocked by filmmaker Michael Moore in ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' for fussing with his hair, has defused much of the opposition from advocacy groups. Early in his tenure, he worked behind the scenes to push for debt relief, a cause popularized by the rock star Bono. On Friday, he announced that he had enough votes from bank shareholders to approve $37 billion in debt relief to 17 of the world's poorest countries, mostly in Africa. ''He didn't have to do that,'' said Max Lawson, a policy adviser with Oxfam. Mr. Wolfowitz has laid claim to the mantle of anticorruption crusader. In recent months, he has blocked or canceled more than $1 billion in loans to a range of developing countries. But he has done it in a way that appealed to both conservatives, who worry that aid is disappearing down a rat hole, and to anticorporate activists who fear that it is being stolen from the poor by corrupt rulers and the businessmen who bribe them. He has also on occasion shown a willingness to nip the hand of the Bush administration that used to feed him -- a tendency that has lessened suspicions that his appointment to head the World Bank would simply impose American interests. At a news conference on Friday, he gently chided the United States for the relatively small sums it gives to help educate the 100 million children in the developing world who are not in school. Certainly there is harsh criticism of Mr. Wolfowitz, but it seems tempered by a sense that his approach offers a chance for change at the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a lumbering institution often berated as secretive, bureaucratic and ineffective in dispensing billions of dollars in very low interest loans each year to poor countries. At a bacon-and-eggs news conference on Friday morning at the Old Ebbitt Grill, a clutch of advocacy groups -- with leaders from India, the Czech Republic and the Philippines -- laid out some of their recommendations for reform. The bank needs stronger protections for its own whistleblowers, they said. It should forgive debts incurred by thieving dictators. Its lending should be subjected to parliamentary oversight in developing countries with vital democracies. And it needs to even more comprehensively investigate allegations of corruption, especially those involving multinational corporations. ''This is a very important window in which we're making a number of constructive suggestions,'' said Smitu Kothari, director of Intercultural Resources, a New Delhi-based nonprofit research group. While Mr. Kothari did not criticize Mr. Wolfowitz's decision to hold up $660 million in lending to support India's health programs for women, children and victims of tuberculosis because of corruption in drug procurement, India's health minister, Dr. Anbumani Ramadoss, called the action unfair. India is the bank's largest borrower. That decision might once have prompted India, famously prickly about foreign hands in its affairs, to spurn Mr. Wolfowitz and his loans. But the new India, deeply engaged with the United States, is trying to accommodate him. ''I've done everything the World Bank asked,'' Dr. Ramadoss said during a telephone interview on Thursday. ''I have blacklisted all the companies they wanted. I've suspended officials there at that point in time.'' As well as highlighting his anticorruption theme, Mr. Wolfowitz has emphasized another cause during these spring meetings -- education. This week he appeared on a panel with Gordon Brown, th chancellor of the exchequer in Britain, and Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the Nigerian finance minister, to discuss education aid. Mr. Brown, who last week announced that Britain was committing $15 billion to education in the coming decade, four times what it spent in the past decade, said, ''It is one of the world's greatest scandals that must now be addressed that 100 million children are not going to school today.'' Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala began by telling how she had recently adopted a 17-year-old girl who had never had a chance to get an education, and who is now being privately tutored. The Nigerian minister said children needed to be able to read and write if they were ever to escape poverty, and invited donors to contribute to help education in the developing world. When the panel was asked who the laggards were among the donors, the audience tittered, and Mr. Wolfowitz took the question. He praised the British and the Dutch for their outstanding contributions. As for the United States, he said, it has raised its spending on education from about $100 million in 2002 to $260 million in 2004. ''If you stop and think about it, that's about $1 per capita, whereas I think the U.K. number is now up to $20 per capita,'' he said. ''So the U.S. could do a lot more.''"16-Dec-88,UNITED STATES (95%); LIBERIA (94%); AFRICA (79%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%);,"American credibility is not usually enhanced by retreats. Yet Washington's reluctant decision to withdraw a team of financial advisers from Liberia a year early could send a strong signal to others who would shamelessly abuse American aid. Gen. Samuel Doe's Government has thwarted the advisers' efforts to combat wide corruption. For them to stay would only countenance more of it. But the best way to get the message across would be for the new administration and Congress to further cut back American aid. Freed American slaves founded Liberia in 1847 and their descendants long ran it. America remains Liberia's largest foreign investor and trading partner. The Voice of America has a transmitter in the country, and U.S. military planes use its international airport. General Doe's bloody 1980 coup displaced the American-descended ruling clique. But under President Reagan, who once introduced the general as ''Chairman Moe,'' the relationship grew even warmer. Foreign aid was dramatically increased. During the Reagan years, nearly $500 million flowed from Washington to Monrovia, making Liberia the largest per capita U.S. aid recipient in sub-Saharan Africa. But very little of that aid ever reached the population. Well-connected Government employees have wallowed in luxury consumer goods and built foreign bank accounts. After a fraudulent election and an attempted coup in 1985, Congress put the brakes on U.S. aid. Payment arrears have jeopardized further help from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Last year, an embarrassed Reagan Administration sent in the financial experts. They worked hard but were ignored. Those in the Doe group seem interested only in helping themselves at Liberia's expense. There's no finer place to start cutting the U.S. budget deficit than by cutting them off at the pockets."13-Jul-03,UNITED STATES (95%); LIBERIA (95%); AFRICA (91%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%),"It seems like yesterday -- even though it was 1996 -- that I was tiptoeing along the darkened hallways of the presidential mansion in Monrovia, holding a small torch as I made my way to meet Liberian warlord Charles Taylor. His rebels jostled one another as they led me along. Taylor was then a 48-year-old bush soldier who had battled his way to the capital with a loaded bandoleer wrapped around his chest. Taylor was the Big Man in waiting, the latest aspirant to the ranks of self-ordained African leaders. This was a club that once included independence leaders with their own high-minded, if terribly misguided, theories about development. But over time, Africa's Big Men had been corrupted. And new Big Men came, less visionary, more dictatorial. In Liberia, it had come to this: A former security guard in Boston had murdered and cajoled his way within a whisper of genuine power. And there I was, in his bombed-out mansion, which sat in a kind of daylight truce zone of Monrovia, while fighting went on in the countryside by day and seemingly everywhere at night. There being no glass in the windows, velvet curtains swayed to reveal azure skies as Taylor sat there, a man who badly wanted to be president. Taylor shared the mansion with five other warlords, but he impressed many as the most ""presidential."" He was dressed in an eye-catching two-piece gray suit that buttoned at the neck. (The junior college he attended in Boston in the 1970s specialized in fashion design.) He always kept a valet in his employ, even when he was deep in the bush. The valet was Edmund Lewis, whom Taylor had recruited from the streets of Roxbury in Boston. Taylor, who had lived in Boston again in the mid-1980s, went tight-lipped when I asked about his 1985 escape from a Massachusetts prison, where he was being held for possible extradition to Liberia on embezzlement charges. But he talked about a lot of other things that day: New England, the Boston Celtics, his family and his reverence for the post-colonial leaders of Africa. He waxed on with stories of America's hold on the imaginations of himself and his countrymen as he was growing up. He mentioned the name ""Paul Cuffe,"" a name I'd never heard. Cuffe, a wealthy merchant and Quaker from New Bedford, Mass., was one of the first black Americans to steer a vessel across the Atlantic. Convinced that emigration back to Africa was the way for American blacks to realize full self-determination, he transported 38 black Americans to west Africa in 1815. In 1822, the American Colonization Society began to resettle free American blacks in Liberia. The settlers became known as Americo-Liberians. The Liberian constitution was modeled after America's. The capital was named after President James Monroe. The colors of the country's flag were red, white and blue. When independence washed across Africa in the 1950s and '60s, Liberians watched with pride and some bemusement: Freedom had been theirs for more than a century. So they went about their business, much of it linked to U.S. interests. Since 1926, Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. had a million-acre rubber plantation there. In 1943, the U.S. dollar became the legal tender. Coca Cola Co. had a big bottling operation. The 1960s were the halcyon years of African independence, when the Big Men emerged as leaders. Among them were Jomo Kenyatta in Kenya, Felix Houphouet-Boigny in the Ivory Coast, Julius Nyerere in Tanzania, Kenneth Kaunda in Zambia and Joseph Mobutu (later Mobutu Sese Seko, the ""sole guide"") in Zaire. Liberia's Big Man was William V.S. Tubman, its president from 1944 to 1971. Tubman was a big man because he was big with America, having allowed the CIA to use his country for a major spying station. But something foul had been brewing since shortly after the first black Americans landed in Liberia. A caste system grew, pitting Americo-Liberians against the native, indigenous population, notably the Krahn tribe, but the Gio and Mano as well. It was a kind of big city versus rube separation. Nelson Taylor, Charles Taylor's father, was proud that his family -- just like Tubman's -- belonged to the Americo-Liberian group. When Tubman died in 1971, William R. Tolbert, his vice president and another Americo-Liberian, assumed the presidency. Tolbert had dreams: He courted both China and Cuba. He called it diversifying his country's political ambitions. But jumping into bed with communists bewildered America, and was hard for Liberians to grasp. On April 12, 1980, Tolbert was murdered by Samuel Doe, a semi-literate sergeant in the Liberian Army -- and a Krahn. Doe became the first native Liberian to assume the presidency. (In 1982, Doe was invited to the White House, where President Reagan called him ""Chairman Moe."") But Doe unleashed a reign of terror. Less than two weeks after his coup, he had 13 members of the Tolbert government executed on the beach. They had been stripped, save for underpants, tied to posts, then shot. Doe also seemed to be trying to match Mobutu's bizarre eccentricities. He kept caged lions at the presidential mansion and let a white horse run free on the grounds. Doe terrorized many Liberians, seeking vengeance on behalf of the indigenous population. His adversaries set their sights on ousting him. Taylor, who had been politically active among Liberian exiles, returned to the country on Christmas Eve, 1989, and began his war. Doe kept Monrovia fortified and the fighting was waged in the bush. On July 30, 1990, however, a convoy of Doe's troops attacked St. Peter's Lutheran Church in the heart of Monrovia. Americo-Liberians had felt safe there with their children. When I visited the church, a priest told me 700 had died in that massacre. Among them was Taylor's father. Taylor swept through the bush, recruiting boy soldiers for his ragtag forces, firing old cannons from hillsides. Industries, along with many Liberians, fled to surrounding countries. On occasion, U.S. Marines were called in to evacuate American embassy personnel; Liberians would collapse on the beach, wailing that the American forces should repatriate them, owing to their ancestral links to America. The war became mind-boggling, with touches of Graham Greene, Chester Himes and George Orwell woven together. Former president Jimmy Carter tried hard to broker peace agreements. When I visited in 1996, fighting had already claimed more than 150,000 lives. One afternoon, I rode around with the ""Skeleton Team."" It was no team, just a lone truck driver assigned to collect skulls on the beach. That evening, I returned to the beach. A young woman came running in my direction and began yelling that I must leave because snipers came out at night. Her name was Rose and she was 19. She desperately wanted to go to college in America. Her birthday was a couple days away and all she wished for was a chocolate cake. Later, I found a former hotel cook, who was delivering wood and scrap metal. He said he could bake one if I found some flour, which I did. He gave me the cake inside a shoe box, and I took it to Rose. I used to hear from her after I left Liberia, but then the calls stopped. I wonder if she still looks out for anyone foolish enough to waltz along the beach. With elections in 1997, Taylor finally got his official claim to the presidential mansion. In time, Mobuto's walking stick became Taylor's walking stick. The Big Man grew adept at walking hard and carrying a big stick. And riding in big shiny cars. Even when I was in Monrovia, before he became president, a fleet of beautiful cars ferried Taylor and his cronies up and down the capital's dusty roads; the crowds nearly trampled over themselves to get a glimpse of him. But he, like Doe, stayed close to Monrovia, fearing insurgents plotting in the countryside. And he meddled murderously in neighboring Sierra Leone. By supporting the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Taylor prolonged a civil war in which thousands were murdered, raped, terrorized and pressed into forced labor. A U.N.-backed war crimes indictment claims Taylor backed the RUF while pillaging Sierra Leone's diamonds, which he and his cronies pocketed. Liberia is now left with an entire generation without proper education or much hope for its future. When I traveled with Taylor's boy soldiers into the bush -- a lovely land that reminded me of the way the countryside looked around my grandmother's farm in Georgia -- I listened to them at night as they would well up in tears. They'd wonder where their parents might be. But when morning came, their cockiness returned and they readied their rifles. For years one of the commandments of Big Man rule has been: Thou shall not criticize another Big Man. From his bush wars to his presidency, Taylor was rarely condemned by other African leaders, even though his presidency has been disastrous, with declining health care, falling incomes and the ruination of his country's infrastructure. The reigns of Sani Abacha in Nigeria and Mobutu went on far too long. And now, says the recent war crime indictment handed down, so has the rule of Charles Taylor. The U.S. government can ill afford to turn its back on Liberia again lest it become a haven for terrorists. That means more than just making Monrovia safe, a task that will require African peacekeepers, backed and coordinated by the U.S. military. The United States should also create an interdisciplinary committee to revive the country. It might include the likes of former congressman Ron Dellums; former governors Thomas Kean and L. Douglas Wilder; ""Dead Man Walking"" author Sister Helen Prejean; a player from Liberia's roster of exiled soccer stars; and a World Bank or International Monetary Fund representative. The King Center in Atlanta could join the effort. It could be a second coming of Americans, like those who ventured to Liberia's shores so many years ago. As for Charles Taylor, he has begun to sound like a butler battered during a dining room scuffle. He says he will simply retreat to Nigeria -- to write and perhaps reemerge in due time. His rescuer is another Big Man, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo. Obasanjo commands enormous respect in Africa, which is why Taylor may be willing to step aside. Plus, Obasanjo has said he will ignore Taylor's war crimes indictment. Sitting in that bombed-out mansion, Charles Taylor had sounded so hopeful, so dreamy. Coming through the bush to stop the beheadings of his people, he may truly have believed in his cause. But he appears to have suffered from a familiar African malady: A dream of the heart swallowed whole by the darkness of the mind.

The plan, disclosed at the 22d annual summit meeting of the Group of Seven countries, would allow the United States and other countries to post investigators on foreign soil and would require the seven allies to crack down on the import and export of firearms. The plan was under development before the terrorist bombing on Tuesday that killed 19 American servicemen in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. But President Clinton, seizing the moment to drag along allies who have often been reluctant to agree on concrete steps that impinge on their national sovereignty, pressed to tighten some of the provisions. Some of the steps, originally packaged as a broader anti-crime initiative, appeared aimed more at drug dealers and corrupt business executives than at terrorists. But Administration officials pointed to requirements that nations coordinate prosecutions when crimes occur across borders and that they ""insure that criminals and terrorists are brought to justice and tried"" even if extradition proves impossible. The other members of the Group of Seven -- Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan -- are also bound to develop witness protection programs, much like the one used in the United States, to give new identities to people who testify against organized crime groups. While they were eager to portray the agreement as major progress, Administration officials conceded today that turning those general agreements into national laws and regulations would be a long struggle. ""These are countries that often can't agree on the rules for selling planes to China or moving lumber across borders,"" a senior Administration official said tonight. ""We'd be fooling ourselves to think any of this will happen instantly. But it's a start."" An example of the complications over extradition was unfolding in Rome as the leaders gathered: this week, Italy's constitutional court blocked the extradition to Florida of a man wanted on charges of first-degree murder because he could face the death penalty. Italian law does not permit the death penalty. The anti-crime and anti-terrorism principles would require major changes in Italian and Russian laws, and major changes in common practices elsewhere. For example, the new rules call for all the G-7 nations to strengthen ""laws to prevent bribery and extortion."" While that sounds non-controversial, until a few months ago German companies paying bribes abroad were permitted to deduct them from their taxes. The most visible divisions among the leaders were over American efforts to isolate Iran, Libya and Cuba and over strategies to relieve the world's poorest nations from their huge debt loads. Several leaders chastised Mr. Clinton for signing legislation that would punish foreign companies that do business with Cuba and for announcing that he would go along with a bill approved by Congress a week ago that would similarly penalize companies that invest in Iran and Libya. At a briefing for reporters today, Daniel Tarullo, a top official of the National Economic Council, said that ""the President pushed back fairly hard,"" telling the allies that they needed to ""confront terrorist states to take action against countries that are threats to democracy and to the safety of our citizens."" Separately, a dispute flared over a plan pressed by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin to arrange for the International Monetary Fund to sell part of its $40 billion in gold reserves. The proceeds of a sale of $2 billion to $3 billion in gold would be invested in interest-generating financial instruments, and the resulting income would be used to pay off debt for third-world countries without requiring donor countries to allocate more resources to pay off the loans. The World Bank would pay off roughly $2 billion, and individual nations would forgive other debt as part of a larger initiative. After a lengthy struggle with countries opposed to the plan, led by Germany, the United States won wording in the economic communique that Mr. Rubin said would allow the gold sales to move forward after the I.M.F.'s annual meeting in the fall. ""We've all agreed that the I.M.F. should fund this primarily through its own resources, and we've all agreed to optimizing the assets of the I.M.F. to do so,"" Mr. Rubin said. But just before he spoke, the German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, insisted that the wording of the communique would allow the sale of gold to be blocked. Germany has steadfastly insisted that the gold reserves should be held for true emergencies. Further sparring broke out over Mr. Clinton's presentation about the halving of the Federal budget deficit and the creation of 9.7 million jobs by the American economy. President Jacques Chirac of France, where unemployment rates are running upward of twice the level of those in the United States, acknowledged that ""the U.S. has created a lot of jobs,"" but added, ""A lot are underpaid ones that we wouldn't find acceptable in Europe."" The leaders will meet again on Saturday, the last day of the conference. Mr. Clinton will then travel to Paris for dinner with Mr. Chirac, and later fly to Florida for a Sunday memorial service for those killed in the attack in Saudi Arabia."3-Jul-83,UNITED STATES (96%); AFRICA (96%); SOUTH AFRICA (94%); LIBYAN ARAB JAMAHIRIYA (93%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (92%); SOMALIA (79%); LIBERIA (79%); SUDAN (79%); CHAD (79%); ETHIOPIA (79%); KENYA (79%); ANGOLA (79%);   LIBYA (93%);,"The Reagan Administration, concerned about Soviet and Cuban involvement in Africa, has quietly doubled military aid to key countries in the region. Assistant Secretary of State Chester A. Crocker, head of the Bureau of African Affairs and the key American policy maker for the region, said military aid now represents about 20 percent of overall American aid to sub-Saharan African countries. The bulk of American aid, he said in an interview this week, is designed to alleviate the critical balance-of-payments deficits in most African countries, many of which are facing their worst economic crisis in 40 years. The crisis was fostered by drought, declining food production, rising birth rates and paltry foreign exchange earnings from such traditional export products as cocoa and rubber, the prices of which are depressed on the world market. Broader Pretoria Ties Sought Key pro-Western countries, such as the Sudan, Kenya, Somalia and Liberia, received the bulk of American aid.  At the same time, the Administration has made efforts to broaden ties with South Africa in what Administration officials acknowledge is a significant break from Carter Administration policies, which they describe as having had a ''civil rights tone'' shaped somewhat by Andrew Young, the former chief delegate to the United Nations. Administration officials acknowledge that they have been stung by strong domestic criticism of their policy, especially from blacks who say the United States is acting in complicity with South Africa. Administration officials said it was partly in an attempt to blunt such charges that Under Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the third-ranking official in the State Department, made a speech on June 24 criticizing the Pretoria Government. In the speech he characterized South Africa's official policy of racial discrimination as ''morally wrong.'' The Administration is actively lobbying against a bill sponsored by opponents of the Administration's Africa policies that is to come up in the House of Representatives in mid-July. It would bar the United States from voting in favor of a $1 billion International Monetary Fund loan to South Africa. In the interview, Mr. Crocker said there had been ''a kind of sterile discussion'' in the past about the poverty, hunger and corruption that afflict some African countries. ''We have made it clear that the reasons for Africa's economic malaise are, to put it mildly, not only the external recession and low commodity prices, but a whole generation of economic mismanagement,'' said Mr. Crocker. Administration officials say the Soviet Union, Cuba and Libya are working to destabilize several African nations. The Soviet Union, these officials say, provides 60 to 70 percent of the arms used in Africa. There are an estimated 30,000 Cuban troops and civilians in Angola, and 13,000 Cuban military personnel in Ethiopia. Libya Backs Chad Rebels Libya supports rebel forces in Chad, and Pentagon officials say the objective seems to be to put pressure on the Sudan and ultimately on southern Egypt. To counter such threats, the Administration has sharply increased military aid to African nations. In 1980 military aid to the nations of sub-Saharan Africa totaled $78 million, compared to an Administration request for $201 million in security assistance in 1984. Economic aid also climbed, but not as steeply: from $694 million to $965 million in the same period. In addition, the United States, according to Administration officials, has been supportive of such recently independent leftist regimes as that of Zimbabwe, to which economic aid tripled, from $24.7 million in 1980 to a proposed $75 million in 1984. Relations have been strengthened with the Marxist Government of Mozambique, with an exchange of ambassadors set to take place soon. By contrast, the socialist Government of President Julius K.  Nyerere of Tanzania, which has been plagued by unrest and economic disarray, has met chilly treatment from the Reagan Administration.  Economic aid to Tanzania fell from $28 million in 1980 to a proposed $14 million in 1984. Policy on Southern Africa Although groups such as the 20-member Congressional Black Caucus have criticized the ''militarization of our approach to African assistance,'' as its chairman, Representative Julian C. Dixon, Democrat of California, said recently, it is the issue of Administration policy in southern Africa that has stirred the sharpest verbal attacks. Administration policy to the region is based on what Mr. Crocker calls ''constructive engagement.'' This essentially means refraining from continuous public criticism of the Pretoria Government and seeking closer diplomatic ties with South Africa. It is based on the premise that the establishment of a more trusting American relationship with South Africa would spur it to undertake internal changes, halt its support and military harassment of nearby states and end its occupation of neighboring Namibia. Under the Reagan Administration, the United States has increased the number of military attaches in South Africa, provided visas to ranking South African military and intelligence personnel, permitted the sale of a computer that has a potential dual use for nuclearrelated equipment and loosened controls on some exports, including electric-shock batons, to the South African military and police. It also used its veto to block United Nations Security Council resolutions condemning South Africa and allowed American companies to broker nuclear fuel deliveries to South Africa although it refuses to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It is Namibia, also known as South-West Africa, that has dominated African policy in the last year."22-Apr-09,UNITED STATES (96%); CHINA (95%); SOMALIA (79%),"International But Favor Top Party The African National Congress, led by Jacob Zuma, is poised to win its fourth consecutive national election in a landslide, even as many South Africans are displeased with the way it has governed.

Mobutu Sese Seko said in an interview that Americans should instead focus on his Central African nation's ''true human rights drama'' - the burden of repaying the foreign debt. Mr. Mobutu, leader of one of Africa's most populous nations and a close ally of the Reagan Administration, said he came to the United States ''to say goodbye to President Reagan.'' In the capital this week, members of Congress are expected to question him about reported human rights abuses, and international bankers are expected to press him to maintain payments on Zaire's $7 billion foreign debt. ''It's an interference in Zaire's internal affairs,'' Mr. Mobutu said of a bill in the House of Representatives to end military aid and to condition further economic aid on improvements in Zaire's human rights situation. The measure, sponsored by Representative Ronald V. Dellums, Democrat of California, has 37 co-sponsors. The Zairian President seemed unperturbed about the threat to this year's American assistance, which consists of $3 million in military aid and $60 million in economic aid. ''I'm going to see 200 Congressmen - I have a good case,'' President Mobutu said. He was interviewed at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, where he was surrounded by his traditional totems of power: a leopard-skin hat and his carved walking stick. The African leader is also expected to discuss debt relief in talks scheduled with President Reagan and with officials of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. ''If we don't watch out, North-South relations are heading straight for catastrophe,'' Mr. Mobutu said, referring to difficulties that third-world countries encounter in servicing their foreign debts. From 1983 to 1986, he said, Zaire paid $2 billion, or half the money it receives from exports, for interest on its loans from foreign sources. In that period, he said, the country received $1 billion in new loans and investment. ''Zaire became a net exporter of capital,'' he said. ''When the poor give more to the rich, do you call that human rights?'' Critics of Mr. Mobutu, including Representative Dellums, have charged that corruption and mismanagement have undermined Zaire's ability to pay off the debt. Turning to other topics, Mr. Mobutu rejected accusations by Angolan officials that the Reagan Administration has used bases in southern Zaire to train and arm Angolan rebels. Asserting that Zaire was made a ''scapegoat'' for the spreading rebellion by the anti-Marxist National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, Mr. Mobutu repeated an earlier offer to open his largest base, Kamina, to permanent international inspection. Estimating that the rebels control one-third of Angola, Mr. Mobutu said that their arms in fact come from South-West Africa, the South African-administered territory also known as Namibia. The leader of the Angolan rebels, Jonas Savimbi, is expected to visit New York and Washington later this month."11-Sep-81,"UNITED STATES (96%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (95%); CENTRAL AFRICA (79%);","In Zaire the libation traditionally begins by pouring wine on the ground. Last night at the National Gallery of Art, Kaweta Milombe Sampassa, Zaire's minister of culture, altered that custom and suggested pouring the libation toast into ashtrays. As laughter etched the translations of his French directions, the 100 guests toasted Ronald Reagan's health, the rest of America, and the success of the first exhibition in America of Kongo funerary art. Though the exhibit opened two weeks ago, last night was the first time all its creators could schedule a party. ""The Four Moments of the Sun: Kongo Art in Two Worlds"" is a stunning collection of mannequins, grave markers and statues from the Mboma Kongo area and their functional and spiritual connections to American customs.. ""This establishes the Kongo as a major civilization of the whole goddamn planet. It will make it just as familiar as Britain,"" said the perpetually exuberant Robert Farris Thompson, the Yale scholar who helped organize the show. The idea was initiated by Frere Joseph Cornet, director of the national museum in Zaire, a diminutive man in a gray suit who whispered ""wonderful"" as he strolled past the images of rulers, mourners, executioners and healers. In both direct and indirect ways, the Zairian officials hope the small collection will improve the country's image. ""When people talk about our wealth, they think of raw materials -- our zinc, our cobalt and diamonds. We also think our art is a resource,"" said Sampassa. They also hope the cultural richness will help balance the often negative picture of Zairian economic mismanagement and political corruption. ""The government is making a big effort. We have a stabilization plan with the International Monetary Fund and our exports are increasing,"" said Zairian Ambassador Kasongo Mutuale. ""Where is there not corruption? We are making efforts with many things."" Among the American officials at the reception and sit-down dinner were Daniel Terra, ambassador-at-large for cultural affairs, Chester Crocker, assistant secretary of state for African Affairs, and Nicholas Murphy, director of the Office of Central African Affairs at the State Department. Crocker called Zaire ""one of our most important allies. We are seeking to strengthen those relationships. Zaire is a major player."" The Americans joined in a toast while the minister explained, and gallery director J. Carter Brown translated, that ""when one gives material goods to another, one loses; when one gives spiritual goods, one enriches oneself."""14-Dec-91,"UNITED STATES (97%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (94%); CENTRAL AFRICA (92%); ANGOLA (79%);","The Prime Minister of Zaire, Nguza Karl-i-Bond, ended a visit here today, saying he was convinced that the United States wants major political changes in the Central African nation that has been ruled for more than a quarter-century by President Mobutu Sese Seko. Mr. Nguza, a major Zairian diplomat and political figure off and on over the last two decades, said President Mobutu is aware that he cannot expect to cling to power much longer without the support of outside forces. ""He knows he is now at the end,"" Mr. Nguza said. ""He knows that all his friends in the West want him to step down."" In an interview, Mr. Nguza, who became Prime Minister in November, the third in three months, said that after months of political and economic chaos, the President fears only two things: ""bullets and being brought to court."" The Prime Minister has had a long, troubled relationship with the President. He served in his Cabinet and as an Ambassador, but also became the object of the Zairian leader's wrath, and was for a time under death sentence. He was incarcerated in President Mobutu's prisons. He acknowledges that friends often say his career ""has gone like a yo-yo."" Now, he says, the President knows him well. ""He knows I am not going to harm him,"" he said. ""He knows I would allow him to go in dignity."" The President is widely known for his lavish style of living and for corruption in his Government. Mr. Nguza said the President is apprehensive about being forced into exile. ""He knows what happened to the Shah,"" the Prime Minister said. ""He knows what happened to Marcos."" This week in Washington, Mr. Nguza asked the World Bank and International Monetary fund to send teams to run Zaire's central bank and tax system as a step toward reforming the economy. He said today that his request had been granted and that two Zairian officials would remain here to work out details. A Warning About Violence Mr. Nguza, who came to the United States a decade ago as an exile to seek, and be denied, backing against President Mobutu, returned to Zaire in 1985 and gradually reconciled himself with the President, a man Washington regarded as an ally against the leftist Government in Angola. Mr. Nguza served as Zaire's Ambassador in Washington from 1986 to 1988, and then Foreign Minister. He was Prime Minister briefly in 1980. He said that if President Mobutu is forced from office violently, the country will face civil war because all those who benefited from the President's rule will fight to retain their wealth and privileges. Poorly paid soldiers who went on looting rampages in September would be certain to join in the fray, he predicted. Mr. Nguza said that he hoped that Zaire could avoid the violent ""Liberian model"" of political change and instead follow the ""Zambian model."" In a multiparty election in October, Zambia's President, Kenneth D. Kaunda, accepted his loss at the polls and stepped down immediately, allowing a smooth transition of power to the winner, Frederick J. Chiluba."5-Jun-05,UNITED STATES (99%); AFRICA (96%); UNITED KINGDOM (94%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (92%); SCOTLAND (79%); FRANCE (79%),"A powerful consensus is building for a doubling of aid to Africa among the world's heavyweight donors, except the United States, a divide that is likely to come into sharp relief this week when Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain arrives in Washington to meet with President Bush. Mr. Blair, America's closest ally, hopes to shake loose more American aid for Africa. He is expected to ask Mr. Bush on Tuesday to join the leaders of other rich nations in forging a kind of Marshall Plan for Africa; Mr. Blair has called the continent's deepening poverty ''the fundamental moral challenge of our time.'' Britain is far from alone. The European Union has found its collective voice on global poverty, too. Its 25 member nations agreed unanimously on May 24 to almost double assistance to poor countries over the next five years. Japan this week reaffirmed its pledge to double aid to Africa in just three years. But when President Bush was asked this week about Mr. Blair's effort, as well as a British proposal to raise money for development on capital markets, he replied, ''It doesn't fit our budgetary process.'' The president hastened to add that he hoped to advance a ''compassion agenda'' when Mr. Blair plays host to leaders of the Group of 8 industrialized nations in Scotland next month, but any new Africa pact would certainly be weakened without American support. Underlying this debate are differences over Africa's readiness to absorb the additional $25 billion in aid Mr. Blair advocates. The Europeans favor a quick and bold surge in spending that officials in Paris and London say will make it possible for Africa to join the global economy. Their view is buttressed by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, Mr. Blair's Africa commission and a panel of experts appointed by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan. All have said that many African nations are improving governance, fighting corruption and growing economically, and could make good use of more aid. Bush administration officials say they, too, believe aid can help. They note that the United States has tripled aid to Africa to $3.2 billion since Mr. Bush took office, with initiatives to tackle AIDS and to assist well-governed countries. Financing for those programs will grow in coming years, they say. But the United States favors a more gradual buildup of aid, the officials said. It contends that the problem is less a lack of money than the ability of poor countries with weak institutions to spend it wisely. ''If you want to spend money well, it takes time,'' said an administration official who declined to be quoted by name. The administration has said that decades of extensive aid have failed to encourage economic growth. In 2002, Mr. Bush announced plans for a Millennium Challenge Account intended to change the way aid was given out, assisting only countries that controlled corruption, invested in health and education and encouraged trade and private investment. It was financed by Congress in 2004. So far, only eight African countries have been found eligible under its stringent standards and only one -- Madagascar -- has closed a deal for an aid package. More grants will be closed in coming months. Paul V. Applegarth, who heads the program, says its approach is in the intellectual forefront. But critics complain that the money is being spent too slowly and in amounts that are still too stingy. ''They're fighting wars for hundreds of billions of dollars and what they've done for Africa is start one program for AIDS,'' said Jeffrey D. Sachs, the Columbia University economist who led a United Nations-sponsored report on poverty. ''The Millennium Challenge Account hasn't disbursed a penny yet.'' The aid debate is likely to heat up between now and September, when world leaders assess progress toward goals they set in 2000, among them to halve extreme poverty. In the longer run, if Europe does rapidly accelerate aid, it will intensify a trend, more than a generation in the making, that has left European nations the world's dominant donors. While the United States is still the single largest donor, giving about a quarter of the total, it is next to last in the share of national income it gives -- 16 cents of each $100. On average, major European nations give more than twice as much -- 36 cents of each $100. And they plan to raise that level to 51 cents of $100 by 2010. In Europe, the issue of African poverty has greater traction than in the United States because of its historical links to Africa as colonial powers, the clout of nonprofit groups like Oxfam, and the proximity of Africa, which makes the prospect of African poverty and social breakdown a security threat. Alongside the British plan, France is advocating a levy on airline tickets, either as a tax or a voluntary contribution by passengers. Thierry Breton, the French finance minister, said in an interview in Paris that he had broached the idea with John W. Snow, the United States Treasury secretary. ''I said, 'John, maybe it's a good idea you join,''' he recalled. '''If you feel comfortable with it and want to do it on a voluntary basis, fine.''' But Tony Fratto, a Treasury spokesman, said the United States was not interested in either the British or the French proposals. ''We're happy to go to Congress and ask for money,'' he said. ''We don't need a scheme or an alternate way to increase funding for development.''

During the first visit by an Algerian head of state to Washington and the White House in 16 years, Bouteflika oversaw the signing of a trade and investment framework agreement with U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick, expressing both countries' willingness to ratchet up commercial ties. In an interview Saturday, Bouteflika said Algeria ranks second, after Saudi Arabia, for total U.S. investment in the Middle East and North Africa. The current figure is $ 3 billion, which Bouteflika projected would rise to $ 8 billion in a few years. The agreement sets up a consultative process on trade and investment that will lead to a bilateral investment treaty, reciprocal trade benefits and a double taxation agreement, and in effect opens up Algeria's lucrative oil and gas resources more broadly to foreign businesses. ""Our sense of Algeria is it is a country that needs to address socioeconomic problems,"" said a U.S. official who attended most of the meetings Bouteflika held at the White House and Blair House with American counterparts. ""They need to have an investment environment that is friendly to investors, and the U.S. will help out with technical assistance in areas they need to modernize."" Although he spoke of his wish to reconcile differences among Algerians, Bouteflika's passion for national accord -- as expressed when he took office in 1999 -- has been modified to what he described as ""the politics of the possible."" Asked if his government would move to legalize the Wafa party, the political heir to the banned Islamic Salvation Front, Bouteflika cautioned that he would not incorporate elements into the country's body politic that have resorted to violence. ""I have no prejudices, but cannot do more and I cannot go any further,"" he said, noting that some moderate Islamic political factions have been legalized. ""I don't spend my time giving authorizations [for new parties]; I spend my time extinguishing fires,"" he said in reference to spasms of bloodletting that continue to plague Algeria, along with eruptions of discontent. Betraying his delicate relationship with the army, he asked that the term ""military"" not be used in referring to the country's corrupt officials. ""All Algerians profit when they can,"" he said. U.S. officials did take up with Bouteflika complaints of human rights abuses and a recent defamation law limiting freedom of expression, a State Department official said, adding, ""If Algeria wants the U.S.-Algerian relationship to grow, he has to water his whole garden."" President Miguel Angel Rodriguez of Costa Rica said in an interview Friday he had urged President Bush to become a partner in the American Convention on Human Rights, and to increase U.S. contributions to the Organization of American States. ""Matters of principle are so important, in the same way that you plant a tree in the hope that your children will enjoy it,"" Rodriguez said, noting that Bush was very much ""for strengthening"" the OAS and ""interested"" in the human rights issue. The United States has yet to ratify the American Convention on Human Rights -- known as the Pact of San Jose, after the Costa Rican capital, where it was signed -- or agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The two leaders also discussed environmental issues. Rodriguez asked that Costa Rica be forgiven $ 54 million of its $ 200 million debt to the U.S. government. He said the sum would be put into a fund to generate interest and help maintain national parks and reserves to protect Costa Rica's biodiversity. Rodriguez also asked that a $ 100 million debt Costa Rica was going to forgive Nicaragua under an initiative for highly indebted poor countries be ""swapped"" for another $ 50 million San Jose owes to the United States. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have set up a special fund for developing creditor countries such as Costa Rica to help them shoulder such initiatives. Rodriguez met with Bush, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, national security adviser Condoleezza Rice, Zoellick and members of Congress to talk about trade, the Caribbean Basin Initiative and ""fast track"" trade authority. ""We found President Bush up to speed on all issues, focused and warm,"" said Ambassador Jaime Daremblum. Zlatko Lagumdzija left Sarajevo for Washington as foreign minister July 9, slipped at the airport and broke his elbow, then returned home last week with his arm in a sling and as the choice to become Bosnia's prime minister. At a dinner the next day hosted by Madeleine K. Albright, chairman of the National Democratic Institute and former secretary of state, Lagumdzija thanked her for ""her personal impact"" in giving the region a ""future that has a lot of sun, not so many shadows."" The worst place to live as a minority, according to a Newsweek article last week, is the Balkans, he said. ""That is what my political agenda is all about,"" he said. ""I want to live in a country where there is nothing bad about being a minority."""14-Apr-07,UNITED STATES (99%); IRAQ (93%); EUROPE (92%); AFRICA (92%); AFGHANISTAN (79%); PAKISTAN (79%),"When President Bush appointed Paul D. Wolfowitz as the president of the World Bank two years ago, the White House had to put down an insurrection among European nations that viewed the administration's best-known neoconservative as a symbol of American unilateralism and arrogance. For a while, Mr. Wolfowitz seemed to defuse those fears, even taking on the Bush administration over how best to aid the poorest nations of Africa. But now it is clear that the chorus of calls in recent days for Mr. Wolfowitz's ouster is only partly about his involvement in setting up a comfortable job, with a big pay raise, for a bank officer who is Mr. Wolfowitz's companion. At its core, the fight about whether Mr. Wolfowitz should stay on at the bank is a debate about Mr. Bush and his tumultuous relationship with the rest of the world, particularly the bank, the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which have viewed themselves -- at various moments since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 -- as being at war with the Bush White House and its agenda. As finance ministers gathered in Washington on Friday for the bank's weekend meeting, Mr. Wolfowitz worked behind the scenes, seeking support for keeping his job. But there were few endorsements of his leadership beyond those offered by the Bush administration. In foreign capitals, and among the bank's staff members, it has been noted that Mr. Wolfowitz's passion for fighting corruption, which he has said saps economic life from the world's poorest nations, seemed to evaporate when it came to reviewing lending to Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan, three countries that the United States considers strategically vital. Some longtime bank staff members complained that Mr. Wolfowitz relied too little on experts in international development and too much on a pair of aides who served with him in the administration. Members of the bank's board from around the world began comparing what they called the murky way in which the bank made some policy decisions to the secretive habits of the Bush administration. Nancy Birdsall, the president of the Center for Global Development, a group that monitors aid to the world's poorest nations, described what she termed ''real doubts about Wolfowitz's judgment'' inside the bank. Mr. Wolfowitz came to the bank with heavy political baggage. Since the bank was set up at the end of World War II, its president has always been an American, a fact that has engendered more and more resentment over time. That reaction was compounded when Mr. Bush selected Mr. Wolfowitz, who had served as deputy secretary of defense and an architect of the Iraq war. ''It took a huge amount of effort to quiet this down,'' a member of the bank's board of governors and an early supporter of Mr. Wolfowitz recalled Friday of the early insurrection. ''And you would think, knowing that he was going into an institution that was deeply suspicious of him and the Bush administration, that he would have done everything he could to allay those concerns.'' At first, Mr. Wolfowitz did so. He made Africa his first priority. He displayed a passion and energy for the work -- much as he did many years ago as ambassador to Indonesia, where he immersed himself in the culture and took on a dictator, Suharto. His campaign against corruption was intellectually unassailable and quintessentially American, and he was certainly right as far as the facts were concerned, members of the bank's staff and leadership say. But eventually his focus on that issue put him at odds with career officials at an institution that is famously resistant to outside influence, and which believes that fighting poverty has to come first, even if that means dealing with countries whose leaders are not above skimming a few million dollars along the way. ''He came in to a mood of skepticism and strong reservations by many,'' said Geoffrey Lamb, a former vice president of the bank, who worked closely with Mr. Wolfowitz on questions of finance for the world's poorest nations before he retired last summer. ''My feeling was that he provided a bit of reassurance, by moving actively on aid to Africa and debt forgiveness. Clearly, those early perceptions have changed a lot.'' Over time, Mr. Wolfowitz created an impression that at critical moments he was putting American foreign policy interests first, most notably when he suspended a program in Uzbekistan after the country denied landing rights to American military aircraft, and directed huge amounts of aid to the countries he once recruited to sign on to Washington's counterterrorism agenda. It did not help that he relied heavily on a pair of aides drawn from the Bush administration, Robin Cleveland and Kevin Kellems, who created an inner circle that the bank's professional staff members said they had great trouble piercing. Mr. Wolfowitz's defenders say that he was right to come in with a mission of shaking up the ingrown bureaucracy at the bank, and that the place desperately needed shaking up. But even they acknowledge that management has never been his strong suit, and that his judgment in dealing with the transfer of his companion, Shaha Ali Riza, was questionable. In the backlash against Mr. Wolfowitz, though, there is also an undercurrent of settling scores -- including those that go beyond the World Bank. Europeans still fume over Mr. Bush's decision to send John R. Bolton, one of the biggest critics of the United Nations, to New York to serve as ambassador there -- an experiment that ended when it became clear that the newly Democratic Senate would not confirm him to finish Mr. Bush's term. Others recall that the administration tried to fire Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, the Egyptian-born head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who famously declared in early 2003 that there was no evidence Saddam Hussein had reconstituted his nuclear weapons program. Dr. ElBaradei proved to be right, and was soon awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. So far, the White House has expressed confidence in Mr. Wolfowitz, but not with much vigor. There were no signs that President Bush was about to rush to his aid, though that could still happen. European and Asian officials bet it will not. ''There is a sense that we're finally at a moment when Bush needs the world more than the world needs Bush,'' said a senior foreign official who flew into Washington recently for the annual meeting of the bank and the International Monetary Fund. ''And there's more than a little of that mixed in this whole argument over Wolfowitz's fate.''"7-Jan-00,WESTERN AFRICA (94%); AFRICA (94%); COTE D'IVOIRE (94%); FRANCE (79%); LIBERIA (79%);,"The military coup that deposed civilian government in Ivory Coast for the first time in that country's history was predictable and, with concerted diplomatic activity, avoidable. As the final military coup of the 20th century, perhaps it will serve as a wakeup call to governments and international organizations that talk a great deal about preventive diplomacy but have done very little to practice it. The spark that precipitated the coup was a dispute over military pay. But the pent-up anger felt by military and civilian alike was directed at a corrupt government that had spent its way into bankruptcy. The government of Henri Konan Bedie had abused its power and, as it grew more and more insecure, did what other insecure governments do: blamed foreigners and opposition political figures for the problems it created and clamped down on dissent. There are a handful of countries in West Africa that have played a stabilizing role in the region over the past decade. Prior to 1995, Ivory Coast (Cote D'Ivoire) was one of them. Home to the African Development Bank and a leader of the ""entente"" nations and the ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) group, Ivory Coast under its longtime leader Felix Houphouet-Boigny was able to use its good offices, relatively strong economy and close relationship with France to play a constructive role when crises hit neighboring African states. Much of the negotiation to solve the Liberian crisis was done under the auspices of the Ivory Coast government. But in 1995, with Houphouet no longer around to be the arbiter of political power, Ivory Coast stability became a thing of the past. That year saw the country's two main opposition parties boycott the national election in a disagreement over the legal framework. The voter registration system and the administration of the electoral process have been in dispute ever since, and opposition leaders, most notably Alassane Dramane Ouattara, found themselves harassed, under arrest and banned from politics. Meanwhile, the economy began to reflect the internal instability. A combination of corruption, mismanagement and fleeing foreign capital placed Ivory Coast on an International Monetary Fund watch list. The country subsequently had its IMF loan canceled, and an already poor country became even poorer. Was the country ever placed on a diplomatic watch list? The warning signs could not have been more pronounced. Yet governments that knew well how important Ivory Coast was to West African stability seemed to adopt a business-as-usual stance. Meanwhile, the government's conduct, only rarely admonished by the West in public, thrust the country into a deeper crisis. Just a few weeks before the holidays, an international delegation sponsored by the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs visited Abidjan, the capital. In a departure statement, they referred to ""rising political tensions"" and called on the people of Ivory Coast to reconcile their differences to ensure a peaceful national election in 2000. As correct as it was, the statement could have been issued any time over the past five years. Two weeks later a rampaging military took over the government. The crisis-oriented diplomatic establishments of Western governments rarely act before the proverbial balloon goes up. In this case, perhaps the United States thought France had the situation under control. In fact, active collaboration between the two governments, involving the United Nations and ECOWAS, might have created sufficient pressure to bring about a political reconciliation and prevent a military takeover. This may be easy to suggest in retrospect, but I doubt you would find many officials of our goverment willing to testify under oath that they used all the tools available to fix this problem before it became a front-page issue. In fairness, many of these tools are difficult to use because of severe congressional budget cuts; it is difficult for the United States to keep up with the growing number of crises around the world. Unless we and other governments develop the capacity to practice preventive diplomacy, however, we will find ourselves overwhelmed and in a constant state of reaction, hand-wringing and debate over the use of military force--the only instrument of foreign policy for which adequate funding currently exists.

But many Africa experts and Zairians say the Administration's tentative embrace of Prime Minister Leon Kengo wa Dondo will do the opposite of what it intends: rehabilitate Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's dictator, whom the Administration has shunned in recent years because of his human-rights abuses and large-scale corruption. The Administration's Africa strategists say they are working to support Mr. Kengo so he can develop a power base independent of Mr. Mobutu. That would enable him to prepare Zaire for free elections and stabilize its out-of-control economy, which suffered inflation of more than 10,000 percent last year. To buttress Mr. Kengo, who some officials say is a sincere reformer, the Administration received him in Washington in early October, and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott visited Zaire two weeks ago. Mr. Talbott hinted that Washington would work to resume loans from the International Monetary Fund and would send a new Ambassador, after having withdrawn its Ambassador last year because of dismay with Mr. Mobutu. Critics of the Administration's policy say the strategy of backing Mr. Kengo and hinting at economic aid will strengthen Mr. Mobutu's hand because the longtime ruler can point to it as a sign of acceptance by Washington. These critics also argue that embracing Mr. Kengo is misguided because he is at worst a puppet of Mr. Mobutu and at best largely dependent on him. ""The United States is deceiving itself if it thinks Kengo is anything more than a puppet of Mobutu,"" Lambert Mende Omalanga, an opposition member in Parliament, said in an interview. ""He cannot do anything without Mobutu's go-ahead."" Before joining an opposition party, Mr. Kengo served as a Prime Minister under Mr. Mobutu from 1982 to 1985 and from 1988 to 1990. Like Mr. Mobutu, he has often been accused of human-rights abuses and of siphoning off Government funds. Critics of Washington's policy also fear that in pushing Mr. Kengo to prepare for elections, the Administration is paving the way toward legitimizing Mr. Mobutu, because many view him, thanks to his money and clout, as the likely winner. ""I think there is a rehabilitation of Mobutu going on,"" said Peter Rosenblum, an Africa expert with the International Human Rights Law Group, based in Washington. ""The Administration's view seems to be, he is an actor and we have to deal with him."" For most of Mr. Mobutu's 28 years in power, successive Administrations backed him as a helpful, strategically located client during the cold war. But with the collapse of Communism, the Administration has stopped supporting him. Nonetheless, State Department officials say they want to help pull the mineral-rich nation of 41 million back from the brink of political disintegration and economic disaster, fearing that it can spin out of control into a Rwanda-like civil war. In the three years before Mr. Kengo was elected last June, there was a political impasse in which Mr. Mobutu and Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi sought to block each move taken by the other. When a reconstituted Parliament elected Mr. Kengo last June, the United States -- joined by France and Belgium, two former colonial powers in central Africa -- saw an opportunity to push Zaire toward democracy and economic stability. The Administration lauds Mr. Kengo for allowing opposition leaders to debate Government officials on television, something Mr. Mobutu never permitted. They also praise him for seizing 30 tons of counterfeit currency that was flown into Zaire as part of a scheme that American officials say was intended to enrich Mr. Mobutu and his entourage. Some Administration officials acknowledge that they are not convinced that Mr. Kengo is independent of Mr. Mobutu. For example, Mr. Mobuto blocked the Prime Minister from replacing the head of Zaire's central bank. Still, diplomats say Mr. Kengo has gotten the Zairian President to give him some freedom by threatening to quit, something Mr. Mobutu apparently fears because it would bring him more international opprobrium. Under current law, the Administration is barred from providing aid to Zaire because it is behind in repaying its $800 million debt to the United States. The Administration is providing $12 million this year to relief organizations in Zaire."16-Feb-01,ZAMBIA (99%); AFRICA (92%); BAHAMAS (79%),"Several weeks before the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund granted debt relief to 22 poor nations in December, evidence began to surface that one nation, Zambia, had ""imprudent and irregular"" dealings in mineral sales that cost the African nation $60 million in lost revenues, according to a confidential auditor's report that detailed the losses. In 1998 and 1999, the draft report said, managers at the state-owned mining company had struck an exclusive contract with a Bahamas company for the sale of its cobalt.  The contract was struck more than a year before Zambia's copper mining and cobalt processing industries were sold to private, mainly South African, buyers. At prevailing market prices, the report said, sales of cobalt, often derived in copper and nickel mining and used to make alloys, cell-phone batteries and other products, should have earned $95 million for Zambia in 1998 and 1999. But, the report said, the national accounts showed an income of $30 million. ""The discrepancy highlights a serious cause for concern regarding the sales of cobalt metal during this period,"" the auditors stated. A draft copy of the report was obtained by The New York Times. Put more directly, the missing revenues were equal to two years of the debt relief offered a month after the report's completion by the World Bank and I.M.F . as part of a program to encourage sound financial management from extremely poor countries. Many of the debts date from the cold war era of superpower rivalry, when aid was used to build loyalty to the West. Faced with political and other pressures from Western governments and advocacy groups, the World Bank and I.M.F. decided last year to include Zambia in the list of countries to receive debt relief, according to officials with the two institutions. Because the mines were in private hands and the missing millions from cobalt sales were supposedly under investigation, World Bank and I.M.F. officials said, Zambia was committed to greater financial transparency. This weekend, James D. Wolfensohn, president of the bank, and Horst Kohler, managing director of the fund, plan to embark on an African tour to discuss the continent's economic malaise. But as the episode with Zambia's debt relief showed, the institutions confront politically charged issues that are far broader than those raised by protesters opposed to the two agencies' role in the global economy. On one hand, they are being pressed to give relief to the poorest nations. Before relief was extended, Zambia's debt amounted to $5 billion, more than five times its annual foreign exchange earnings. On the other hand, Western institutions have to avoid the allegation that by forgiving debts they are helping foster corruption and mismanaged economies. ""We operate as institutions in extremely hostile environments,"" an I.M.F. official said. ""There are always balances that are going to have to be struck in some fashion."" The Zambia case illustrated the judgments that entails. In June, at the prompting of the fund and the bank, Zambia committed itself to an independent investigation of cobalt sales. At that time, it had largely completed the privatization of state-owned copper mines that had been incurring huge losses even as they provided the country's sole source of foreign exchange and had come to be seen as a font of patronage. The inquiry was financed by the European Union, which paid for an accounting firm from Mauritius, De Chazal du Mee, to conduct it. In November, the firm produced its report on the dealings in 1998 and 1999 between the state-owned mining company, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, and a Bahamas company, the Metal Resources Group, or M.R.G. The history is murky because the auditors have not, by their admission, been able to interview Zambian managers or to see the full range of contracts. M.R.G. says it has not seen the draft report either. The auditors, Metal Resources said in a statement sent by e-mail, ""did their work without hearing our side of the story."" A spokesman for the company, Gavin Sanderson, said in a telephone interview: ""All the metal M.R.G. bought from Zambia was bought on normal commercial terms. We honored the contracts to the full, to the letter and the t. It would be a misconception that we had taken money from the Zambians and put it in our pockets."" But he added that the contracts ""exposed both sides to normal commercial risk."" According to a debt relief specialist at the World Bank, Tony Gaeta, the total relief offered to Zambia will reduce its overall debt, to $1.4 billion from $5.2 billion in 1999, and will save the country $30 million a year in the next 15 years, after it has repaid additional arrears falling due to the I.M.F. That would be dependent on continued efforts toward economic reform and accountability. ""The old paradigm was the superpower paradigm"" of aid and loans extended to nations in return for their loyalty to the West, an official at the fund said. But in the view of some fund officials the very fact that the Zambian authorities have publicly commissioned an audit -- however incomplete -- and pledged a full investigation of the cobalt sales highlighted an important shift in attitudes. What the Zambian report had shown, the official said, was that ""there's a realization under way here, a trend that these governments understand that the old paradigm doesn't work anymore."""29-Sep-06,ZAMBIA (99%); CHINA (79%); AFRICA (79%),"Zambian officials began tallying ballots early Friday after a huge turnout in close elections fought on a debate over President Levy Mwanawasa's economic policies. International donors had praised his actions, but the opposition denounced them for failing to lift millions out of poverty. Mwanawasa urged voters to back his record of strict financial discipline and zero tolerance of corruption, policies that have earned Zambia relief from debts and commendation from the International Monetary Fund and other donors. His populist challenger, Michael Sata, accused the incumbent of ""selling out"" Zambia to donors and foreign firms, particularly from China, who are interested in the country's huge copper reserves. Different opinion polls have tipped both Mwanawasa and Sata to win, meaning Thursday's vote could be the closest in the southern Africa country since it won independence from Britain in 1964. Analysts said the count would be watched closely by voters, who are divided over the competing visions of Zambia's future advanced by the two main candidates. Frequent and at times obvious voter fraud has marred previous elections. Election officials said the vote this year was nearly flawless, except for a few instances, criticized by Sata's Patriotic Front, in which voters were erroneously omitted from registers. A third candidate in the presidential race, Hakainde Hichilema of the United Democratic Alliance, is expected to come in third, despite an endorsement by liberation hero and former president Kenneth Kaunda as the ""best man to lead Zambia."" After the 2001 election, the opposition petitioned the Supreme Court to nullify Mwanawasa's victory, saying the vote was rigged, but the court dismissed the accusations. Zambia's electoral commission introduced measures to try to ensure free and fair elections this time, including satellite technology to transmit poll results and the use of transparent ballot boxes. It is unclear when the winner will be declared. Under a new electoral law, the news media are forbidden to project a winner based on partial results, although poll watchers expect the final count by Saturday or Sunday. Mwanawasa, a burly lawyer who made an early mark with an anti-corruption drive targeting former president Frederick Chiluba, has sought to highlight an economic record that, in addition to winning debt relief, has cut poverty and pushed economic growth above 5 percent. He has repeatedly called the election a referendum on Zambia's economic future. Sata has won support by promising workers a bigger stake in state enterprises, major tax cuts and a 51 percent cap on foreign mine ownership. His rallies have been packed with supporters who say the Mwanawasa team has failed to bring the benefits of Zambia's economic revitalization to the estimated two-thirds of Zambia's 11.5 million people who still live on less than $1 a day."16-Jun-03,ZIMBABWE (94%); SOUTH AFRICA (93%); FRANCE (92%); UNITED STATES (92%); AFRICA (92%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (90%),"AS THE DEBATE continues over the ouster of Saddam Hussein, several countries in Africa are offering further tests of the tenet that dictators deserve to be left alone so long as they brutalize only their own citizens. The starkest example may be Zimbabwe, where a corrupt, criminal, 79-year-old man, Robert Mugabe, has dragged a once-promising land into a nightmare of violence, famine and disease. Once a revered fighter for majority black rule in his country, Mr. Mugabe never really tolerated his democratic opposition. But since losing a referendum on a new constitution three years ago, he has chosen to systematically destroy his own country rather than yield to opponents. Last year he blatantly stole a presidential election and drove the most productive farmers off their land. Now he presides over a nation where millions are at risk of starvation, where AIDS ravages the countryside, where once-rich farms lie fallow and once-bustling markets are bare. His regime has been ousted from the British Commonwealth, sanctioned by the European Union and United States, suspended from the International Monetary Fund. Yet still he hangs on to power. His formula is simple: brute force by the coterie of corrupt thugs in the army and security forces who still have a stake in his survival. This month, for the third month in a row, a large part of Zimbabwe's workforce stayed home in a protest strike, closing up to 90 percent of businesses in the cities. But an attempt by the opposition to stage a climactic protest in the streets of the capital, Harare, was stifled by a flood of armed men, who beat and arrested hundreds. Among those swept up was Morgan Tsvangirai, head of the Movement for Democratic Change and the man who probably won last year's presidential election. Last week one of Mr. Mugabe's courts extended his detention for a month; he and his top deputy already face trial for treason on the ludicrous charge of attempting to murder the president. Mr. Mugabe's ability to get away with criminality that threatens the lives of millions is mostly due to his location. Neither the Bush administration nor any other Western power has been willing to take more than token action against him. Despite an official ban on travel by Mr. Mugabe to the European Union, French President Jacques Chirac recently invited him to a summit meeting in Paris. The single largest hope for Zimbabweans lies with their neighbor South Africa, which supplies 15 percent of the country's electricity. South African President Thabo Mbeki has tried to talk Mr. Mugabe into negotiating with his opposition or holding honest elections, with no success. Now Zimbabwean exiles and human rights groups are urging South Africa to cut off their country's power. Mr. Mugabe has already proven that he prefers to scorch his own earth rather than give in, but a power cut may peel away enough of his supporters to make a regime change possible. Mr. Mbeki should try that approach."16-Aug-01,ZIMBABWE (94%); UNITED STATES (92%); KENYA (92%); AFRICA (92%); AUSTRIA (79%),"HARARE, Zimbabwe -- The editor of Zimbabwe's only independent daily newspaper and three colleagues were in police custody yesterday over a report alleging police vehicles were used during a wave of looting of white-owned farms.

Reuters NAIROBI -- The International Monetary Fund announced that lending to Kenya would remain suspended after the country's parliament rejected a key piece of anti-corruption legislation. Business leaders said the decision would rip a $ 300 million hole in the government's budget and plunge the country's economy deeper into crisis. The government says it still hopes to persuade the IMF to restore lending, but diplomats said the government instead needed to persuade opposition parties to pass some kind of modified legislation. Opposition leader Mwai Kibaki, of the Democratic Party, said the government proposal was full of discrepancies and fell short of what would be necessary to fight corruption. Parliament voted 130 to 82 Tuesday for a bill paving the way for the establishment of a body to fight official corruption, a key piece of legislation demanded by the IMF as a condition for releasing suspended loans. However, the support fell short of the 145 votes needed to pass the constitutional amendment. ReutersEUROPE VIENNA -- A day after her release from an Italian prison, an American jailed for three weeks after the Group of Eight summit in Genoa said she would fight for the release of other ""political prisoners."" Susanna Thomas, 21, a Quaker from New Jersey, said her time in prison had brought her closer to others arrested in connection with the protests at the summit last month. ""We shared a toothbrush. We shared soap, chocolate, cigarettes and all the little things that make life pleasurable. And most of all,"" she said, ""we shared support."" Thomas was among 20 people ordered released by a Genoa court Tuesday. The group was made up of 15 Austrians, three Americans, a Slovak and a Swede. Several others are still detained, including at least 10 Germans accused of being members of the anarchist Black Bloc group. Arriving at Vienna's airport from Milan, Thomas promised to do all she could to support the other detainees. She still faces charges that could lead to a 15-year prison sentence. ""The story is still going on,"" she said. ""All the Genoese political prisoners need help and support and solidarity."" Associated Press LOURDES, France -- A Spanish man packed his car with explosives and set it on fire after ramming through the entrance to the Lourdes Sanctuary, where 40,000 people were attending Mass, officials said. No one was injured in the attack, which occurred during a ceremony to mark the Assumption Day holiday. After the man, described as a local resident in his seventies, bashed through one of the portals of the Lourdes complex in southwest France, he stopped his car and set it on fire. LCI television quoted a witness as saying that the man doused his car seats with gasoline and lit the fire while still inside the vehicle. Security guards immediately pulled the man from the car and extinguished the flames, state prosecutor Yves Saint-Macary said. The car was loaded with Molotov cocktails, gas canisters, bags of nails, a loaded rifle and hundreds of cartridges, officials said. The man told authorities he was trying to commit suicide and had no religious or political motive, Saint-Macary said.

President Robert Mugabe's corrupt government has led to inflation, high unemployment and shortages of food and fuel. Mr. Mugabe has long been known for his contradictions. In the 1970's he preached Marxism to intellectuals, while encouraging Shona rituals to win over the rural masses. Today he is blaming the white farming minority for Zimbabwe's turmoil. Before the International Monetary Fund and the West try to bail out the country, Mr. Mugabe and his cronies should eliminate the corruption that has hurt the suffering population of Zimbabwe. LEON HODES Great Neck, N.Y., April 23, 2000 http://www.nytimes.com"21-Nov-99,ZIMBABWE (97%); UNITED KINGDOM (92%); SOUTHERN AFRICA (79%);,"What ultimately got to Lincoln Shenge was not the meager pay or the long hours that he puts in at this city's main hospital. It wasn't the constant shortages of even the most basic medical supplies: soap, clean towels, surgical gloves. The young doctors managed that well enough, and Shenge even learned how to make do without painkillers, warning patients on the operating table that they ""would just have to be brave."" In the end, Shenge and the other 600 doctors went on strike because none of them could bear to lose another patient needlessly while the government spends at least $ 3 million a month to fight a war in neighboring Congo that hardly anyone here seems to want. ""The doctors, we can't even afford a car,"" said Shenge, 23. ""When I get paged by the hospital for an emergency call, I have to flag down a [bus] and just hope and pray that there's no other passengers on board who have to be dropped off ahead of me. We've all lost patients that way. Our government has got to get its priorities straight."" With inflation soaring, a quarter of its 12 million people infected with AIDS and two-thirds living in poverty, Zimbabwe's widespread suffering represents this country's greatest test of faith since a civil war wrenched it from British rule 19 years ago. Never before has this southern African country so publicly questioned the autocratic leadership of its founding father, President Robert Mugabe, whose rebel militia toppled the British colony known as Rhodesia. A coalition of labor unions, churches and civic groups have formed the country's first opposition party, which is challenging Mugabe's governing party, Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, in next year's parliamentary elections. A grass roots effort to rewrite the constitution that gives Mugabe unchecked authority has led to a national outpouring of political grievances, gathering so much momentum that government officials have tried to co-opt the process. And the emergence of a critical, independent press allows no misstep to go unnoticed, reinforcing almost daily the popular image of the government as a corrupt ruling elite, whose indifference to ordinary citizens is a betrayal of the independence movement that earned Zimbabwe the world's admiration more than two decades ago. ""The economic and social crisis is so unprecedented that everyone realizes we need a change, but every time we talk about the future, they bring up the past,"" said Morgan Tsvangirai, a labor unionist who heads the Movement for Democratic Change, the newly formed opposition party. ""They've remained arrogant, locked in a time warp, unwilling to hear dissent, unable to come up with new ideas, unaccountable for their corruption and failings. We need a new vision. The liberator has become a liability."" Dissatisfaction with Mugabe is not new. Periodic uprisings in the form of labor strikes, student protests and even small-scale riots have been part of Zimbabwe's civic culture for several years. But Mugabe's decision more than a year ago to send 10,000 troops to Congo to help defend President Laurent Kabila's autocratic government from foreign-backed rebel forces has hardened attitudes and formed the first droplets of a revolution. Despite Mugabe's contention that the military commitment is necessary to defend a neighbor and investment partner from aggressors who could further destabilize southern Africa, very few believe that Zimbabwe can afford the war. In a nationwide survey last year, 70 percent of respondents said they opposed the country's military involvement in Congo. The government's proposal last month to introduce an ""AIDS tax"" on all payroll costs has been condemned by business, labor and civic organizations who say that no additional levy would be necessary were it not for the 58 percent increase in the Defense Ministry's budget. ""Why bother putting out a fire next door,"" said Andrew Mutandwa, a former Mugabe spokesman who now works for an AIDS awareness group, ""when your own house is on fire."" Said John Makumbe, a University of Zimbabwe political science professor last month, ""The Congo is a big rock that Mugabe has tied to the country. It's heavy and bound to take many down."" The fissures in Zimbabwe represent Africa's maturing efforts to find its own way in the generation following the liberation of most of the continent from its European rulers. The emergent states, scholars and diplomats say, have essentially mapped out three different roads leading toward a post-colonial world, with nations like South Africa, Nigeria and Mozambique moving toward economic growth and democracy. But states like Congo and Angola are plunging deeper into catastrophic civil wars and economic ruin, and other nations, like Zimbabwe, seem stalled by poor governance and undeveloped democracies. ""Leaders run out of ideas and legitimacy but hang on nonetheless, taking repressive measures to compensate for those two necessary but fading virtues,"" said William Zartman, a professor of international relations at Johns Hopkins University. ""Mugabe is by now a rotten gift to his country, yet there is no legal and practicable way to retire him. The lesson is again one in full support of democracy. Democracy does not guarantee good results, but it does guarantee the removal of bad ones."" Mugabe's office did not return a reporter's phone calls, but Mugabe has told reporters previously that requirements of international donors, particularly the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, are largely responsible for the expansion of poverty in Zimbabwe. And he has resisted all suggestions that his time has passed. ""I know the door through which I came into politics,"" the 75-year-old Mugabe said earlier this year, ""and I know the door I should use to get out of politics."" Mugabe's installation of free-market reforms over the past eight years has appeased international donors but done little else. Undermined by an increasingly competitive business climate, halting efforts to privatize state enterprises and crumbling infrastructure, Zimbabwe has lost almost 40 percent of its manufacturing sector over the past decade. And since the currency collapsed two years ago, prices for food, fuel and other goods have risen by almost 70 percent, a record high. Wages have failed to keep pace, triggering a series of strikes by public-sector employees. When the doctors ended their six-week strike earlier this month, in return for government assurances that their salaries would be reviewed and the national health budget raised, 9,000 nurses walked out. They have since returned to work. But it is not so much that things seem to be going so badly. Rather, it is that many people here don't believe that the government is even trying to improve conditions. Only public outrage stopped Mugabe's cabinet members this fall from approving a 182 percent raise for themselves. And Mugabe's lavish homes, tailored suits and frequent travels have begun to grate on his constituents' nerves. ""The week that the hospitals shut down because all the doctors went on strike, there were pictures on television of Mugabe attending a wedding in Malawi,"" said Mutandwa. ""People are asking: 'Does anyone even care what's happening to us?' "" Any such criticism would have seemed heretical a decade ago. Following Zimbabwe's independence, Mugabe's newly formed government embarked on an ambitious effort to strengthen health and education for indigenous Africans whose welfare had been ignored by the colonial government. His socialist health care and education policies made Zimbabwe's public hospitals and schools among the continent's best. But many of those gains have been reversed in recent years as funding for health and education has been slashed, in part to comply with donors' requirements for financial aid. ""Mugabe is like a silent movie star, said one Western diplomat. ""He was good in his day. But we've got the talkies now.""

The opposition's candidate rejected the results, saying the vote was rigged. In Washington, President Bush said the United States did not ""recognize the outcome of the election because we think it's flawed."" Speaking at a White House news conference, Bush said: ""We are dealing with our friends to figure out how to deal with this flawed election."" Unofficial results showed the 78-year-old Mugabe winning a fourth presidential term in a landslide over Morgan Tsvangirai, a former labor organizer and leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). With about 3.1 million of the nation's 5.6 million registered voters casting ballots, officials said, Mugabe won more than 1.6 million votes to Tsvangirai's 1.2 million. Several preelection polls had showed Mugabe trailing Tsvangirai, and the announcement today of the president's wide margin of victory drew prompt accusations of fraud from the opposition. ""The Movement for Democratic Change is firmly of the view that the election results do not reflect the true will of the people of Zimbabwe and are consequently illegitimate in the eyes of the people,"" Tsvangirai told reporters here today. ""We therefore do not accept them."" Likewise, several election monitoring groups cast doubt on the validity of the vote, describing an electoral process disfigured by violence, intimidation, mass arrests and last-minute changes to election laws and logistics that effectively disenfranchised tens of thousands of voters. Monitors from a handful of African nations, however, declared the election free and fair. As the results were announced, Zimbabwe's army was put on ""full alert"" and deployed in urban centers, where the MDC draws its core support, to address any civil unrest. Sporadic skirmishes between supporters of the two candidates erupted throughout the day here in Harare, the capital, but none resulted in any serious injuries. The election was widely regarded as the continent's most pivotal since South Africans of all races went to the polls eight years ago, ending decades of oppressive white-minority rule. Mugabe and his supporters here and abroad described the election as a question of whether Africans would retain political power in Zimbabwe or hand it over to whites from the West -- who were among the supporters of Tsvangirai's candidacy -- a generation after the end of colonial rule. David Nyekorach-Matsanga, a supporter of Mugabe's ruling party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), today called Mugabe's victory a triumph against the forces of colonialism and imperialism. ""The MDC represents the white man in the United States and in Britain,"" he said. ""I say that only Americans should decide the future of their country; only the British should decide the future of Britain. Well, I am Zimbabwean, and only Zimbabweans should decide the future of this country."" But the MDC's African and white supporters called the issues of race and colonial rule a smoke screen for Mugabe and his party's misrule, corruption and mishandling of the economy since leading Zimbabwe to independence in 1980. Instead, they argued that this election revolved around the issues of good governance and whether Africans were willing to let go of the colonial past and move toward multiparty democracy and economic growth through global trade. Tsvangirai said today that the ZANU-PF manipulated the results through a two-year campaign of violence in which opposition supporters were beaten and killed by mobs led by veterans from the country's independence war and young militants recruited by the party. MDC politicians were unable to campaign in some areas because of widespread violence, poll workers were abducted during the three-day election period, and a reduction in the number of polling stations in MDC strongholds prevented nearly 360,000 voters from casting ballots before voting ended Monday evening, he said. ""This was done through state-sponsored terrorism conducted by ZANU-PF militia, rogue elements in the war veterans, ZANU-PF youths and, in some instances, with the active or passive connivance of the police,"" Tsvangirai said. Government officials contend that the state played no role in the violence that led to more than 100 deaths over the past two years and that the MDC was responsible for most of the attacks, not ZANU-PF. ""These elections were held in a free and fair manner,"" said Emmerson Mnangagwa, a senior ZANU-PF lawmaker and parliamentary speaker who explained the shift in polling places from urban centers to rural areas that typically support ZANU-PF as intended to expand access to voters in the countryside. Mugabe, a leader of guerrilla forces in the independence struggle in what was then white-ruled Rhodesia, was one of Africa's most celebrated heroes when voters chose him to head the country in 1980. A former Marxist who reluctantly adopted free-market reforms after the Cold War, Mugabe oversaw free health and educational systems that were once regarded as the jewels of Africa, making Zimbabweans the continent's most literate population. But Mugabe's deployment of troops to Congo in 1998 to fight an unpopular civil war and his land-reform program, in which the country's most fertile farmland was seized from prosperous whites and redistributed to poor, landless blacks, prompted the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and a host of donor countries to cut off much of their aid to Zimbabwe. As a result, unemployment here has reached 60 percent, the inflation rate was 112 percent last year and, according to the U.N. World Health Organization, food shortages threaten a half-million Zimbabweans with starvation. Western governments that once enthusiastically supported Mugabe joined the Southern African Development Community (SADC) today in condemning the violence, the election law revisions and many other problems, saying the election fell short of democratic standards. ""The climate of insecurity . . . was such that the electoral process could not be said to adequately comply with the norms and standards for elections in the SADC region,"" said Duke Lefhoko, head of the SADC's Parliamentary Forum observer mission. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said the vote did not reflect the will of the people. ""As a result, Mr. Mugabe may claim victory, but not democratic legitimacy,"" Powell said in a statement. Observers from South Africa, Namibia and Nigeria acknowledged today that violence occurred during the campaign, but endorsed the election as legitimate, dismissing allegations of harassment and intimidation by the state as one-sided and exaggerated. South African observers described the reduction of polling stations in urban areas as an ""administrative oversight."" An Organization of African Unity observer team said that ""in general the elections were transparent, credible, free and fair."" On the streets of Harare today, truckloads of ZANU-PF supporters danced and cheered their party's victory, but more people here seemed frustrated and disbelieving. ""The old man has stolen the election,"" said David Ndlovu, a taxi driver. ""Our economy is already biting into our flesh. We are about to feel what it's like when the economy bites into the bone. I fear that my country will become a pariah state like apartheid South Africa, and where will the jobs come from then?"" Waving a ZANU-PF flag and laughing almost uncontrollably, Mutuma Mawere, a local businessman, said that the MDC and its supporters had miscalculated the will of Zimbabweans who did not trust a party they saw as a proxy for Western interests. ""Democracy is sweet,"" Mawere said, ""and it is sour."""15-Mar-02,ZIMBABWE (98%); AFRICA (93%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%); NIGERIA (79%); SOUTHERN AFRICA (70%),"Leaning listlessly on the wall of a roadside gas station today, Sydney Gumbo and Nathan Mzumara tried to come to grips with the reelection of President Robert Mugabe. ""It's like being robbed,"" said Gumbo, 26, as he took one last drag from his cigarette. ""It's like being robbed in your own home,"" said Mzumara, 29. ""In broad daylight,"" said Gumbo. ""And being dragged outside and beaten,"" said Mzumara. ""With all your neighbors watching,"" said Gumbo. ""But when the police come, your neighbors say that you are to blame, not the man who has robbed and beaten you,"" said Mzumara. Gumbo nodded in agreement, the analogy complete. The two men were giving voice to a gut reaction widely shared in Zimbabwe one day after election officials announced that voters had overwhelmingly returned Mugabe, 78, to office for a fourth term. After a campaign characterized by state-sponsored violence and intimidation, and after preelection polls showed Mugabe trailing his opponent, many Zimbabweans -- and many Western governments and monitoring groups -- felt the way Gumbo and Mzumara did. Many of this country's neighbors in southern Africa, however, did not. ""It's just hard to believe,"" said Mzumara, tossing his cigarette into the dirt and stomping it as if in disgust, ""that the old man can just steal an election and all of Africa acts as if everything is okay. Why? Because he is an African hero from a war that was won a long time ago. Are the people in this country suffering because of him not Africans, too?"" In this town outside Harare -- Zimbabwe's capital and a stronghold of the losing opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) -- disbelief seems more prevalent than anger, lessening fears that Zimbabweans might revolt at the declaration of Mugabe as the winner of the country's most bitterly fought election since its independence from British rule in 1980. ""It is not just that they are like bandits, stealing an election from the people,"" said Justine Mafundikwa, a seamstress. ""But they rigged the vote so that it wasn't even close. ""They turned what should have been a landslide for [the MDC's presidential candidate Morgan] Tsvangirai into a landslide for Mugabe,"" she said of the announced results, which showed the incumbent winning by more than 400,000 votes. Election monitors from the Commonwealth nations today joined Western observers in denouncing the elections as deeply flawed. While the MDC and Mugabe's party were involved in political violence, said Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, the former military ruler of Nigeria who headed the Commonwealth observers here, ""it is our view that most of these were perpetrated by members/supporters of the ruling party against members/supporters of the opposition."" Abubakar also criticized the police for standing idly by when MDC members were being attacked but being ""high-handed"" when dealing with MDC supporters suspected of wrongdoing. The stark contrast between assessments by the Commonwealth and by many African observers -- Namibia, for example, said that procedures were so ""watertight"" as to make rigging impossible -- directed some voters' anger not just at Mugabe but also at the neighboring countries. ""What elections did they observe?"" Mafundikwa said testily. ""Are they blind? In the name of solidarity with their African brother Mugabe, they betray the rest of us who are hungry and without jobs and without money to even feed our children?"" Following a visit with Mugabe today, South African Deputy President Jacob Zuma told reporters that the elections were free and fair and that Mugabe should be recognized as the country's legitimate leader. A spokesman for President Thabo Mbeki said, however, that Mbeki was still contemplating his assessment. Farther afield, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi praised Mugabe's victory, and Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa said in a letter of congratulations that Mugabe's ""firmness was good for all of Africa."" President Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said today that such endorsements were troubling. ""From the president's point of view,"" he said, ""arguments that elections were flawed [but] are still acceptable send a negative signal to the rest of the world about African states' commitment to the rule of law and democracy."" In London, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said Britain would deny its former colony access to international funds. Economists and Western diplomats said Mugabe's reelection makes it likely that Zimbabwe's economic deterioration would continue.  Institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have already severed ties with the country. During the past two years, Mugabe has portrayed Tsvangirai as a puppet of the British and of whites eager to seize control of Zimbabwe after 22 years of black-majority rule. The rallying cry resonated with many of the country's neighbors, which also fought costly wars against colonial rule. But on the streets of Harare today, few seemed concerned with the threat of losing their sovereignty to whites. ""We won that war against the white settlers years ago,"" Gumbo said. ""It was Zimbabweans, South African, Nigerians, Namibians, our own black brothers who sold us out this time."""7-Jun-04,ZIMBABWE (99%),"Like scores of opposition politicians in Zimbabwe, David Mpala knew violence firsthand. As he campaigned for this region's seat in Parliament in 2000, 40 government supporters clubbed him so soundly that he was permanently scarred. In 2002, 18 thugs dragged him into the bush, beat him and stabbed him in the back. Mr. Mpala, 48, died in February, and the government held an election last month to fill his seat. This time, government critics say, it was democracy that got mugged. In what many here see as a dry run for Zimbabwe's national elections next March, President Robert G. Mugabe's party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Popular Front, known as ZANU-PF, went to extraordinary lengths three weeks ago to guarantee a win in Lupane. Independent election observers, journalists and opposition politicians reported a government campaign of beatings, arrests, bribery, fraud and intimidation in April and May, intended, they say, to keep supporters of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change away from the polls and to press citizens to vote for Mr. Mugabe's party. Lupane district has long reviled Mr. Mugabe's government, in part because his troops killed thousands of the local Ndebele people 25 years ago as his party consolidated its grip on Zimbabwe. But when vote-tallying ended on May 17, the governing party's candidate had collected 10,069 votes; the Movement for Democratic Change candidate, 9,186. ''What I'm experiencing now is hopelessness,'' Morgan Komichi, 40, chief of the Movement's operations in Matebeleland North Province, which includes Lupane, said in an interview. ''ZANU-PF has been building a dictatorship for a long time.'' Mr. Komichi speaks from experience. He has been arrested six times, most recently on May 11 while he was coordinating the opposition's parliamentary campaign in Lupane. He said he spent two days in a jail cell with 23 other opposition figures before being released without explanation. Mr. Mugabe's government is not known for indulging its critics. But with parliamentary elections on the horizon -- crucial because they are almost certainly the last of his 24 years as Zimbabwe's autocrat -- a new campaign of repression appears to be gaining momentum. Its goal is to neutralize any outside force that might sway the choice of his successor, in part by casting black Zimbabwe as the target of forces bent on its destruction. ZANU-PF won a majority of seats in Parliament in the last national election, in 2002. But most independent observers said that the balloting was rigged and that the Movement for Democratic Change, the only opposition party, would have won a fair election. In recent weeks, the government has closed one of the nation's few remaining independent newspapers and has labeled foreign journalists as terrorists. It has stepped up harassment of opposition politicians and civil-society leaders. Last month, the human-rights group Amnesty International cited four separate instances of beatings and detentions of activists in one week in late April. Last month, the government expelled United Nations experts who were assessing the national corn harvest, widely judged to have been a failure for the third straight year. It proposed to censor all e-mail for anti-state provocations, and shut down private schools it has called racist white preserves. Iden Wetherell, the white editor of the weekly Zimbabwe Independent, said he and his newspaper had received vague threats of government retaliation in recent weeks for their criticism of official policy. ''There's no doubt in my mind that Mugabe is preparing his party, leading his party into a quite serious offensive against the opposition and civil society which is designed to bring about total victory in 2005,'' he said by telephone from Harare, the capital. ''If you look at the pattern of things since the 2000 referendum,'' he said, ''you will see that this country is constantly being taken to the brink of anarchy as a political strategy to motivate the ruling party's supporters, to suggest a serious threat to the country; that the opposition is in league with external forces to bring down the regime.'' Lovemore Madhuku, a lawyer who heads the National Constitutional Assembly, was among 80 people arrested on May 15 in Gweru, in central Zimbabwe, as the organization -- an amalgam of human rights, political, religious and student groups -- sought to hold a meeting on constitutional reform. Police officers fired tear gas and beat conferees with nightsticks to break up the meeting, which they said was illegal. ''In the last one or two months, we've seen continuing evidence of the grip of this regime on power,'' Mr. Madhuku said in a telephone interview from Harare. ''The regime here is closing, completely closing, all avenues of people expressing themselves.'' In recent months, Mr. Mugabe has increasingly lashed out at real and potential critics. The United States and Britain, which have imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe in reaction to its human-rights record, have been frequent targets, as have global institutions. Last month, Mr. Mugabe denounced the International Monetary Fund, to which Zimbabwe is in arrears on $290 million in loans, as ''awful'' and untrustworthy. Although the United Nations estimated this year that two-thirds of Zimbabweans had no ready access to food -- the worst record in Africa -- Mr. Mugabe has proclaimed the nation self-sufficient. Analysts have estimated that this year's corn harvest would total from 700,000 to one million tons -- half the nation's needs. But Zimbabwe officials insist that the corn harvest will total 2.4 million tons, the largest in decades. ''We are not hungry,'' Mr. Mugabe said in an interview with Sky Television, the British network, last month. ''Why foist this food upon us? We don't want to be choked. We have enough.'' Some human rights monitors, like Amnesty International, have said they believe that Zimbabwe's refusal of further international aid is a prelude to the use of food as a bargaining tool to win support for the governing party in the elections next year. Last month's events in Lupane district hardly dispel that notion. Mr. Komichi said that as voters lined up on May 15 at the Lupane Business Center, the ramshackle commercial hub in Lupane village, they were greeted by stacked sacks of corn and government supporters handing out coupons to potential supporters. He and others say the Lupane election was marred by official fraud and manipulation. Starting in late March, the government bused in members of its feared Green Bombers youth militia to register as voters. The militia members were then dispersed throughout the province to wage a strong-arm campaign to get out the vote for the government candidate. As part of a nationwide campaign to build local support, the government has awarded the nation's influential traditional elders monthly salaries of 1.5 million Zimbabwean dollars -- about $450 at current rates -- and Mazda pickup trucks. The independent Zimbabwe Election Support Network reported that the elders and their subordinates, who control patronage and property in most villages, stood vigil at Lupane polling places last month, ostentatiously ticking off the names of villagers who arrived to vote. ''They're threatened by a simple thing: 'If you don't vote ZANU-PF, we will know it,''' Mr. Komichi said. ''And you will be chased away from your village, your home.'' On May 11, four days before the election, Mr. Komichi and other opposition workers were jailed after government supporters attacked young men putting up posters about a speech by the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, Morgan Tsvangirai. Many were not freed until May 13, after the speech, which, like most opposition rallies, was ringed by ZANU-PF trucks and activists wearing party T-shirts. Mr. Komichi, a member of the opposition party since it was formed in 1999, said he was running some risk by complaining to a foreigner about the election irregularities. He added that after a half-dozen arrests and a beating, he did not mind. ''I am committed,'' he said. ''I am a politician. I have to be known. I am not violating any law by speaking. I am actually following the Constitution of my nation.''

The parliament, flush with new members from Mugabe's ruling party after a March legislative election that was denounced by many international observers as rigged,  cast 103 votes for the constitutional changes, enough for the two-thirds majority needed in the body of 150 members. News reports from Harare, the Zimbabwean capital, said ruling party lawmakers began singing and dancing over the victory. The practical effect of the changes was hard to predict in a country where the government has already endorsed violent land invasions, demolished hundreds of thousands of homes, shuttered independent newspapers and threatened would-be protesters with arrest and attack. But opposition leaders predicted that Mugabe, who is expected to swiftly sign the changes into law, would soon revoke their passports, making it more difficult for them to lobby for international pressure against Mugabe's autocratic leadership. ""We are the immediate targets,"" said Paul Themba Nyathi, spokesman for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, speaking by phone from Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second-largest city. ""They are going to take away our passports. I'm sure of that."" Nyathi and others, however, said the vote was mainly an act of defiance by Mugabe's government, which has increasingly been isolated by the United Nations and most of the developed world. In July, the United Nations issued a sharply worded report condemning Mugabe's Operation Murambatsvina, or ""Drive Out the Rubbish,"" a demolition campaign that left 700,000 people homeless or without jobs. ""This is them thumbing their nose at the rest of the world,"" Nyathi said of Tuesday's vote in parliament. Mugabe's spokesman, George Charamba, could not be reached by phone Tuesday. On state radio, Agriculture Minister Joseph Made praised the new legal restrictions placed on white former farm owners who seek to challenge government confiscations of their land. ""Today is a happy moment,"" Charamba said, according to the Reuters news service. ""This gives us an opportunity as Zimbabweans to be the true owners of the land and to be truly independent."" Faced with hyperinflation, 70 percent unemployment and a paralyzing shortage of fuel, Mugabe has recently sought financial assistance from friendly countries, including South Africa and China. A team from the International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, has been making a final evaluation before deciding whether to expel Zimbabwe for failing to pay $295 million in debt. But Mugabe, 81, Zimbabwe's ruler since 1980, has steadfastly resisted any political reform, refusing even to meet with opposition leaders. Among the constitutional changes approved Tuesday was the creation of a 65-member senate, which opponents said would merely give Mugabe more opportunities for patronage by appointing members of his party. The measure limiting rights of appeal against government land seizures drew strong opposition from lawyers. It also touched a particularly raw nerve politically. Many Zimbabweans date the decline of their once-prosperous economy to the government-sanctioned invasions of white-owned commercial farms that began in 2000. Although the seizures have been popular with landless peasants who were given farms, agricultural production in Zimbabwe, once regarded as the region's breadbasket, has plummeted so dramatically that millions of Zimbabweans now rely on international food donations each year. The economy also has contracted by at least one-third in that time. Lovemore Madhuku, a government opponent who chairs a civic group called the National Constitutional Assembly, denounced the changes as contrary to the wishes of Zimbabweans. His group has led efforts to seek a comprehensive review of the constitution. ""We are concerned that government continues to make law without consulting the broad section of our country,"" Madhuku said by phone from Harare."31-Aug-00,,"Ivory Coast's ruling junta postponed its presidential elections today, saying the move was necessary to prepare for a ""credible and transparent"" vote to return the nation to civilian rule. The month-long postponement comes amid rising ethnic tensions and political uncertainty in the country, which was, until last year, an island of stability in the volatile West African region. Government spokesman Lt. Henri Cesar Sama announced on state radio that the vote, originally scheduled for Sept. 17, will not be held until Oct. 22. The National Electoral Commission requested the delay because it needed more time to prepare the balloting, he said. Diplomats and international observers had warned for several weeks that electoral preparations were far behind schedule and the timetable needed to be adjusted. The delay will likely heighten the tensions. Gen. Robert Guei, who took control after lower-ranking soldiers seized power on Christmas Eve, caused a national uproar this month by announcing his candidacy for the presidency, despite having initially pledged not to seek office. The United States and France took the unusual step of publicly urging Guei not to run, saying his candidacy would taint the electoral process because he would be in a position, as junta leader, to manipulate the results. Those opposing Guei say he is ineligible to run because he is an active duty military officer; Guei says he is retired. In a nationally televised address Tuesday night, Guei defended his bid for office, saying there ""is much left to do"" to rebuild the country and that his candidacy reflects no personal ambition. The coup d'etat Guei led in December was the first in this country, where long-time president Felix Houphouet-Boigny ran a one-party system that emphasized ethnic and religious harmony. Houphouet-Boigny ran the country from 1960, when Ivory Coast gained independence from France, until his death in 1993. Now, that unity seems to be jeopardized. Guei's main opponent is likely to be former prime minister and International Monetary Fund official Alassane Ouattara, a Muslim from the north. But his candidacy is being challenged under a controversial provision of the nation's new constitution, which says that both a candidate's mother and father must be Ivorian born. Ouattara's opponents argue that one of his parents was born in neighboring Burkina Faso, something he denies. In recent weeks, the military has been particularly harsh on Ouattara's party. This month, troops used whips and clubs to break up a legally authorized march by Ouattara supporters, stripping some naked and forcing them to crawl on their knees down the street. This week security forces summoned the nation's leading Muslim clerics, who support Ouattara, and accused them of trying to ""destabilize"" the government and plotting a coup. The other main candidate could be former interior minister Emile Constant Bombet. But Bombet is accused of corruption and could become ineligible if formal charges are lodged against him. The Constitutional Chamber of the supreme court has until two weeks before the election to rule on candidates' eligibility, but independent observers have challenged its impartiality because the chamber's president served as Guei's legal adviser before being appointed to the court."30-Mar-00,,"When Gen. Robert Guei was drafted by mutinous soldiers to head an interim government after they ousted the elected leadership on Christmas Eve, Ivory Coast political parties and friendly governments welcomed his promises of a quick return to democracy. But now there is growing concern among political leaders and diplomats that Guei, who has pledged to remain neutral in a presidential election set for October, will succumb to pressure from the army's unruly, undisciplined and restless enlisted men and launch his own presidential bid--or simply abort the return to civilian rule. Either move, diplomats and analysts warn, would be a serious setback for West Africa, where most countries have histories of political instability, coups and corrupt military leadership. Until the Christmas Eve takeover--the first ever here--Ivory Coast was viewed as one of West Africa's few bastions of stability and progress. Last week in Senegal, another regional bright spot, the governing Socialist Party lost power after 40 years in a second round of elections, but the situation in the rest of the region is grimmer. The fragile eight-month-old civilian government in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, is struggling with corruption and ethnic and religious strife. Most of the other countries, notably Sierra Leone and Liberia, are suffering from festering civil wars and political unrest, making a smooth return to democracy in Ivory Coast especially important, diplomats say. A Guei candidacy ""would set a horrible precedent. . . . [He] will condemn the credibility of the entire transition if he has partisan interests to protect,"" said Christopher Fomunyoh, West Africa director of the Washington-based National Democratic Institute. ""The only way to end this is for [Guei] to be clear and unequivocal about leading the transition in a neutral and transparent way."" Following a recent tour of military barracks across the country, Guei has grown increasingly and publicly ambivalent about his plans, refusing to rule out a presidential bid because of pressure from the troops to retain power, according to people who deal regularly with him. That ambivalence, Ivorian and diplomatic sources say, is strengthening the military faction that wants to retain control, either through a Guei candidacy or by canceling elections. Guei's office did not return a reporter's phone calls. Rumblings from recent abortive coup plots coupled with an erosion of discipline in the army have weakened Guei's grip on the military, diplomats and analysts say. A disintegration of command and control structures was demonstrated recently when enlisted men defied Guei's direct orders to dismantle concrete and barbed wire barricades that were erected around radio and television stations during the coup. Enlisted men control the main military base, where the army's weapons are stored. Many here in the capital are most troubled by policemen and soldiers who regularly shake down motorists for small bribes in broad daylight. While petty corruption has long been a fact of life here, many residents say the new brazenness has heightened their sense of insecurity and uncertainty. Many of the soldiers on the streets are wearing new boots and uniforms from a lot of 800 provided by the U.S. military after a counter-terrorism training course that ended just before the coup. ""You see policemen and soldiers drunk in the morning, wearing dark glasses and demanding money for nothing,"" said one businessman. ""It never used to be like that. Never. They can act with impunity, and increasingly they do."" Regional leaders, as well as French and U.S. diplomats, have warned Guei that international support for Ivory Coast, already tenuous, would dry up if he were to run or call off the balloting. The country's budget, about 30 percent of which comes from European aid and international lending organizations, has already been hit hard because much of the aid was suspended after the coup. The lack of resources and the growing deterioration of discipline in army ranks have made Guei's position tenuous, local and diplomatic sources say. The troops rioted in the first place because the government had withheld the pay they earned as U.N. peacekeepers in the Central African Republic. Since then, Guei has been unable to meet the soldiers' demands for increased pay and greater resources, so they have been trying to make money on the street. One diplomat described the army as ""a multi-headed monster"" in which ""the officers are clearly not in charge."" Thus, they say, Guei must tread softly to avoid a potentially bloody showdown. ""The enlisted men mutinied and then brought Guei in, and they remind him constantly that he owes his position to them,"" the diplomat said. ""They want their slice of the pie after years of neglect, and there is definitely a faction in the military that does not want a return to civilian rule."" Senior political leaders--many of whom were initially sympathetic to the coup because of the authoritarianism and corruption of President Henri Konan Bedie's regime--are now growing uneasy. ""What we want is for the military to return to its barracks as quickly as possible, with a good democratic transition and with a legal government in place,"" said one political leader in contact with the president. ""But Gen. Guei is not alone, and there are a lot of voices competing to be heard. We still trust Guei, but he may be under too much pressure. If he gets it into his head to be a candidate, it will be a disaster."" Guei's relationship with the country's leading political parties is also tenuous. While the Rally of Republicans--led by former International Monetary Fund deputy director Alassane Ouattara--generally supported the coup because the party was being challenged by the Bedie government, it has most to lose if Guei runs. ""We still trust Guei,"" said one Rally leader, ""but . . . if he gets it into his head to be a candidate it will be a disaster."" Because of Guei's perceived closeness to Ouattara's party and the fact that several Rally leaders accepted cabinet positions in Guei's government, other parties distrust him. Opposition leaders routinely charge that Ouattara is the real power behind Guei and that Guei plans to run or postpone the elections because Ouattara cannot win. Guei reacted angrily to such charges, telling local journalists: ""I am not a hostage of any political party or at the service of any political leader."" He said he plans to ""do the will of the people,"" a phrase he has used often."5-Feb-98,,"War veterans shouted down President Robert G. Mugabe during a speech, stormed his party headquarters, and reportedly mooned one of his ministers to protest suspended disability pay. In parliament, Mugabe's ruling party has defied him. Disgruntled farm laborers have marched to demand better work conditions, and urban workers angered by tax hikes shut down this capital city for a day. All this discontent over the past year was just prelude. Last month, this city was hit by its first serious wave of unrest in 18 years of independence, as thousands of rioters angered by yet another price hike for maize meal, the staple food, caused such destruction and anarchy for three days that the army was deployed to restore order. As this formerly socialist nation undergoes a difficult transition to a free market, Mugabe finds himself not only in battle with an economy out of control, but with an increasingly restive populace. Zimbabweans once saw him as father of the nation -- he led the independence struggle against Britain -- but now want to know what he has done for them lately. Not enough, the riots seemed to say. Many people predict that if the government does not rein in the spiraling prices, a depreciating currency, rampant unemployment and creeping governmental corruption, then more unrest will likely follow. In Chitungwiza, a suburb 12 miles south of the city center where a large shopping mall was picked clean of virtually all products in the January rioting, a young woman named Florence said more riots were needed to force the government into action. ""We want it to happen again, because nothing has changed."" In this nation of 12 million -- peaceful during the years of socialist policies, which ended in the early 1990s -- scenes of rioters looting stores and battling with police would appear to represent instability. But this is a de facto one-party state in which Mugabe's party holds all but three of the 150 seats in parliament. Some analysts say the grass-roots protest movement represents a new form of unorganized political opposition that could bode well for democratization -- if it does not mushroom out of control. ""They are not afraid anymore,"" Sam Moyo of the Southern African Regional Institute for Policy Studies said of the protesters. ""This is a series of mutinies,"" said Morgan Tsvangirai, secretary general of the 300,000-member Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, which called the one-day strike in December and has threatened to do it again. Even the government-run Herald newspaper has chimed in with criticism. It castigated government ministers for being out of touch and warned that Zimbabwe would see ""a disaster unfold"" if the government did not realize that the riots must represent ""the end of the era of business as usual."" In response to the riots, the government ordered the maize price increase rescinded. It had acted similarly in response to the December labor strike, when it withdrew a new wage levy. Mugabe also has established a ministerial commission to look into price levels, the crash of the currency, market competition and ways of creating jobs. Unemployment is 50 percent. The government also has assured international lenders that it will reduce state spending and privatize state assets. It will also attempt to restore confidence in the national currency, the Zimbabwe dollar, which lost 75 percent of its value against the dollar on one bleak day in November, and rebuild the foreign reserves which were so depleted that the government had trouble covering import costs late last year. The International Monetary Fund said last week that it soon may approve $ 176 million in balance-of-payments support to ease the crisis and help spur reforms. But the government has promised reform before, then abruptly shifted course for political expediency. The current crisis stems from the domino effect of a series of economic calamities set in motion by corruption charges last year. It began in March. Faced with allegations that Mugabe's ministers and other high officials had looted a disability fund for veterans of the liberation war, the government suspended payments while it investigated who got the money and why. A cabinet minister admitted that she received thousands of dollars she should not have from the fund. Veterans protested the suspension. To quiet the 50,000 veterans eligible for compensation, Mugabe promised them lump sums totaling $ 260 million -- from a national budget deeply in debt and in which no provision had been made for such an impromptu payout. Investors got jittery and the stock exchange began to flutter. Then, it was revealed that foreign reserves were so low that imports could barely be covered for November and December. In response, the currency fell like an anchor. Meanwhile, in a move a Western diplomat described as a ""political diversion,"" Mugabe declared that his government would make good on its promise to acquire land for the rural poor by expropriating land of underutilized commercial farms, most of which are owned by whites. Whites are a 2 percent minority of the population but own 70 percent of the nation's arable land, much of it seized from blacks during the colonial era. With the announcement of the land plan, the economy shook further, since agriculture accounts for 40 percent of exports and fueled Zimbabwe's estimated 6 percent economic growth last year -- a growth rate that made it an economic leader in the region. At the same time, Mugabe's cabinet -- over the protests of parliament -- slapped a controversial levy on workers' salaries and more price hikes on consumer goods to cover the veterans' payout. This awakened the wrath of labor, which mounted its December strike. Then came January and housewives' discovery last week that the price of maize had been raised 21 percent, the third hike in four months. Maize is a staple of the Zimbabwean diet. Sadza, or boiled maize, which is similar to grits, traditionally is eaten only for supper and dinner, although many poor families unable to afford other food have begun eating it for breakfast, as well. ""Those ministers, they eat and they have everything and we are suffering,"" said Kate Chawora, 26, a woman expecting her second child. Her husband works in a factory. ""We are trying harder to buy everything. The money isn't enough. The wages which our husbands are paid cannot match with the prices."" Some reports say mothers were among the most volatile elements of the population when the maize meal price hike was discovered in local markets. In the riots the followed, five people reportedly were killed. Information Minister Chen Chimutengwende blamed whites for the situation. He said they want to punish Mugabe for his land acquisition plan. ""There was an element of massive profiteering and massive taking advantage of the situation by some businessmen who are mainly white,"" he said. ""It's no longer market forces; it's cartels."" Through it all, Mugabe has remained aloof, some say. A leader who views himself as an international statesman as much as a president, in part because he leads the Organization of African Unity, he spends much of his time abroad, including 22 foreign trips last year, by the Western diplomat's count. What happens next is largely dependent on Mugabe's next move, many here say. Within his government, ""the culture now is such that no one questions his decisions,"" an economic analyst said. ""No one challenges his proposals or ideas."" They don't question him openly, but some here say that criticism of Mugabe has slowly and quietly begun to filter out of his ruling clique. And Mugabe may face yet another crisis soon: The trade union group has warned of another protest within the next month."26-Jan-98,,"Warfare has escalated in Sierra Leone, underscoring a stalemate in diplomatic efforts to force the military junta to accept a return to civilian rule. In recent days, reports of battles in the jungles and rice-growing lands of the southeast have trickled out of Sierra Leone. They say thousands of people have been forced from their villages by the fighting, in which traditional tribal hunters, known as kamajors, oppose government troops. The biggest recent battle has been over Tongo, one of Sierra Leone's main diamond-mining towns. Kamajors captured Tongo on Jan. 17-18, forcing at least 4,000 civilians to flee, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Freetown, the capital. The junta seized power last May but agreed in October to hand it back to the civilian president, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, on April 22. But a truce has failed to take hold, and a West African peacekeeping force that was to have deployed across the country by December has not done so. The government, an awkward alliance between the Sierra Leonean army and a longtime rebel movement, has been divided almost from the start on whether to hand back power, and analysts say it appears unlikely to do so by the deadline. Sierra Leone is an extreme example of many chronic African political ills. Colonial rulers -- in this case, the British -- built a centralized bureaucracy that held power only by military force and exploited the economy. The end of colonialism left a handful of political factions in the capital to struggle for control of the bureaucracy, which, through corruption, was the country's only source of wealth. During the nearly four decades since Sierra Leone -- and most other African colonies -- gained independence, the narrow concentration of power has excluded and impoverished rural peoples. The state's corruption and lack of popular support has left it unable to exercise control in the countryside. Last year, the United Nations' annual study of global development found Sierra Leone the world's poorest country. Its 5 million people are estimated to live, on average, 34 years, and only about 30 percent learn to read and write. Since the 1970s, deprivation has been most acute in the south and east -- and in 1991, a radical guerrilla group, the Revolutionary United Front, began an armed rebellion in those areas. A junta that seized power in 1992 proved unable to contain the rebellion. In Sierra Leone's biggest step toward pluralist, democratic rule, it held elections in 1996 and handed power to the winner -- Kabbah, a former diplomat. Kabbah negotiated a truce with the Revolutionary United Front and cut the state budget deficit as part of a program, with the International Monetary Fund, to stabilize the economy. Last May, low-ranking soldiers, paid as little as $ 18 per month, rebelled over army layoffs and cuts in rice rations. They chose a mutinous officer, Maj. Johnny Paul Koromah, to lead them and invited the Revolutionary United Front guerrillas to join them in a government called the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council. A unit of Nigerian troops, which had been based in Freetown to provide security and technical help to Kabbah's government, briefly fought the coup before retreating to hold the main airport. Koromah declared he would keep power until 2001. But international sanctions, divisions between the Revolutionary United Front and the Sierra Leonean army, and opposition from Kabbah supporters have prevented the junta from gaining full control. In rural villages, many of which suffered heavily from years of Revolutionary United Front raiding, traditional tribal hunting associations have formed a militia, under Kabbah's main military aide, to support the ousted president. Nigerian troops, warships and warplanes have periodically shelled or bombed the country -- and they enforce a semi-effective economic blockade. Neighboring states and the United Nations have isolated the junta, imposing an embargo on arms and oil sales. This month, President Clinton barred members of the ruling junta or their families from traveling to the United States. In Freetown, ""the sanctions are biting hard, but people are coping,"" said Babsy Coker-Gibbs, editor of a local magazine. Despite the blockade, small boats smuggle in enough oil to run the city's power plant and fuel cars, ""although [auto] fuel is four to five times the normal price,"" she said by telephone. Both sides in the conflict reported the fighting at Tongo, although both now claim to control the town and its diamond deposits -- one of the economy's few sources of wealth. About 4,000 to 6,000 refugees have fled toward the eastern town of Kenema, said Alexandra Mateevich, of the Red Cross in Freetown. Travelers reaching Freetown have described burned villages and bodies by the road. The government said last week it had captured Grima, a small town near Koribundu, and other clashes have been reported but not confirmed. Koromah's government has refused to disarm its forces as the October accord requires, saying that Nigeria should free the Revolutionary United Front leader, Cpl. Foday Sankannah Sankoh, who it has detained since the coup. Koromah also says Nigeria has taken sides in the dispute and should not be permitted to keep its leading role in the West African peacekeeping force."4-Jan-98,,"President Daniel arap Moi's swearing-in ceremony in the next day or two will cap a tumultuous week in which irregularities fouled Kenya's third multi-party election since its independence 35 years ago. Yet the story is far from over. This election -- which could have reassured foreign governments, domestic and international investors, and Kenyans themselves -- instead has cemented a sense of deepening social and political crisis in this country of 27 million. Once considered one of East Africa's more stable countries, it now is judged among the more fragile states. Its economy has imploded. Corruption is pervasive. The infrastructure is a wreck. Urban unemployment has skyrocketed. Basic government services, such as schools and health care, are a shambles. Ethnic tensions have sharpened. Thus far Kenya has remained relatively peaceful in the face of a disorganized, ill-managed election, accusations against the government of vote-rigging and the opposition's rejection of provisional results. The electoral commission announced late Friday that Moi, who faced 11 challengers, had garnered 39 percent, with most of the vote counted. He is followed by Mwai Kibaki, a former vice president, with 33 percent and Raila Odinga, with 11.5 percent. It also appeared that Moi easily would gain a required 25 percent of the vote in five of Kenya's eight provinces. At least eight people have died in election-related violence, but most of the nation remains calm. Yet no one is taking bets on how long the peace will last. Increasingly urgent political and economic uncertainties and problems are prodding Kenya toward ""social instability,"" one diplomat said. ""Everybody's patience has a breaking point. If these trends continue, that breaking point could come sooner, rather than later."" Not long ago, Kenya was the jewel of East Africa, despite Moi's authoritarian rule. It boasted decent roads, strong telecommunications, a fine education system, a blooming economy, a vibrant middle class and a safe, well-kept capital. Things worked. It was known for its spectacular greenery and its rich wildlife. Numerous international organizations placed regional headquarters here. The turmoil that paralyzed surrounding countries only burnished Kenya's image. Sudan was enmeshed in a decades-long civil war. A brutal communist dictatorship was strangling Ethiopia. Uganda was emerging from civil war. Somalia was hurtling toward one. Today, as countries such as Ethiopia, Uganda and Tanzania have tugged themselves toward relative stability, Kenya is tumbling in the opposite direction. On recent trips to East Africa, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton bypassed Kenya. One primary problem is an economy crippled by corruption, mismanagement and political uncertainty. Last year, government corruption compelled the International Monetary Fund to suspend a $ 205 million loan, and political unrest caused tourism -- the government's main source of foreign exchange -- to plummet by 60 percent. Foreign and domestic investment has halted, and economic analysts say that this election will only further wither the confidence of potential investors. Meanwhile, the government is racing toward bankruptcy. The decimated tourism industry, settlement of a national teachers' strike and election-related spending -- much of it allegedly used to aid the ruling party -- have helped wipe out the government's revenue. It faces a growing deficit, and interest rates, already prohibitive, are expected to keep climbing. These pressures squeeze a country that is the 22nd poorest in the world. Some 500,000 to 700,000 job seekers enter the employment market annually, only to find pitifully few jobs. The government has corraled inflation in the past year or so, but prices for most basic foodstuffs have doubled or tripled this decade. As she waited to vote at a Nairobi polling station last Monday, Christine Gathoni, 23, said she is paying twice as much for milk, bread, rice and corn meal, compared with recent years. She pays nearly three times as much for sugar. Gathoni, a receptionist, is eight months pregnant. She was not planning to vote for Moi. ""If we get another president, things will change,"" Gathoni said. A new president would ""make life easier. We need jobs."" However, she was resigned to Moi retaining power and convinced that he and the ruling party would rig the vote. ""We're just voting, but we know he'll be back again,"" she said. A smooth election would have surprised Gathoni and would have provided Moi with something he and his floundering country desperately need: a legitimate government. Moi, who took power in 1978 after Kenya's first post-independence president died, returned the country to multi-party rule in 1991. He now has won two multi-party votes this decade -- the first in 1992 -- in which he did not come close to getting 50 percent of the vote. And both contests were tainted by confusion and vote-rigging charges. ""Moi will not be able to say yes, I truly won this, or yes, I truly lost it,"" said George Nyamweya, deputy secretary general of the Democratic Party, whose presidential candidate will finish second behind Moi in this election. ""There's a question about his mandate."" Two theories prevail as to Moi's post-election strategy. One is that he will toughen up, as he did after the 1992 elections, when he arrested enemies, shackled the independent media and blocked political rallies. The other theory holds that he will assuage foreign governments by attacking corruption and embracing political and economic reforms fully. But analysts fear that Moi's lack of legitimacy will weaken him as he grapples not only with Kenya's bleeding economy but also with social problems such as ethnic tensions. Those tensions are expected to grow fiercer as the economy slides further. Others fear that the mismanaged election has clobbered Kenyans' confidence in the election process. Thousands of voters waited for hours -- sometimes returning a second day -- to cast their ballots. Some Kenyans worry that their fellow citizens' extraordinary patience may be fraying. Kenyans are ""hopelessly dissatisfied,"" said Paul Muite, a founding member of the opposition Safina party, which has accepted the election's results. They are frustrated with a system in which ""the economic and social situation is divorced from politics . . . [and] people are interested in political power for its own sake."" At some point, ""people will get tired of analyses and philosophies,"" Muite said. ""They'll want solutions."""27-Jul-97,,"For the first time since Kenyan opposition groups started agitating for constitutional reform earlier this year, thousands of people were allowed to assemble peacefully in a dusty park this afternoon and listen to speeches from their leaders lambasting the authoritarian President of this East African country. The rally was a major victory for the loose coalition of civil rights leaders, opposition politicians and clergy members who have been staging protests since late May to press the Government to open up Kenya's repressive political system. The coalition -- known as the National Convention Assembly -- is seeking to scrap several archaic laws that give President Daniel arap Moi sweeping powers to crush protests, jail dissidents and ban political parties. The members also want to change electoral rules that they maintain make it impossible for a challenger to unseat the incumbent. Mr. Moi, 73, has ruled Kenya as a personal fief since 1978 through his party, the Kenya African National Union. He only begrudgingly endedthe one-party state and instituted multiparty elections in 1992 after a similar round of violent confrontations drew international condemnation and a freeze on foreign aid. The peaceful rally today contrasted starkly with the riots that racked this country in late May and again on July 7, when Government paramilitary police officers crushed protests across the country, killing at least nine people in the worst political violence here since 1991. The Government decided on Friday night to let the rally go ahead without interference, after heavy pressure was brought to bear from at least 22 foreign embassies. The statements from Western diplomats contained an underlying unspoken threat that Kenya's foreign aid might be cut off if Mr. Moi did not allow greater political freedom. Also on Friday, the International Monetary Fund threatened to hold up a $36 million loan disbursement to the country, saying that Mr. Moi's Government had made little progress in stamping out corruption. Though the rally was considered by many to be a moral victory for its organizers, the turnout was modest -- about 3,500 people in a teeming city of 800,000 people known as an opposition stronghold. As the afternoon wore on, the oratory became more and more vitriolic. As they rose one by one to the wooden dais to speak, the opposition politicians appeared to be making stump speeches rather than talking about constitutional issues. The crowd chanted ""Moi Must Go!"" and ""No Reforms, No Elections!"" For the most part, the Government maintained its distance today. Only a handful of police officers patrolled near the grounds. A group of about 30 members of the ruling party's youth wing made a half-hearted attempt to disrupt the rally before it began, but they were run off by the opposition leaders' security guards. At the end, the crowd broke up and scattered quietly. Many residents who had watched from the sidelines breathed a sigh of relief."28-Jan-96,,"The president and his cronies are accused far and wide of using the treasury as their personal bank account. Buses don't run. Phones don't work. The jungle is fast overtaking many roads. But the people of Zaire, despite decades of corruption and ineptitude, have found ways to adapt. Education has all but collapsed in parts of the country where teachers are not being paid. To fill the void, parents have started their own schools or, if they can afford it, are paying teachers' salaries themselves. Ambulances are few, so when a disaster happens -- such as the plane crash here in the capital this month that killed as many as 350 people -- private citizens take the injured to the hospital in their own cars. To prevent soldiers from stealing civilians' food, people in one town have taught the soldiers how to harvest crops themselves. Money is so tight that some families have been reduced to feeding their children every other day. Rich in diamonds, copper and other minerals, and vast enough to border nine other nations, Zaire -- with an area the size of the United States east of the Mississippi and a population of 44 million -- has long been considered one of Central Africa's pivotal countries. During the Cold War, the United States and other Western nations eagerly backed the country's anti-communist leader, President Mobutu Sese Seko. But as superpower rivalries have withered and the excesses of Mobutu's 30-year rule have taken their toll, his standing has diminished at home and abroad. As he and his opposition remain stalemated in their protracted five-year transition to democratic elections, government has lost meaning for many Zairians as they attempt each day to secure survival and thereby accept what elsewhere would be unacceptable. That point is driven home routinely when one of the overloaded and unregulated trucks that are used as buses crashes and kills dozens of passengers. Zairians are ""pioneering new coping mechanisms,"" said Ian Brown, head of the Oxfam relief agency, one of several nongovernmental organizations, including churches, whose educational, training and medical services are virtually supplanting the collapsed and paralyzed state. ""The leaders are struggling with each other instead of taking care of the real situation of the country,"" said Sidonie Memba, 37, who grows corn by the side of a road and sells it to passersby. A mother of 10, she said she earns the equivalent of about $ 10 on a good day. ""If I do not sell, I won't get anything to eat, so I don't care much about politics because I don't get anything from the fight."" Zaire's economic and political squeeze is hard to live with, but nothing can be done about it, said Sophie Kanku, 28, who sells shoes in a large outdoor market. Like several Zairians interviewed at random, Kanku freely expressed her disaffection with the president and his power. ""He has got guns,"" she said. ""We have no guns. And he has got money. We are empty-handed."" Kanku and Prisca Nta, 22, together expressed the fear that the truck accidents and plane crashes that have taken so many lives recently are a kind of extension of Mobutu's power to wear down the will of people who might oppose him. In response to this sense of powerlessness in the face of a seemingly larger-than-life leader once known as ""the Guide,"" Zairians have mobilized in hundreds of small ways to eke out a living. Children beg in the streets but also shine shoes for cash. Men sell rusted tin cans and rags for reuse. Families or neighbors share food to help each other out. With the degeneration of government, more people are using any pretext for demanding cash, making for a nation on the take: Perhaps the airport workers who demand cash at the baggage X-ray machine have children at home in need of food; or perhaps they are just taking out of greed. That pervasive greed has given Zaire the label of ""kleptocracy,"" a reference to the system of thievery that those with intimate knowledge of Zaire say has characterized the official approach to the public purse for several years. The kleptocracy has rendered this vast, resource-rich nation unable -- and apparently unwilling -- to provide basic services. The telephone system, for example, does not work because ""money to be used for maintenance has been stolen,"" said U.S. Ambassador Daniel Simpson. ""Instead of laying the cables, they stole the money."" Zairians now rely on cellular phones -- if they can afford them. The same can be said of the national airline, transport corporation and copper mines -- all bankrupted by a combination of mismanagement and corruption. Copper production, which used to account for 70 percent of export earnings, has fallen from about 488,000 tons a year in 1988 to less than a tenth of that today, said Mabi Mulumba, head of the Zairian equivalent of the General Accounting Office. He said his office has documented the ""misallocation"" of 30 percent of the state budget in 1994. Diamond mining has increased in recent years, but it is largely controlled by foreign interests or syndicates. So out of control was the state treasury in the early 1990s that two-thirds of the currency in circulation was counterfeit, said Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo, who is lauded by the Clinton administration for reining in the central bank and breaking up Lebanese and Zairian syndicates that flooded Zaire with counterfeit cash. Because of the economic mess, all foreign assistance to Zaire has stopped. U.S. law bars direct aid to a government in arrears on U.S. loans; Zaire owes the United States $ 800 million. The European Union also closed the aid pipeline when Mobutu reneged on his promise to share power with the opposition. Under intense international pressure -- the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund also stopped giving aid -- Mobutu agreed in 1990 to put an end to the one-party state and open the way for multi-party democracy. Since then, transitional governments have changed so often that people here have lost count. The Clinton administration, meanwhile, is looking to Kengo for reform. He was selected as prime minister by the transitional parliament after its original choice, Etienne Tshisekedi, was fired by Mobutu despite a pledge to accept the opposition's choice. Although Kengo is highly unpopular because of a manner that some here describe as dictatorial and because of his ties to Mobutu, for whom he was prime minister twice before, Washington views him as a safe bet on the grounds that he is ineligible for the presidency and thus presumably cannot be corrupted by ambition. By law, the presidency is reserved for people of Zairian parentage. Kengo was born of Polish and Zairian parents. The stern-faced prime minister, however, smiled when asked in an interview if his ambitions are being thwarted by the parentage law. Noting the fluidity of the transition and the recent appointment of an electoral commission, he said: ""The electoral law is not yet set."" Supporters of Tshisekedi fault Kengo for his ties to Mobutu and for not improving life for Zairians through gains in schools, hospitals and salaries of government employees. ""The Westerners who are supporting Kengo are doing their best not to talk about the bad aspects,"" said Mukenda wa Mulumba, an aide to Tshisekedi. ""I'm not blaming the Westerners for what may happen, but they have part of the responsibility for supporting a bad scheme that doesn't lead the country toward success or improvement."" Mobutu, meanwhile, remains the Big Man presiding over Zairian politics but spends most of his time at his jungle palace in the equatorial town of Gbadolite, from which he ventures only rarely. He has promised to travel around the nation to campaign in advance of elections that are to take place by July 1997."24-Oct-95,,"Since coming to office nearly two years ago, President Henri Konan Bedie has publicly declared his ambition of turning the Ivory Coast into West Africa's economic powerhouse. He has even suggested a nickname for his country of 14 million: the ""Elephant of Africa."" Under his guidance, he promises, this beast will soon be pulling the rest of this mostly poor region into the 21st century. Judging by how he organized the vote on Sunday that gave him his first electoral mandate to run the country, however, Ivoirian and foreign political analysts say Mr. Bedie's vision of his country seems to allow little room for democracy. Although Mr. Bedie's supporters say that turnout was high and that the President, who took office when his predecessor died in December 1993, won more than 90 percent of the vote in a contested election, many foreign experts and many Ivoirians came away with an almost opposite conclusion. Even if it is true that the incumbent won, they note, few Ivoirians seemed to bother to vote in what many saw as an empty formality. And if Mr. Bedie managed to score nearly as highly as his predecessor, the country's founding father, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, customarily did in ritualized single-party plebiscites, the victory came only after Government rules eliminated the President's most viable rivals. If the Ivory Coast, with its skyscrapers, glass-smooth highways and relatively prosperous middle class is virtually alone among African countries in its stated objective of following Asia's ""economic dragons"" into prosperity, Mr. Bedie is far from alone among African leaders in seeking to hold on to power by manipulating election rules. All across a continent that was swept dramatically by the winds of multiparty politics at the turn of the decade, incumbents have been rewriting the rules of the game, bullying opponents and restricting the press in order to hold on to power regardless of their popularity or the success of their programs. In Zambia, as the country's second democratic elections approach, President Frederick J. T. Chiluba has begun to arrest critics, including a journalist, Fred Mbembe, who was recently sentenced to 100 years in prison for his coverage of Government corruption. Mr. Chiluba's aides also recently sought the arrest or expulsion of his electoral rival, the former President Kenneth D. Kaunda, on charges that he was not Zambian. This, despite the fact that Mr. Kaunda led Zambia's independence struggle from Britain and served as President for nearly three decades. In Kenya, supporters of the longtime leader, President Daniel arap Moi, who was pressed earlier in the decade by international creditors to accept a more open multiparty system, have taken to assaulting rivals, notably Richard Leakey, the paleontologist, who began organizing an opposition party earlier this year. When the military in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, decided it could not stomach the result of democratic elections two years ago, it canceled the results. The widely assumed winner, Moshood K. O. Abiola, was imprisoned on treason charges after he insisted that his mandate be respected. Here in the Ivory Coast, Mr. Bedie has called his own brand of politics ""democratie apaisee."" The President's aides might translate the slogan as ""peaceful democracy."" But for the Government's critics, the President's use of security forces to round up dissidents, his tight control of electronic media, the arrest of journalists and his rewriting of electoral laws suggest something more akin to ""pacified democracy."" Taking a page from Mr. Chiluba in Zambia, Mr. Bedie's supporters wrote a new electoral code that insisted that any candidate have purely Ivoirian parents. The widely understood intent was to block the candidacy of the man who was Prime Minister at Mr. Houphouet-Boigny's death in 1993, Alassane D. Ouattara. Mr. Ouattara, who Mr. Bedie insists is of foreign extraction, is deputy director of the International Monetary Fund in Washington and was widely seen here as the politician with the best chance of unseating the President in a fair election. ""President Bedie has tolerated irregularities that do not honor our country,"" said Diegou Bailly, editor of Le Jour, an independent newspaper. ""Politics are intimately linked to economics, and the 'African elephant' that the Ivory Coast seeks to build must first be built on the basis of confidence, right here at home."" If early in this decade many African countries briefly felt pressure from the West to apply widely recognized standards of democracy, African human rights advocates and Government opponents say that more recently, the West has quietly dropped these standards. Experts from the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, a nongovernmental group in Washington, canceled its election observer mission to the Ivory Coast after the Government's refusal to accept proposals by local church and human rights groups on a legal framework to restore confidence in the elections. The United States Embassy here has declined to comment on the elections. Many Africans say that nowhere has the shrinking Western commitment to democracy in the continent been greater than in France, however. African intellectuals liken Paris's political attachment to its former colonies here, no matter how corrupt or undemocratic, to Washington's support for Central American dictatorships during the cold war. The only difference, they say, is that where Washington saw a Communist under every bed, France imagines foreign plotting to usurp its role in a region it has long dominated. In the Ivory Coast, the cornerstone of France's former holdings in West Africa, on a day when security forces shot dead two demonstrators during the campaign earlier this month, the French Minister for Cooperation, Jacques Godfrain, gave a speech in which he said of Mr. Bedie, ""France will be by your side, Mr. President, for the long period that lies ahead of you."" Abou Dramane Sangare, a leader of the Ivoirian Popular Front, one of two main opposition groups that boycotted the elections, said, ""France does not play the game of democracy in Africa."" ""De Gaulle said France has no friends, only interests,"" he added.  ""Now we have Chirac, who believes that democracy is a luxury that Africa cannot afford.""  TYPE: News Analysis"12-Sep-95,,"In the tally of scandals surrounding President Frederick Chiluba, let's start with the one about drugs: International donors on which Zambia is dependent forced Chiluba to cut loose a trio of top officials believed to be involved in illicit drug trade. The collapse of Zambian Airways did not help Chiluba much either, as thousands of workers lost their jobs. Soon thereafter, confidence in the economy took another blow: Depositors lost millions when the nation's fourth-largest bank went under despite the government's attempt at a bailout. Then came sex: Lusaka's crusading newspaper, the Post, alleged Chiluba had had an extramarital affair and a child whom he refused to support. And on top of it all came a bizarre twist; the Post reported: Chiluba may not be Chiluba at all and not even a full-fledged Zambian, but a man who took the identity of another and turned his back on his own foreign father. All this intrigue, plus deepening economic hardship as the country undergoes an internationally imposed structural adjustment, has eroded Chiluba's credibility so much that what once seemed unthinkable is happening. The labor leader who swept into office four years ago on a reformist wave that ended 27 years of autocratic rule under Kenneth Kaunda and buoyed hopes for democracy's spread on the continent now faces perhaps his stiffest opposition from none other than the Big Man himself. Kaunda, known here as K.K., wants his country back. Kaunda, 71, who used to publicly weep for Africa and style himself a benevolent patron to the people he helped liberate from British colonialism in what was then called Northern Rhodesia, represents the first generation of post-independence African leaders. He clung to power, developed a cult of personality, squashed opposition and imposed tight state control of the economy -- to the benefit of Zambians for a while, until fiscal strangulation ensued. Although he seemed a discredited has-been when Zambians rioted over skyrocketing food prices, ransacked his home, then booted him from office in 1991, Kaunda this summer regained the leadership of his party and has garnered the support of several important leaders within the Bemba tribe, which represents 35 percent of Zambia's nearly 9 million people. While some observers feel it unlikely that Zambians will choose to return to Kaunda and the failed socialist policies he represents, others say that the despair of the masses, especially in rural areas suffering under the dual burdens of state mismanagement of agriculture and a debilitating drought, gives Kaunda a solid shot at taking back his country in elections to be held next year. Zambians are widely disaffected by unfulfilled political promises and struggling under crushing economic hardship, which means democracy here is far less a priority than food and jobs. Four years ago, Chiluba emerged as the only leader who could oust Kaunda, and he did so with nearly 80 percent of the vote. ""The issue is just as it was in 1991,"" said Lucy Sichone, founder of the Zambian Civic Education Association and a former member of Kaunda's party. ""The only person who can get rid of Chiluba is K.K."" ""We haven't built up democratic institutions,"" said Sichone. ""That's why I'm afraid that K.K. cannot be dismissed."" Kaunda has yet to outline what economic policies he would pursue, but he is getting much mileage out of Chiluba's credibility problems, saying in a recent interview that Chiluba's Movement for Multiparty Democracy ""is a cartel for organized crime"" and that the Chiluba government contains two dozen officials whom Kaunda detained for trafficking in Mandraax, a sedative for which Zambia has become a primary transit point en route to South Africa. But Chiluba, 50, is striking back with some heavy artillery of his own. His government this month revealed what it called underground torture chambers constructed beneath State House, the presidential residence, during Kaunda's reign, when political opponents were routinely imprisoned. The government repeatedly has denied Kaunda permits to hold rallies and has arrested him for defying the ban. Chiluba's party also has floated a constitutional proposal that would place the presidency off-limits to candidates of non-Zambian parentage. Kaunda's parents were born in Malawi. As for his own parentage, Chiluba denies the newspaper report questioning his identity, as he denies all the other scandals that have tainted his presidency. What cannot be denied is the economic hardship that has fallen on most Zambians. Chiluba inherited an economic mess from Kaunda at a time when the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which had been unable to persuade Kaunda to comply with earlier structural adjustments, imposed one of the strictest adjustment programs on the globe. ""This country has undergone economic surgery without anaesthetic,"" said Gedion Nkojo, the World Bank chief here. Under Kaunda, Zambia fit the classic mold of the command economy. Through companies it controls, the state ran virtually everything, from the cultivation of maize to the baking of bread to the mining of copper. Payrolls were heavily padded, with employees receiving housing, cars and free airfare on the national airline. Even food was subsidized. But Zambia's population skyrocketed, from about 3.5 million in 1964, when Kaunda came to power, to nearly 9 million today, and the price of copper, which accounted for 90 percent of Zambia's foreign exchange earnings and as much as 50 percent of government revenues, plunged. Kaunda began to borrow heavily from international donors, sinking Zambia into a black hole of debt. Under World Bank guidance, Chiluba largely has succeeded in meeting the program's goals by lowering inflation and interest rates and stabilizing the once wildly fluctuating local currency, the kwacha, said Nkojo. He also has ended state subsidies in education and health and slowly is selling off the state-controlled companies. Such reforms have laid the groundwork for more private investment in the country and the ultimate improvement in socioeconomic conditions. But within Chiluba's own circle there are those who complain of the continued influence of state spending and patronage. For example, said Mundia Sikatana, a Chiluba adviser and a founder of the Movement for Multiparty Democracy, the government continues to provide vehicles to hundreds of civil servants, including the fuel to run them. The government, he said, ""cannot abandon the old habits. The [structural adjustment program] is not doing enough."" Try telling that to ordinary Zambians, for whom the end of price controls has meant a 40-fold increase in the price of maize over the past few years. Seventy percent of all Zambians live in poverty. Infant mortality is up, and adult life expectancy is down -- defying the trend in most of the rest of the world. The despair of ordinary Zambians will likely translate into widespread apathy, predicted Sichone. Or it could leave some voters longing for what seemed the good old days of Kaunda. The choice facing Zambians, said a former Zambian diplomat, may lead to the same end. If the economy continues to decline in the face of structural adjustments, eventually mass uprisings will occur. And if Kaunda wins and returns to the policies of the past, and international lenders pull out and stop propping up the economy, the same anger may explode. ""We do have a serious political crisis,"" the diplomat said. ""People are starving. It is tough. And frankly, I don't know how much longer it can go on."""9-Apr-95,,"Count the white faces in the boardrooms of the sleek skyscrapers, on the verandas of the gracious sports clubs and around the tables of the chic restaurants. Then submit to a pop history quiz: Who won the liberation war, anyway? Blacks did. But 15 years after Rhodesia became Zimbabwe and the second-to-last bastion of white-minority rule in sub-Saharan Africa vanished, it's easy to be confused. Whites, who make up less than 1 percent of Zimbabwe's population, own an estimated 97 percent of the private wealth here. By many standards, they are living better than ever. Meanwhile, the black masses disproportionately bear the burden of a rising unemployment rate, now at 25 percent, steep inflation, punishing droughts and deep cuts in social spending. The tenacity of white economic domination in the teeth of black political empowerment offers what some here regard as a cautionary tale for Zimbabwe's neighbor to the south. ""If our pattern holds in South Africa 15 years from now, there's going to be trouble -- and I doubt it will wait 15 years to break out,"" said John Makumbe, a professor of political science at the University of Zimbabwe. ""They have a much more entrenched culture of protest than we do. Our political culture is docile."" Certainly Zimbabwe's politics proved docile last week. Voters went to the polls yesterday and today for their fourth parliamentary election since independence in 1980. Despite the mounting economic woes of the masses, President Robert Mugabe's ruling party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, is predicted to win all but a handful of the 150 seats against weak and divided opposition. The party currently holds 147. The only mystery of this election is the turnout. Critics such as Makumbe and a host of human rights groups accuse Mugabe's party of rigging electoral laws, intimidating political opponents, stifling free debate and allowing corrupt government ministers to plunder the treasury and forge cozy alliances with white business. Despite news media that are largely government controlled, these accusations have circulated widely among Zimbabwe's well-educated population of 11 million. Yet they have triggered only episodic racial tension and no discernible political reform movement. Indeed, many black Zimbabweans count their blessings. Politics are stable, racial tensions are low, and ethnic violence has been nonexistent since a post-independence tribal war led to a coalition government incorporating the Shona and Ndebele tribes. On the economic front, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank have prevailed upon the government to adopt an economic structural adjustment program. Its initials, ESAP, and its effects, have spawned the rueful nickname Ever-Suffering African People. Despite the short-term pain, however, it gives the economy a chance to climb out of an investment-stifling debt trap. ""Zimbabweans take the long view -- the work we have to do in terms of black economic empowerment, we have forever,"" said Strive Masiyiwa, a black businessmen who runs an electrical engineering company. ""We know what war has done elsewhere in Africa. As long as we have peace and stability, we know our sons will bear the economic fruits of our political liberation."" Not all blacks are as patient. ""There is going to be a lot of noise, consumer boycotts and street protest after the election,"" predicted Phillip Chiyangwa, president of the Affirmation Active Group, which has been pressing the government to change the rules of the economic game here to favor black businesses. That process is known in Zimbabwe as the ""indigenization"" of the private sector. Since 1990 -- after Mugabe's government began to deemphasize socialist ideology -- the concept has received a great deal of official lip service. So far, black businessmen say it's all talk. They say they are as hobbled as ever by 35 percent interest rates and by banks that march to the tune of the multinational corporations that own them. Laws designed to funnel government contracts to black companies are a sham, said Masiyiwa. And the hope that privatization of state-owned utilities would produce black owners has proven illusory. The most contentious issue is rural land ownership. About 4,000 white farmers own roughly 30 percent of Zimbabwe's best farmland; on it, they produce virtually all of Zimbabwe's commercial crops. Seven million blacks live on farmland hardest hit by drought and have trouble eking out a subsistence. Land was the driving issue behind the guerrilla war that toppled Ian Smith's white-minority government in 1980. Blacks forced to relocate during a century of white settlement yearned to till the same soil their forefathers did. The Mugabe government's first wave of postwar land redistribution was a bust. In 1992 the government passed a law allowing it to appropriate -- with compensation -- the land of commercial farmers for resettlement purposes, triggering great fears in the white community. But so far, said Peter MacSporran, president of the Commercial Farmers' Union, not a single commercial farmer has been forced to sell his land against his will. ""After an initial period of confrontation, we're working well with the government to identify suitable land for resettlement,"" he said. Despite the drought, commercial farmers have reasons to breathe easily these days. The economic liberalization of IMF structural adjustment has meant fewer hassles with government marketing boards, more access to customers abroad and a wider range of imported equipment to purchase. ""Five years ago, if you wanted a tractor here, you were looking at a three-year wait,"" said MacSporran. ""Now, you go to the dealer and he asks, 'What color do you want?' "" The dozen-plus skyscrapers built in Harare in the last five years, which give this capital city the most impressive skyline in sub-Saharan Africa, stand as a vote of confidence by the multinationals in the long-term future of the economy. The vast majority of the white-collar workers in these office towers are blacks who took advantage of the Mugabe government's investment in black education to become clerks, accountants, salesmen, middle-level managers. But there aren't nearly enough jobs. With the official unemployment rate running at 25 percent -- unofficial estimates say it is closer to 40 percent -- Zimbabwe has the dubious distinction of housing the best-educated unemployed work force in Africa. Young blacks appear to be getting discouraged. With no jobs available for high school graduates, and with the government having to impose new school fees to satisfy IMF demands to end budgetary deficits, the school dropout rate has doubled in a decade. All of this seems to be a recipe for unrest. And for a brief stretch late last year and early this year, as the country headed toward this election, there was a sharp rise in anti-white protests. A handful of militant black college students vandalized some downtown clubs and restaurants that whites frequent. The government newspaper carried angry anti-white letters to the editor and anonymous ads that called for the expulsion within a decade of all of Zimbabwe's 80,000 whites -- down from a peak of 270,000 before independence. But as suddenly as the campaign began, it ended. In mid-January, after passions had come to a boil with the conviction of a white doctor for using his black patients as guinea pigs in medical experiments, the government-controlled Herald newspaper announced it would no longer accept letters that inflamed racial passions. A big anti-white rally fizzled. The widespread assumption, said Makumbe, is that Mugabe's government played the anti-white card to divert attention from its own failings. Then when international lending institutions and multinational corporations put out the word that enough was enough, the campaign folded. That explanation may be a bit simplistic. But there's no denying that, 15 years after liberation, Zimbabwe is run by a sometimes stormy marriage of a white economic and black political elite. Even without black ownership of the private sector, there's a big enough patronage base in the civil service and parastatal companies, which together account for about 35 percent of the economy, for the Mugabe government to keep a firm grip on power. Ministers get rich, political opponents get weary, the masses get poorer. The country is stable. Might the same arrangement evolve in South Africa? Comparisons are risky. There are 80,000 whites here; 5 million there. South Africa's economy is 15 times bigger than Zimbabwe's. Race relations have always had a harder edge in South Africa. The black masses there are more urbanized and politicized, and there is a much quicker trigger for violence. But there's one compelling similarity. These are two countries where a small minority of whites own the economy and a large majority of blacks own the politics. It is an inherently unstable arrangement, and so far there's only been one model for achieving stability. It's the Zimbabwean model."10-Jul-94,,"The once elegant, European-style boulevards of this capital are overrun with debris. Largely abandoned government buildings are obscured behind elephant grass and overgrown trees. In a perverse reversal of the usual development maxim, an opulent colonial capital is being overtaken by the bush. Kinshasa was carved out of the jungle. Now the jungle is coming to claim the land back. As sub-Saharan Africa struggles to find stability in the 1990s, Zaire offers a poignant -- and ominous -- lesson. Unlike Somalia and Liberia, this big, rich country has not collapsed into civil war. It has not, like tiny Rwanda, imploded after a brutal campaign of tribal slaughter. But Zaire, the region's second-largest country and one of its potentially wealthiest, is equally desperate: It has crumbled from official corruption and greed, incompetence, neglect and decay. The institutions that once defined the Zairian state have all ceased to function. Civil servants and teachers are not paid, roads and bridges are left in disrepair, public hospitals are not supplied, the public telephone system has disintegrated. Child malnutrition is on the rise, and the country is ravaged by AIDS and a rebirth of sleeping sickness that has caused entire villages simply to lie down and die. ""Precolonial"" is how one Western resident described Zaire. ""It's like Europe in the Dark Ages,"" said another Westerner, a diplomat with long experience here. ""Zaire just proves that societies don't depend on the existence of a state. Societies can function on their own."" While the causes of Zaire's crisis may be distinct -- and the extent of its free fall extreme -- this country in many ways stands as a microcosm of what many Africans and others say is a continent-wide phenomenon. Since the United States and the Soviet Union ended a rivalry that shaped the politics of sub-Saharan Africa through much of the last 30 years, the region has struggled to find a new basis for stability and development free of foreign tutelage. Some progress has been made. But governments, economies and even whole countries artificially forged by European colonizers in the 19th century, and propped up since achieving independence a generation ago by the patronage of outside powers, are beginning to fragment. Like most countries of the developing world, and in the former communist bloc of Eastern Europe, African states have tried to adopt the non-communist world's formula for success. Most have pledged to open their economies and adopt free-market policies, and many have begun talking about giving up autocracy or one-party rule for democracy and pluralism. A few -- most famously South Africa -- have succeeded. Yet as much of the rest of the Third World appears poised to enter a new era of rapid economic growth and stability, Africa is still struggling to shake off the burdens of the past, ranging from the borders drawn by the European powers to the corruption and economic mismanagement engendered by post-colonial dictators backed by Moscow, Washington, Paris or Beijing. In many places, the old order is crumbling but nothing is taking its place. ""There's too much talk about development and not enough about decay,"" said Peter Lyon at London's Institute for Commonwealth Studies. Zaire, he said, ""may be the classic case.""  Obstacles Old and New For two years, Zaire for all practical purposes has had no working government. Its longtime president, Mobutu Sese Seko, has been abandoned by the United States, his backer during the Cold War, and no longer can impose order on his sprawling country. But his political opponents have been too weak to remove him. There are two competing prime ministers, neither of whose authority is accepted by the army or the bureaucracy. Soldiers have destroyed much of the infrastructure of the capital in riots over pay, and whole regions populated by distinct ethnic groups have simply taken over their own affairs. For some Africans, the crisis reflects fundamental problems of statehood that have lingered in African countries since they gained independence in the 1960s. ""It raises profound questions about the nature of these governments and the nature of these states,"" said Rakiya Omaar, a Somali who is co-director of African Rights, a London-based human rights group. ""The problem in Africa has been these predatory, strong central governments that never cared about their own people."" Similar political breakdowns are happening around the region. Somalia has not had a government since its U.S.-backed dictator, Mohamed Siad Barre, was chased out of power in January 1991. Liberia is still in the throes of an on-again, off-again civil war over who, and what, should replace the late Samuel Doe's dictatorship. Angola and Sudan both seem hopelessly locked in civil wars that have effectively divided those countries along geographic lines. And Rwanda, Zaire's neighbor, has been in a state of anarchy and civil war since April 6, with no effective government in place, since President Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in an unexplained plane crash. Other countries, from Sierra Leone to Uganda, from Ethiopia to Mali, are waging small-scale wars against guerrillas, ethnic separatists or armed bandits that have made large chunks of territory impassable and lawless. One key cause of this turmoil is Africa's loss of what was arguably its most important resource: its relevance. During the Cold War, the continent was a playground for the proxy conflicts. The Americans, the Soviets, the Chinese, the Israelis, the Arabs, white South Africans, white Rhodesians, even the Taiwanese searched for allies and brought in aid, arms and advice. Much of the attention lavished on Africa proved destructive -- fueling civil wars, as in Angola, or backing dictators, as in Somalia, Liberia and Zaire. But the outside attention also meant that highways were built, hospitals were kept supplied and a generation of Africa's elite were given access to education at home and abroad. African autocrats were able to play East against West, Arabs against Israelis, Chinese against Taiwanese in a bid for foreign largesse. The game was always to find who would give the most aid, and some despots played it deftly. With the end of the East-West conflict, the dismantling of South Africa's racist policies of apartheid and the move toward peace in the Middle East, Africa has become more marginalized than at any time since Europeans first set foot here 500 years ago. Zaire tells the story: After years in which the United States, France and Belgium lavished aid on Mobutu, almost all foreign assistance has been cut since 1990, and most expatriate workers have departed. In June, Zaire was expelled from the International Monetary Fund. The lack of foreign interest and investment, combined with the difficulty of implementing new economic and political models, means that even outside war zones, Africans are struggling to come to terms with longstanding social and economic ailments: # According to the World Bank, the four poorest countries in the world, in terms of gross national product, are in Africa; seven of the world's 10 poorest countries are in Africa. From 1980 until 1991, African economies actually shrank an average of 1.2 percent each year, meaning Africans have gotten poorer over the last decade. # African countries have the world's highest illiteracy rates, and they put the least public money per pupil into their education systems. # Agricultural production has declined in most African countries over the last two decades, leaving Africa less able to feed itself and more dependent on foreign food aid. The World Bank estimates it will take 40 years for some African countries just to climb back to their pre-independence level. # Africa is ravaged by disease. AIDS has become the most common cause of death for Africans, and in a dozen African cities, 20 to 30 percent of the adult population is infected with the virus that causes AIDS. More than 10 million of the world's 15 million people infected with the AIDS virus are in Africa. Not all African countries are in a downward spiral. While Angola is in the grip of full-scale civil war, Malawi recently conducted a peaceful election that ousted an entrenched autocrat. The death of the president of Rwanda sparked an explosion of tribal massacres, but the death of the president of Ivory Coast caused barely a political ripple. There are many economic problem areas, but some countries, like Ghana, are on the mend. Still, it is the absence of outright conflict in most African countries that makes their social and economic decline so remarkable. In state after state, public institutions have collapsed, health care has diminished, infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and poverty has deepened -- not because of civil war, but simply because poorly supported, inefficient and sometimes corrupt governments have been unable to manage their countries' daunting problems. In other words, the pattern in Zaire may not be the exception but the rule. ""In Somalia and Liberia, it was violent,"" said a European diplomat in Zaire. ""Here, it's a slow implosion. But the result is the same. Here, it's just crumbled."" The Road to Anarchy Although its descent into near-anarchy was touched off by the end of the Cold War, Zaire's deterioration as a state began shortly after the country gained independence from Belgium in June 1960. An early secessionist movement in the region of Katanga, which provoked U.N. troops to intervene, underscored the fragility -- and artificiality -- of the new nation of 200 separate tribes. Still, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Zaire -- then known as the Congo -- provided Western countries with 69 percent of their industrial diamonds, 49 percent of their cobalt, and other strategic minerals, making it ""a very important piece of real estate,"" according to American University's Sanford J. Ungar in his book, ""Africa."" From that commanding position as a wealthy and strategically important Western supplier, the country entered a long era of Western-backed autocratic rule -- and slow decline. In 1965, army strongman Joseph Desire Mobutu seized power, changing his name and that of his country in an ""Africanization"" campaign. Mobutu personifies the African Big Man, the old-style and outdated autocrat who rules more like a traditional tribal chieftain. Over almost three decades with Mobutu at the helm, Zaire suffered from extraordinary mismanagement and corruption. Hundreds of millions of dollars of export earnings from state-run mining corporations literally disappeared -- presumably into the overseas bank accounts of Mobutu and his family members, and also to support the lavish but unaccounted-for spending projects of the office of the presidency. Mobutu's well-documented corruption and his heavy-handedness with opponents brought frequent rebukes from Washington and his European patrons. But from the first Congo crisis of the Kennedy administration, which saw Africa becoming a battleground between East and West, Mobutu proved a valuable Cold War ally to the United States. And Washington's financial and political support kept Mobutu in power. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the withdrawal of Cuban troops from neighboring Angola, however, the United States no longer had a strategic interest in propping up Zaire's dictator. And like Zambia's Kenneth Kaunda, Kenya's Daniel arap Moi and Malawi's H. Kamuzu Banda, Mobutu was forced to relent to mounting pressure for change. Zaire for a time looked as if it might be on the path to pluralism. In 1992, a national conference stripped Mobutu of much of his power, appointed staunch Mobutu opponent Etienne Tshisekedi as prime minister and even changed the country's name back to Congo in a direct slap at Mobutu. The conference -- made up of politicians, civic leaders, intellectuals and clerics -- voted to make all of its decisions binding and replaced the old Mobutu-dominated parliament as the supreme lawmaking body. What the conferees apparently never counted on was that Mobutu would simply ignore their edicts and continue to govern as he pleased, keeping personal control of the nation's money supply through the central bank and using freshly minted cash to keep his elite presidential guard paid and loyal. What has developed over the last two years has been a kind of bizarre shadow play. Mobutu ""fired"" Tshisekedi as prime minister, then concocted a new convention to choose a replacement, Faustin Birindwa, a Mobutu ally. But Tshisekedi refused to relinquish his title, giving the country two claimants to the position, neither of whom has any resources or real power. Government offices shut their doors, unable to function without cash. Cabinet ministers stayed home. The country ground slowly to a halt. With the country sinking into ruin, weary national conference delegates -- their numbers now swollen with Mobutu supporters -- voted in June for yet another prime minister, Kengo wa Dondo, who had more legitimate anti-Mobutu credentials but still was rejected by some elements of the opposition. Various Western embassies tried to persuade Tshisekedi and his rivals to unify, but to no avail. The latest convention has promised presidential elections next year. Many Zairians and Western diplomats predict that, with the opposition divided and squabbling, Mobutu will likely win, whether he rigs the elections or not. And that, they say, is a likely formula for continued national stagnation and disintegration. ""Things are getting worse and worse,"" said Eugene Nzila, a physician whose AIDS research project has crumbled to virtually nothing because the country's continuing paralysis forced foreign donors to withdraw funding. ""It's basically a political situation,"" he said, reflecting the frustration of many Zairians. ""There's nothing we can do but wait.""  Surviving by Skimming If Zaire can be seen as a microcosm of Africa, then Ndili International Airport might be seen as a microcosm of Zaire. Upon arriving at the airport, a passenger is immediately greeted by a dizzying array of soldiers and police, hustlers, deal makers, facilitators, money changers, customs inspectors, health inspectors, drivers, shoeshine boys, baggage handlers and just plain hangers-on. Each claims to have some official service to perform -- checking your vaccination card, searching your luggage -- and each demands to be paid ""service"" -- a price that can range anywhere from a few pennies in local currency to $ 20. Official services at the airport have broken down; no one has gotten a paycheck in at least six months. But working at the airport can still prove lucrative for the amount of money that can be extorted or raked off from incoming passengers. There is much jostling, shouting and occasional shoving as everyone takes a turn to perform his task and demand his fee. To cut more easily through the crowd, there are ""facilitators."" Most are uniformed soldiers -- ostensibly, assigned to airport security, in reality soldiers-for-hire. One will attach himself to a passenger, according VIP status; help push through to the front of lines; find the passenger a taxi; even accompany the passenger for the 20-mile trip into town ""for security."" The price: $ 100 all-inclusive, including cab fare. ""You can pay the colonel, you can pay the soldiers,"" said a European diplomat. ""And it's a good thing. Those guys are being fed. They sleep well, they eat well, their families are fed."" That kind of chaotic, anything-goes corruption is more evident the farther one ventures from Kinshasa, as the ""privatization"" of government services and the irrelevance of the central government become even more pronounced. The small border outpost of Uvira, on Zaire's eastern border with Burundi, is about as far from Kinshasa as possible, in every way. The border post still has immigration controls, customs controls, police controls and every other conceivable type of government authority. But the corruption -- if it can still be called that in a place with no official rules -- has become a means of survival for public servants with no other means of income except whatever can be extorted from travelers. Thus, there is the $ 20 fee for each person crossing the border, plus an extra $ 20 for each car. There is a Transportation Ministry desk that charges a $ 10 ""tax"" for use of the road. The Health Ministry charges $ 20 -- or whatever can be negotiated -- as its price of entrance. And there are the police manning roadblocks along the way out of town, also demanding ""service"" to allow passage. By becoming more or less financially self-sufficient, such isolated east Zairian towns have maintained some semblance of public order -- while at the same time becoming less tied to Kinshasa. In Goma, for example, local merchants have joined together to make sure the military is kept paid, preventing the kind of bloody soldier riots that wracked Kinshasa in 1991 and 1993. ""It's all localized,"" said a diplomat, using the analogy of Europe's Dark Ages. ""Think of it as castles along the Rhine in the year 900, where everyone exacted a tax or toll."" This kind of de facto decentralization -- growing regional autonomy and independence -- is in evidence elsewhere, an outgrowth not of any planned attempts to disperse power but rather the natural evolution of weak central governments that can no longer provide needed services to their outlying areas. In war-torn Angola, Somalia and Liberia, central governments can no longer claim to control much beyond their capitals. In large countries such as Nigeria and Ethiopia, government edicts are becoming less relevant. Even relatively stable Tanzania is now having to deal with growing calls for independence from the island of Zanzibar, which is finding union with the mainland irrelevant. ""These countries are artificial,"" said Michael Chege, a Kenyan scholar at Harvard University. ""They have to be. What else do you do, with all these tribes and linguistic groups and so on? ... We might have to consider adjusting boundaries -- or at least put it on the agenda."" About The Series With the end of the Cold War, sub-Saharan Africa ceased to be the prize for which East and West had vied over decades. In the 1990s, the region's 45 governments are trying to make their own way in a changing world, grappling with new political and economic systems that are often at odds with centuries-old traditions and decades-old practices. This occasional series on a continent adrift will look at African successes and failures and their causes. Future stories will address such issues as environmental degradation, economics, health, religion, population growth, ethnic differences and Africa's role in the world."12-Dec-93,,"They call it ""Wall Street,"" and as in its celebrated counterpart in New York bank notes with a face value of hundreds of billions are exchanged daily in what amounts to this country's only truly functioning currency market. Trouble is, most of the money being traded here is virtually worthless. Nothing so unusual about that, a stranger might think, given that Zaire's economy has been virtually bankrupt for nearly a decade, a result of endemic official corruption and monetary ineptitude. Indeed, average real incomes here are now a fraction of what they were in the early 1960's, though under current circumstances comparative statistics, too, are probably worthless. But by any accounting, since mid-October conditions in sub-Saharan Africa's second most populous country have taken a dramatic turn for the worse, a result of what is now widely regarded as a major misstep by Zaire's President, Mobutu Sese Seko, and Prime Minister Faustin Birindwa. For the third time in two years, the Mobutu Government has introduced a new currency in an effort to solve its chronic liquidity crisis. This time, however, it has taken an even more drastic step by trying to withdraw the old bank notes from circulation. But the tactic appears to have backfired, as the new currency has plunged against the dollar on the black market and its circulation has sent prices sharply higher across this huge central African country of 40 million people. 110 Million to the Dollar And the ensuing chaos, foreign diplomats, analysts and many ordinary Zairians say, threatens to plunge the nation into its gravest crisis since the nightmarish turmoil that followed the country's independence from Belgium in 1960. One illustration of how precipitously the economic situation has deteriorated in recent weeks is to compare the value of the national currency, the zaire, against the American dollar. At the beginning of October, the zaire traded at about eight million to the dollar; today, the rate is about 110 million and is still rising. ""Things have gone from the ridiculous to the truly absurd,"" said Atondoko Ngefa, the president of Zaire's Association for the Defense of Human Rights. ""It was hard to believe that things could actually get worse here, but they have."" A Western economist here said: ""Frankly, I haven't the faintest idea of how most people get by. It defies all logic. But eventually, it will all come tumbling down. It must."" Sure of Nothing In Washington, George Moose, the Assistant Secretary for African Affairs, said at a Congressional hearing last month that the Mobutu Government's currency manipulations were ""wrong-headed and could incite a new round of pillaging and military unrest."" Those are the forecasts. But then diplomats, business people and officials also acknowledge they can be sure of nothing. What is most frustrating, analysts and foreign diplomats here say, is that the current crisis was altogether predictable and probably avoidable. In recent years, prices here have risen fortyfold, partly because of a huge budget deficit that developed after the Government abandoned an economic recovery program devised by the International Monetary Fund early in 1990 and increased spending. And with foreign exports, Government revenue and industrial production at record lows, there was nothing to buttress Zaire's money.  At that time, the zaire traded at about 300 to the American dollar, but rapidly depreciated. Since then, vast segments of the economy have shut down. In the stalls of the street markets here, the price of a sack of manioc, Zaire's staple food, has quadrupled. Relief workers report that malnutrition, virtually unknown here until recently, is spreading. And with the price of food beyond the reach of much of the population, there has been a growing exodus from urban areas back into the bush, where food is still plentiful. ""It's all a matter of supply and demand,"" said Peter Rosenblum. a senior lawyer with the Human Rights Law Group, who has written extensively on Zaire. ""Zairians are in terror of the new bills,"" he said. ""They know that each time a new bill is introduced, the old bills become virtually worthless, and inflation takes another galactic leap."" Violence Is Feared There is plenty of evidence, moreover, that if the situation continues to worsen, it could cost the lives of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people through violence it might engender. Indeed, twice in this decade Zairians have suffered through outbreaks of violence and rioting provoked by the Government's ill-advised attempts to introduce new currencies. In July 1991, Zaire Army soldiers mutinied because they had not been paid. A week of looting and violence spread throughout the country, eliminating most of what remained of the modern productive sector, outside of mining. In the Kinshasa area alone, 90,000 jobs were lost and at least 240 people were killed. The rioting also led to the evacuation of virtually all foreign workers -- about 20,000 people, mostly from Belgium, France and the United States.  They included most of the country's university professors, teaching staff at hospitals and geologists in the vital mining industry. Rioting erupted again last February when soldiers discovered that the new five-million-zaire bank notes used to pay them were impossible to spend.  They seized control of the Parliament building and held several hundred lawmakers hostage, demanding that they order local merchants to accept the new bank notes. Hundreds, including the French Ambassador, were killed. Nonetheless, in yet another effort to prop up the economy artificially, on Oct. 22 President Mobutu introduced yet another new currency, with each note supposed to be worth three of the old bills, and set at an official rate of three to the dollar. Traders Are Arrested But traders on Kinshasa's Wall Street, a narrow alley across the road from the United States Embassy here, quickly devalued the old money. The Government first responded by raiding Wall Street, arresting traders and seizing banknotes. But the money changers soon returned. Oto Nbongo, a spokesman for the dealers, told Zaire television that they had come back ""because among the money changers there are fathers and mothers of families who depend on this practice."" Left unsaid, many Zairians say, is that many of the Wall Street traders are relatives of senior Government officials and soldiers who depend on the market for their main source of income. More ominously, the new notes have already caused scattered rioting. In late November, soldiers went on a looting rampage in the central Zaire town of Kananga where opposition parties have been leading a boycott of the currency. Three Roman Catholic priests were reportedly killed in the rampage. In any event, Etienne Tshisekedi, Zaire's main opposition leader, who despite being dismissed by President Mobutu last year still considers himself Prime Minister, has called the new notes a ""criminal swindle."" ""This operation is pure piracy,"" Mr. Tshisekedi told reporters at a news conference, ""The people will agree with me in the end."" Map of Zaire shows the location of Kinshasa."11-Jul-90,,"Hours after security forces routed rioters from the streets of this East African capital Monday night during a third day of civil turmoil, a ragged beggar on an otherwise deserted street repeatedly muttered, ""Nyayo! Nyayo! (Footsteps! Footsteps!)"" the slogan of President Daniel arap Moi's government. Throughout Kenya, the words evoke the aim of following the economic and political path charted by Kenya's founding father and first president, Jomo Kenyatta. But the footsteps here and elsewhere in Africa appear for the moment to be leading in the opposite direction -- down a new road, away from single-party states led by authoritarian rulers. The riots here and the violent clashes that occurred between police and protesters last month in Zambia reflect larger political and economic tensions on the continent as traditional leaders of sub-Saharan Africa struggle to contend with modern demands for change. ""This is not the only place in Africa where this is going on,"" said Smith Hempstone, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya. ""It may mean different things in different places. . . . Some of it seems to be a generalized protest over economic conditions. . . . Some may be a desire for reform of the existing government structure."" In Kenya, the struggle encompasses both. What began with the arrest of political opponents rapidly turned into riots by unemployed young men, many of whom seemed more interested in burning cars, robbing bystanders and throwing stones at police than in forming new political parties. The path of one-party rule blazed by Kenyatta now is accused by domestic and foreign critics of stifling dissent and political freedom. Amid charges of rampant corruption in Kenya's government, the nation is steadily losing foreign investors, and international aid donors have begun a review of some of the nearly $ 1 billion the nation receives each year. Moi's reaction to the criticism has been swift and predictable. Maintaining that single-party rule by the Kenya African National Union is here to stay, the Kenyan ruler ordered political dissidents and opponents jailed and accused foreign governments that expressed concern for human and civil rights here, particularly the United States, of meddling in the nation's affairs. Among those jailed were two former cabinet members, Kenneth Matiba and Charles Rubia. Today, the Moi government sent an even sharper signal when it announced that security forces have been ordered to ""use any force necessary"" to stifle the conflict, which has subsided in Nairobi but reportedly has spread to rural areas. The government reported that 15 people have been killed and 61 injured in violence Moi has attributed to ""hooligans"" and ""drug addicts."" But in a country of almost 24 million people, where unemployment among the young is more than 40 percent and the economy has grown 2.9 percent per year over the last decade while population has risen more than 4 percent annually -- a rate unsurpassed in the world -- popular discontent and desire for change are by no means unique to society's outcasts. Reacting to calls from foreign donors and domestic opponents for economic and political reform, a number of African countries in recent months have announced plans to move from single-party to multi-party political systems. Zaire, Benin, Gabon and Ivory Coast have been in the forefront of those countries promising change, but even impoverished Zambia and war-torn Angola and Somalia have declared their intent to take similar steps. Nigeria's military regime, despite a recent coup attempt, has also insisted that it will keep its promise to return power within two years to democratically elected civilian leaders. In some ways, the avowed changes reflect unlikely attempts by traditional autocratic rulers to fall in step and to compete with democratic transformations occurring elsewhere in the world that are influencing the policies and decisions of aid donors. At a time when democratic values are surging in popularity and the newly liberated nations of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union are beginning to attract increasing shares of the world's limited supply of economic development aid, many analysts feel Kenya's crackdown -- and others like it in Africa -- may be fraught with peril. Western lenders and institutions such as the World Bank, for instance, are emphasizing economic reform and political tolerance in Africa as conditions for assistance. The shift comes after a lost decade of development in the 1980s, when real income for most of the 450 million people of the continent declined. Somalia's longtime ruler, Mohamed Siad Barre, had little choice but to say the Somalia political system will change after donors led by the United States slashed more than $ 100 million in annual economic and military aid in response to widespread human rights abuses. But promising political change and delivering it are two different matters. Siad Barre still controls Somalia tightly and has announced no plans to give up power or to hold elections. Similarly, many political analysts and dissidents in Africa seem skeptical of the sincerity, willingness and ability of Zaire's Mobutu Sese Seko, Felix Houphouet-Boigny of Ivory Coast and Zambia's Kenneth Kaunda -- each of whom has ruled for more than a quarter-century -- to give up power or even allow real opposition. In Zambia, where Kaunda last month scheduled an October referendum for the people to decide whether they want more than one political party, many already have expressed skepticism about whether the poll will be fair. Kaunda has turned down demands by dissidents that the United Nations supervise the referendum. While opponents of single-party rule have been refused permission to campaign for the vote, Kaunda has recently taken to the stump to get out the single-party vote. When asked if he planned to vote in the referendum, one young Zambian man said no. ""I believe in multi-party,"" he said, insisting that the October vote will be rigged. The turmoil that has swept Africa suggests that when governments come to grips with the two-fisted demands for political and economic changes, the latter fist packs the bigger punch. Sharp increases in government spending and other austerity measures encouraged by foreign lenders and the International Monetary Fund have inspired protests, riots and strikes in numerous African countries. In Ivory Coast, Houphouet-Boigny was forced to consider political changes only when he was faced with a series of critical strikes by public service workers demanding back pay and wage increases. Likewise, Kaunda set the referendum date for multi-party rule only after demonstrators violently protested a doubling of the price of cornmeal by the government. The increase was part of a series of IMF-style economic reforms that included other austerity measures. However, Roger Chongwe, a Zambian human rights lawyer, mirrored the assessment of many advocates of political change in Lusaka when he described the food-price increases and the resulting riots that claimed at least 23 lives as ""a tragedy of one-party government."" ""We need to restructure the economy and make cuts in the budget, certainly,"" he said. ""But it was not accidental that these cuts were made in food subsidies and not in the public funds spent to support the ruling party."" Whether economic travail in Kenya will ever lead to political liberalization remains to be seen. But Moi is adamant in opposition to change. He has long insisted that political openness would inevitably lead to tribal factionalism, separatism and violence and ruin Kenya's stability. The consequences of such civil strife seem more than evident on the other coast of Africa, in Liberia, where tribal passions swirl amid that nation's bloody rebellion. But just as President Samuel K. Doe's decade of repression failed to stamp out simmering frictions between various ethnic groups in Liberia, Moi's brand of autocracy may similarly fail to bury cultural pluralism in Kenya or avoid its consequences."26-Mar-90,,"Not since the early days of independence in the 1960s has French-speaking Africa experienced such buffeting, with anti-government demonstrations erupting recently in half a dozen capitals from Dakar on the continent's westernmost bulge to Libreville nearly 2,000 miles east on the equator. Single-party governments -- civilian or military, socialist or capitalist -- are paying the price of neglected agriculture, official corruption, failed economic development, runaway birth rates and rampant human-rights violations. Throughout French-speaking West Africa, long unchallenged administrations have fired ministers, be they scapegoats or scoundrels, and sought other ways to pacify populations who feel it is unfair that they, and not their leaders, are being asked to pay the price of their governments' failures. As the squeeze of austerity measures tightens, resentment is letting loose restiveness. The anti-government demonstrations in these sun-baked lands come in the shadow of changing Eastern Europe. Many young African protesters, inspired by television footage showing East European crowds demonstrating against communism, are seeking to emulate the success of Poles, Hungarians, East Germans, Czechoslovaks, Bulgarians and Romanians in shucking unpopular one-party governments and demanding multi-party democracy. In an interview, Laurent Nbagbo, a dissident and university professor, talked recently of the ills that afflict his native Ivory Coast, which he described as ""just another failed African country subject to nepotism and corruption shared with other one-party regimes."" While his remarks were aimed at Ivory Coast, their sentiments are echoed in other countries in West Africa, as is his prescription: ""Only free, multi-party elections will provide the new legitimacy the country needs to solve the crisis."" Just as the cry for change has been the same in these countries, so too has the government response: generally, a resounding ""no,"" reverberating through clouds of tear gas.In Gabon, President Omar Bongo clamped a curfew on the country's main oil town of Port-Gentil on Saturday night after rioting and looting erupted there. Gatherings of more than five people were also banned. The curfew was to continue yesterday. Since December, Bongo, who has ruled since 1967, has been confronted with strikes opposing austerity measures and student protests demanding political reforms. Government and bank employees went on strike and blocked roads last week in Libreville, the capital. The disturbances led Bongo in late February to rename his Democratic Party, and call a national conference to discuss political and economic changes. But opposition groups, who want multi-party democracy and more respect for individual freedoms, have complained about their representation at the conference. They are threatening to pull out of the talks and call a general strike if they are not allowed more delegates by Tuesday. In Ivory Coast, workers and students recently took to the streets in Abidjan, the capital, to demonstrate their anger at the government, which has demanded austerity but done nothing to punish an increasingly corrupt ruling elite. The protests were met by tear gas, stun grenades and truncheons. President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who has ruled since independence in 1960, has rejected protesters' demands for multi-party democracy. The opposition has accused Houphouet-Boigny and some of his powerful government ministers, past and present, of having hidden away in Europe sums said to exceed the foreign aid that Western donors have poured into Ivory Coast, long the showcase of free enterprise in Africa. In Niger, a poor landlocked state, security forces in the capital, Niamey, opened fire and killed at least 11 demonstrators who were protesting austerity measures that reduced scholarships and other subsidies for university students. Niger's president, Gen. Ali Saibou, last month blamed the disturbances on ""a small group of malcontents . . . plotting to destablize and throw [Niger] into chaos."" He promised a new constitution, but it would allow only one political party, he said. In Guinea, school teachers, once the vanguard of the radical revolution of late president Sekou Toure, recently went on strike in Conakry, the capital, for more pay from the military government of Gen. Lansana Conte, struggling to undo Toure's legacy of economic waste and realize the country's proven mineral and agricultural potential. In Benin, a tiny Marxist state, rioters late last month stoned a statue of Lenin in Porto Novo, the capital, and burned photos of President Mathieu Kerekou, who has been in power since 1972. After France withdrew budget support that had been buttressing bankrupt Benin, Kerekou renounced Marxism and called a national conference last month. But when delegates demanded that he resign, Kerekou burst into tears and accused them of ""attempting a civilian coup."" Now, former politicians long out of favor are sharing power with the president. In Senegal, whose capital, Dakar, once ruled over all French West Africa, cracked sidewalks and empty shops ring the imposing Place de l'Independance as visible reminders of the strain of maintaining post-imperial splendor at a time of growing political street violence. In these and other African countries, secondary and university students are leading the charge for change. Some African governments have spent impressive sums on education, but for many of the thousands of graduates, a diploma led only to a guaranteed civil service job, not to a desired position in the private sector. With the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund demanding that African governments cut back featherbedded payrolls in return for future aid, the young feel they have been educated for nothing. Said one Senegalese official: ""They've shown up for the formal ball just when the lights were being turned off. No wonder they blame those in place for stealing their future."" Tolerance of widespread human-rights violations is also wearing thin among a population sickened by routine police brutality, censorship and other restrictions on free expression. According to Amnesty International, the London-based human-rights monitoring group, human-rights abuses persisted in many of these countries in 1988, the last year for which reports were available. In Guinea, for example, there were a number of political arrests, and those detained were held incommunicado without charge or trial and reportedly subjected to frequent beatings, Amnesty said. In Benin, at least 80 prisoners of conscience remained in detention without trial and there were new arrests of nonviolent government critics. Political detainees were tortured and one died, apparently as a result, according to Amnesty. Adding to the travail of African governments is growing resentment among their educated citizens of corrupt politicians accused of having transferred into Swiss bank accounts or Paris property sizable proportions of French and other foreign aid meant for economic development. In a recent article in the Paris newspaper Le Monde, a specialist on French-speaking Africa asserted that in 1988 the Banque de France, which controls most central banks in the region, bought back $ 1.6 billion in banknotes, ""mostly smuggled out in suitcases and the diplomatic pouch,"" he said. ""Every franc we give impoverishes Africa, comes back to France, or is smuggled into Switzerland and even Japan,"" he wrote. For all these evils, multi-party democracy is being advanced by more and more people as the remedy, despite many African leaders' misgivings about what they claim is its inapplicability in societies with many tribes. In a multi-party democracy carried to the extreme, these one-party leaders argue, each tribe would create its own party. Adherents of this view point to Senegal, which has experimented with multi-party democracy for more than a decade, only to be plagued by a wave of often violent political demonstrations in the two years since President Abdou Diouf's reelection. But advocates of democracy note that before independence, French Africa had multi-party politics without drastic consequences."18-Mar-90,,"Once the success story of West Africa, Ivory Coast is awash in debt, burdened by a bankrupt economy and governed by an octogenarian leader accused of corruption. Its long optimistic citizens fear their country may collapse, and diplomats worry that much of the region could be hurt in the wreckage. ""The old man,"" as President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, 84, is called, is outwardly unperturbed by angry street demonstrators who, for the first time in his half-century in politics, have accused him of corruption and demanded that he retire. The president, who has ruled since independence from France in 1960, told French reporters last week that he will soon designate an heir apparent but did not say he would share power with him. Houphouet-Boigny has rejected protesters' calls to abolish his one-party presidential system and allow a multi-party democracy. In the early years of independence, Ivory Coast economically outdistanced its richer neighbors, Ghana and Guinea, producing diversified cash crops ranging from coffee and cocoa to cotton, rubber, bananas and other tropical fruits. Modest amounts of oil were discovered. The country became the world's leading cocoa producer and the fourth largest coffee exporter. Millions of skilled and unskilled foreign workers -- accounting for perhaps half the country's 11 million population -- poured in to do farm work, drive taxis and run machines, and, over the years, their remittances have kept other millions afloat back home in Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal, Guinea, Liberia, Ghana and beyond. The prospect of Ivorian economic collapse, according to diplomats, economists and politicians, could set off a ripple effect with severe negative economic, social and political repercussions beyond Ivory Coast's borders. In retrospect, danger signals were flying by the late 1970s. Buoyed by high prices for coffee and cocoa, which accounted for more than half of Ivorian exports, giant state-dominated enterprises were founded, their rolls padded with extra workers -- university graduates and unskilled laborers alike -- to provide more jobs and prevent unemployment. On an optimistic evaluation of the economy, French and other Western banks lent Ivory Coast $ 10 billion. Foreign debt now totals $ 14.5 billion with arrears, since payments were stopped in 1987 because of steep, enduring plunges of world coffee and cocoa prices. Houphouet-Boigny cut farmers' guaranteed government payments for their crops by 50 percent in October. For two years, however, he had ignored calls to make such ""a brutal cut,"" as he called it last week, despite five years of overproduction. Similarly, the president until last month refused demands by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to cut the state budget by $ 450 million to obtain fresh loans. Bankers suggested he has compounded the economic crisis by such delaying tactics. For Ivorians, who are not used to economic hardship, the next three to five years are likely to be difficult, according to specialists. On Thursday, the government announced salary and benefits cuts of 8 to 17 percent for government workers earning more than $ 350 a month, 25 percent for legislators and 40 percent for cabinet ministers and presidents of state-owned companies. Private-sector workers will be forced to pay a ""solidarity tax"" of between 5 and 10 percent of their salaries. ""These measures have caused us much pain . . . . We cry with you in these sad and hard times,"" Houphouet-Boigny said in a televised address. ""But if we do not take these measures, in four or five months . . . we will not be able to pay salaries."" But critics of the president and his policies have charged that ""these sad and hard times"" were caused in part by official corruption and that a crackdown would reduce the sacrifice being asked of salaried workers. Computer printouts of 80,000 tax dodgers are said to be circulating in the Ivorian capital. Protesters have demanded that past and present government ministers return any ill-gotten gains, and Houphouet-Boigny himself has been the target of accusations. He is said to have spent $ 150 million on a Roman Catholic basilica in his hometown of Yamoussoukro, and to be harboring a fortune in overseas banks. Laurent Nbagbo, a university history researcher and longtime dissident, insists that Ivory Coast, despite its past success, ""is just another failed African country subject to nepotism and corruption shared with other one-party regimes. ""Only free, multi-party elections,"" he said in an interview, ""will provide the new legitimacy the country needs to solve the crisis."""31-May-88,,"Siaka Stevens, 82, who led this West African nation for 17 years before retiring as president in 1985, died May 29 at his home here. He had a stroke in December that paralyzed the right side of his body, and he lapsed into a coma last week. He became prime minister of Sierra Leone in 1968 after a military coup and assumed the presidency on April 21, 1971, two days after Sierra Leone became a republic. He retired as president in November 1985. At the 1985 conference of the All Peoples Congress Party, he persuaded other presidential hopefuls to stand down in favor of Maj. Gen. Joseph Momoh, a 48-year-old soldier. Momoh's election as party leader was seen as a triumph for Mr. Stevens. On a continent where leaders normally hold power for life or until ousted by force, Mr. Stevens was only the fourth black African head of state to retire from office. President Leopold Senghor of Senegal, who led his West African nation to independence from France in 1960, resigned in 1981. Amadou Ahidjo resigned as president of Cameroon in 1982 after governing for the first 22 years of independence. Julius Nyerere of Tanzania retired as president in 1985, just days ahead of Stevens, after 24 years in office. Momoh took over in November 1985 in a rare smooth transfer of power but in March 1987 faced an unsuccessful coup attempt involving Vice President Francis Minah. Mr. Stevens was briefly put under house arrest but denied any involvement in the plot. Minah and 15 other people were sentenced to death but have not been executed pending appeals before the nation's high court. During his presidency, Mr. Stevens worked to bolster Sierra Leone's image abroad, cultivating good relations with neighbors Guinea and Liberia and serving as chairman of the Organization of African Unity from June 1980 to July 1981. At home, financial problems, worsened by corruption, forced Mr. Stevens to adopt austere economic policies, which he termed ""political suicide,"" that were recommended by the International Monetary Fund. Minerals, principally diamonds, account for more than half of the nation's exports. But, with diamond smuggling endemic, foreign exchange earnings were badly hit. At the same time, import costs, particularly for oil, rose sharply, causing balance of payments problems and budget deficits. In foreign affairs, Mr. Stevens was a critic of South Africa's apartheid. He established diplomatic relations with China, North Korea, Cuba and other communist countries. He also gave financial backing to African liberation movements while pursuing a moderate, pro-Western policy. Mr. Stevens was born at Tolobu, in the southern Moyamba district, on Aug. 24, 1905. He joined the colonial police force in 1923. Seven years later, he joined the Sierra Leone Development Company, a subsidiary of the British firm William Baird, which then had a monopoly in the country's iron resources. Concerned over African miners' working conditions, Mr. Stevens organized the United Mine Workers' Union in 1943 and became its first secretary-general. He was a local councilor and was appointed as a workers representative in Sierra Leone's protectorate assembly set up in 1945. In 1953, he became minister of Lands, Mines and Labor but lost his assembly seat in the 1957 general election. He was expelled from the People's National Party and set up his own party, the All Peoples Congress. In the first post-independence elections in 1962, Mr. Stevens, a persuasive speaker, became opposition leader in parliament. Elected to the influential post of Freetown mayor in 1964, he led the All Peoples Congress to a convincing win in the 1967 election. He was appointed prime minister but almost immediately was put under house arrest by the then army chief, Brig. David Lansana, who declared martial law. He returned as prime minister in April 1968. His early administration was plagued by violence. In 1971, there were two unsuccessful assassination attempts against him. The same year Sierra Leone became a republic and Stevens its president. In 1978 parliament passed a bill allowing one-party rule, later supported by a referendum. In June 1978, Stevens was sworn in for seven years under the new system. He once said: ""Like the United Nations, I have achieved quite a lot in staying alive."""2-Jan-84,,"A Nigerian Army general announced today that he had assumed authority in the aftermath of the military overthrow of the country's civilian Government on Saturday. Speaking on a Nigerian radio broadcast monitored here, Maj. Gen. Mohammed Buhari said the new ''federal military Government'' had taken over ''to save this nation from imminent collapse.'' He said that Nigerians had been living under ''difficult and degrading conditions.'' The general, who served as Oil Minister in Nigeria in the 1970's and most recently commanded an armored division, said that ''after due consultation among the services of the armed forces,'' he had been ''formally invested with authority as the head of the federal military Government and the Commander in Chief of the armed forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.'' 'Call to National Duty' ''It is with humility and deep sense of responsibility that I accepted this challenge and call to national duty,'' he said. Another radio broadcast from Lagos, the Nigerian capital, monitored here, said that the country's military chiefs of staff and the inspector general of police had ''voluntarily resigned'' and that each of the country's 19 states would be under the control of a military governor.  ''Corrupt and inept leadership is the source of immorality and impropriety in our society,'' General Buhari said in his address. ''We shall remain here and salvage the country together,'' he declared. The general's radio speech was repeated at 30-minute intervals on the state radio network, with martial music interspersed. Since Saturday, when the elected Government of President Shehu Shagari was toppled, Nigeria's airports, seaports and border posts have been sealed, a curfew has been in effect and most telephone and telex communication has been cut off. Ban on Political Parties In earlier radio broadcasts that were monitored here, Brig. Saleh Abacha, commander of a mechanized infantry brigade near Lagos, announced suspension of Nigeria's four-year-old Constitution and the banning of all political parties. President Shagari was toppled two days after announcing an austerity budget that reflected the 50 percent drop in the nation's oil revenues since 1981. Nigeria is the second largest supplier of oil to the United States. The whereabouts of Mr. Shegari remained unknown, a Nigerian diplomat said here. Reports from Europe that he had been arrested could not be confirmed. Vice President Alex Ekwueme and several other members of the Shagari administration are reported to have been arrested and all officials of the former Government, both elected and appointed, ordered to report to the police. Diplomats who have managed to communicate with people in Nigeria say that the situation inside the country still appeared to be calm and that there have been no signs of resistance so far. But radio broadcasts have warned that anyone ''disturbing the peace'' would be ''summarily'' dealt with. The United States State Department said Saturday that it appeared that the 7,000 Americans known to be in the country were safe. The Nigerian press agency said that at Minna, in the central state of Kaduna, political party emblems were reported to have been torn down and ''persons unknown'' had burned pictures of the civilian governor, Alhaji Awwal Ibrahi. The agency said that truckloads of armed troops were patrolling Minna and that Governor Ibrahi had ''packed out'' - apparently disappeared - with his senior aides. President Shagari was elected to a second term in office last August. In the three months since his inauguration, he had selected a new Cabinet composed largely of technocrats and had promised to reduce the corruption and inefficiency that plagued his first administration. No New Plan for Recovery General Buhari said he intended to put an end to corruption and economic mismanagement but stated that the new military Government had no plan for a speedy financial recovery. He said that when the military gave up control in 1978 to allow a return to democratic rule, it did not realize that civilian politicians would go so far as to ''rig'' the August elections. The elections were widely hailed at the time as a triumph for democracy on a continent dotted with one-party nations. Some Westerners with long experience in Nigeria have expressed surprise at the timing of the coup. Speculation about the possibility of military intervention was rife during the summer's rough-and-tumble election campaign and again when there was a brief outbreak of violence after the announcement of election results accompanied by charges of electoral fraud. When no military intervention took place then, however, many analysts concluded that the military was willing to give Mr. Shagari time to attempt to make good on his campaign promises. The President, in presenting his new austerity budget and acting to reorganize the economy, indicated that, by and large, he would follow the prescriptions of such organizations as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. These included tighter controls on Government spending, encouragement of the agricultural sector and reduced dependence on oil, currently the source of more than 90 percent of Nigeria's income. However, Mr. Shagari resisted calls for a major devaluation of the naira, Nigeria's overvalued currency. Jurists' Group Deplores Coup GENEVA, Jan. 1 (Reuters) - The International Commission of Jurists today deplored the military coup in Nigeria and described Shehu Shagari, the ousted President, as a man universally respected for his integrity. The 30-year-old, Geneva-based body, which works to promote international observance of the rule of law and of human rights, called on the new administration of Maj. Gen. Mohammed Buhari to allow civilians to be tried by civilian courts and to permit freedom of speech, of the press and of trade union activity. ''The International Commission of Jurists deplores the military coup in Nigeria overthrowing a democratically elected Government, re-elected only a few months ago by a large majority and led by President Shagari, universally repected for his integrity,'' a statement issue by the organization said."
