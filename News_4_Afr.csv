The power, tax, investment and transport sectors have been identified as having the highest level of corruption, according to a draft finding by a study under the Federal Ethics & Anti-Corruption Commission (FEACC). Employees of the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo) have been identified by the study as being frontrunners in asking for unofficial payments, with an average of 10 bribe requests for a single respondent in the study. The EEPCo is also the organisation with the highest average number of foreign companies seeking its services. Traffic police, on the other hand, have asked more of the respondents for bribes than any of the entities surveyed, according to the report. The draft report, which included the responses of 350 foreign investors, took two and half months to produce. The final report is expected to be released a month after the World Bank approves its finalisation according to the guidelines. ""Around 16.6pc of the respondents reported a total count of 370 requests with an average of six bribe demands per respondent,"" said the draft study released on Thursday, January 25, 2014, at the Hilton Hotel, under the title ""Perception of the Level of Corruption by Foreign Investors in Ethiopia"". Six percent of the respondents also reported that employees of the Ethiopian Revenues & Customs Authority (ERCA) had asked them for money- a total count of 54 times for customs licenses and 49 times for tax inspection. The findings of the draft study, nevertheless, indicated that grand corruption is not a threat to Ethiopia, as none of the respondents reported confronting it. ""Petty corruptions exist in almost every office,"" said Ameha Diana, director general of Selam Development Consultants Plc, which conducted the survey. ""With only some institutions standing out in level of corruption, Ethiopia is freer than several other countries as far as corruption is concerned."" Judges and court officials, employees of standards and safety offices, those in the water and sewerage agency and the state telecommunications company, ethio telecom, have also been identified as asking for bribes. Employees involved with customs and trade licenses, land acquisition, licensing authorities and tax agencies, as well as government procurement have not been immune to allegations of bribery. The results reveal that employees in these agencies are collecting bribe money ranging from 5,000 to 7,000 Br. ""These employees can get paid a maximum bribe of 20,000 to 50,000 Br,"" the draft study said. ""The Commission's strategic focus areas are taxation and revenue collection, the justice sector, procurement in major infrastructural projects, land administration and financial management,"" Wedo Atto, the deputy Commissioner, said in his opening remark at the launching of the draft study. Back in 2012, the second nationwide corruption survey, which was commissioned by the Commission and conducted by a Tanzanian-based US company, Kilimanjaro International Corporation (KIC), disclosed that a considerable number of the public had to make extra payments in the form of gratification to public institutions.. The judiciary, law enforcement community, municipalities and the ERCA were identified as the places most people perceived as being prone to corruption and inefficient public service delivery, according to that survey. The Commission, nevertheless, wants more than one research to point to similar problems before it takes any measures, says Berhanu Assefa, Director of Ethics Education & Communication Affairs. The World Bank (WB), Department for International Development (DFID), Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) collaborated with the FEACC in conducting the latest survey."520,Addis Fortune,2/23/14,High Profile Corruption Case - Prosecutor's Three-Month Extension Request Reduced to Just One,,ETHIOPIA (93%),Newspaper,Fasika Tadesse,ENGLISH,25-Feb-14,,608 words,CORRUPTION (92%); EXCISE & CUSTOMS (91%); PUBLIC FINANCE (90%); LAWYERS (89%); INSPECTIONS (89%); CRIMINAL DEFENSES (89%); ETHICS (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); TAX FRAUD (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (77%); TAX ENFORCEMENT (77%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (77%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (77%); TAX AUTHORITIES (76%); TAXES & TAXATION (73%); FREIGHT BROKERS & FORWARDERS (50%) Ethiopia; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Corruption,"The case has been ongoing since last May and has seen many high profile names imprisoned throughout Defence lawyers for top federal officials accused of corruption rested their case this week, and the court gave prosecutors one month to rebut the arguments. The Federal High Court's 15th Criminal Bench has adjourned the high-profile corruption charges against Melaku Fenta - former director general of the Ethiopian Revenues & Customs Authority (ERCA), and others, until March 18, 2014. This decision came following the prosecutors' request for more time to review the statement of defence. Senior ERCA officials were accused of relaxing the inspection procedures for undue benefits, by using the mutually beneficial relationships they established with high profile businessmen. The charge specifically mentioned the personal connections of Nega G. Egziabhere of Netsa Trading Plc, and Gebrewahed W. Giorgis, the-then deputy to Melaku in the Law Enforcement Division of the ERCA, as well as Ketema Kebede of K.K Plc, with Melaku. Melaku and Gebrewahed were also charged with violating a law that instituted impromptu inspections at the ERCA's Adama Branch, after a study revealed that the customs clearance system in that branch was looser than Kaliti and thus preferred by alleged tax evaders. The study was conducted to investigate why the Kaliti Customs Office was producing low revenues. This, the charge says, has made corrupt practices prevalent. Other charges were made, predominantly against customs officials from the ERCA's Adama Branch and Modjo Dry Port and Terminal, freight-forwarders and their family members. During the court session held on Monday, February 17, 2014, 12 defendants presented a statement of defence. They included Melaku; Gebrewahed; Belachew Beyene, former Audit Directorate director; Markneh Alemayehu, deputy prosecutor; Eshetu Giref of the Kality Branch of the ERCA;Haimanot Tesfay (Col.), Gebrewahad's wife;Fitsum G. Medihn, a businessman; Amogne Tagele, former director of the ERCA's Adama Branch Office;Tigabu Gidey, who used to work in the Tax Collection Department of the ERCA's Adama Branch; Semere Nigusse, Customs Inspection officer at the Modjo Dry Port; Mareshet Tesfaye, of MD Transit Plc and Woldesellasie W. Michael, a senior national security advisor. The Prosecutors from the Federal Ethics & Anti-Corruption Commission (FEACC), who requested a three month period to respond to bulky written objections filed by these and other defendants - totalling 66 charged under three separate files - drew murmurs of objection from the courtroom. The prosecutors' request was objected to by attorneys of the defendants, who argued that three months was too lengthy and would hamper the interests of their clients who remain in custody. The attorneys argued that the Commission, as an institution, could deploy more staff to review the statement of defence in a shorter period of time. The Court reduced the prosecutors' request to one month. It also allowed the attorneys of Ketema and K.K Plc to make corrections to the statement of defence they submitted during the previous session. Fikru Maru (MD), who runs Addis Cardiac Hospital, was not present in the court due to illness. In May 2013, a joint operation by law enforcement agencies made a round of arrests of senior government officials and prominent businessmen suspected of wrongdoings in relation to tax. During the lengthy investigation period, suspects have remained in custody without bail, except for those the Commission released itself. Most of the detainees have been kept at the Akaki (including Melaku and Gebrewahed) and Kilinto prison facilities."533,Addis Fortune,3/23/14,Federal High Court Presides Over Statements in High Profile Corruption Case,,ETHIOPIA (93%),Newspaper,Fasika Tadesse,ENGLISH,24-Mar-14,,776 words,CORRUPTION (93%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); PUBLIC FINANCE (90%); TAX AUTHORITIES (89%); INSPECTIONS (89%); EXCISE & CUSTOMS (89%); TAX LAW (78%); CRIMINAL DEFENSES (78%); JUDGES (78%); LITIGATION (78%); ETHICS (77%); INVESTIGATIONS (77%); TAX ENFORCEMENT (77%); TAX FRAUD (77%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (77%); LAWYERS (75%); SUITS & CLAIMS (73%); TAXES & TAXATION (70%) Ethiopia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Governance,"The rebuttals to the defence have been submitted in soft copy to reduce the time spent presiding over them The Federal High Court's 15th Criminal Bench has adjourned the high profile corruption case against Melaku Fenta - former director general of the Ethiopian Revenues & Customs Authority - et al to April 24, 2014. This is in order to decide over the statement of defence submitted by defendants and the prosecutors' rebuttal to the statements. On Tuesday, March 18, 2014, prosecutors from the Federal Ethics & Anti-Corruption Commission (FEACC) submitted rebuttals to the statements of defence presented by defence lawyers for top federal officials and high-profile business people accused of corruption on February 17, 2014, and previous court sessions. Tuesday's session came after the Court gave prosecutors one month to rebut the arguments. The Commission's prosecutors came up with the rebuttals in written form. The presiding judge asked the prosecutors to submit the rebuttals in soft copy, citing two reasons. One of these has to do with reviewing the rebuttals in a shorter period of time. The judge also said that submitting the rebuttals in soft copy makes it possible to convert to Braille, because one of the defendants is blind. Prosecutors of the Commission filed the charge to the Court on Melaku Fenta and the other 66 defendants under three separate charge files. Following this, 12 defendants submitted statements of defence in a written document on February 17, 2014, while the remaining defendants had submitted them during previous court sessions. Those who submitted statements of defence on February 17 included Melaku; Gebrewahed W. Giorgis, the-then deputy to Melaku in the Law Enforcement Division of the ERCA; Belachew Beyene, former Audit Directorate director; Markneh Alemayehu, deputy prosecutor; Eshetu Giref of the Kality Branch of the ERCA; Haimanot Tesfay (Col.), Gebrewahed's wife; Fitsum G. Medihn, a businessman; Amogne Tagele, former director of the ERCA's Adama Branch Office; Tigabu Gidey, who used to work in the Tax Collection Department of the ERCA's Adama Branch; Semere Nigusse, Customs Inspection officer at the Modjo Dry Port; Mareshet Tesfaye, of MD Transit Plc and Woldesellasie W. Michael, a senior national security advisor. Melaku and Gebrewahed were charged with transgressing a law that instituted sudden inspections at the ERCA's Adama Branch, the clearance system of which, according to a study conducted to investigate why the Kaliti Customs Office was fetching minimal revenues, was looser than Kaliti and thus preferred by alleged tax evaders. The two tax officials were also charged with loosening the inspection procedures to get excessive benefits, by using the mutually beneficial relationships they established with high profile businessmen. The charge specifically cited personal connections between Gebrewahed and Nega G. Egziabhere of Netsa Trading Plc, as well as Ketema Kebede of K.K Plc with Melaku. Charges were also filed against customs officials from the ERCA's Adama Branch and Modjo Dry Port and Terminal, freight-forwarders and their family members. The attorneys of K.K Plc and Ketema Kebede claimed that news reports about the court sessions by the state-owned Ethiopian Radio & Television Agency (ERTA) were biased and defamed their clients. The presiding judge replied, however, that the Court has already passed a decision on this same claim previously. The judge told the attorneys to go back and refer to the decisions. The attorney of Fitsum Gebremedhin, a merchant who was charged with tax fraud and corruption, asked the Court to release his client on bail. The judge asked him why the request came at this time, saying that the right time to ask for bail right was during previous court sessions. The attorney replied that the request for bail rights came at this time following the amendment made by the prosecutor to the original charges against his client. The attorney argued that his client should be released on bail since the prosecutor cancelled the charge of corruption during the amendment. ""The punishment for the remaining charge against my client may not exceed 10 years,"" he argued. The judge said they will give him a response to his request by the next session, on April 24, 2014. According to the Revised Anti-Corruption Special Procedure & Rules of Evidence Proclamation of 2005, a person arrested for a corruption offence punishable by more than 10 years may not be released on bail. Senior government officials and prominent business people suspected of offences in relation to tax were arrested in May 2013 following a joint operation by law enforcement agencies."546,Addis Fortune,5/4/14,Three Former Senior Land Officials Freed From Corruption Charges,,ETHIOPIA (92%),Newspaper,Fasika Tadesse Fortune Staff Writer,ENGLISH,8-May-14,"ADIS ABEBA, ETHIOPIA (92%)",542 words,CORRUPTION (92%); ETHICS (90%); VERDICTS (89%); NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY (75%); SUITS & CLAIMS (73%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (73%); CONSTRUCTION (73%); LAND LEASES (73%); RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION (73%); BUILDING PERMITS (68%); HOTELS & MOTELS (55%) Ethiopia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"A majority vote by judges on Tuesday April 28, 2014, have found not guilty former Addis Abeba land deputy, Kassim Fite, and two of his subordinates from corruption charges leveled against them by the Federal Ethics & Anti Corruption Commission (FEACC) over a 433 sqm plot of land. A third defendant in the case will still face charges. The Commission sued Kassim, who was deputy head of the Addis Ababa Land Development and Administration office, and three others, claiming that they had misused their power to snatch away the plot from Girma Afewerk (Eng) and give it to Yohannes Derseh, owner of the Alexandria Hotel, for expansion. The charge claims that Kassim, supported by wrong legal advise to the former land management board from the second defendant Tesfaye Zemdekun, who was an expert at Addis Abeba Justice Bureau, gave the land to Yohannes. The third defendant Gebreyesus Kidane, director of Construction Permits during the time, allegedly failed to mention that Girma, after initially losing the land, had asked again to get it back for investment purposes, and the fourth defendant, Bekele Gebre, who was head of the Land Bank & Transfer Office, was also an accomplice in the wrong decision of the board. The dismissed charges also held the defendants responsible for 342,500 Br in damages for construction inputs, which Girma had used on the land, when it was taken from him. Two of the three judges of the Federal High Court's First Criminal Bench, Getachew Yirga, Zewditu Tafesse, and Yosef Kiros, ruled that only Tesfaye had to defend the charges against him, while they voted to let Kassim and the other two walk free, a decision to which Judge GetachewYirga did not agree. ""The charge against Kassim, Gebreyesus and Bekele should not be dropped; they should defend the charges with Tesfaye, because the prosecutor's documents and witnesses implicate them in the crime,"" Getachew wrote in his ruling. Tesfaye, who, by majority vote, will be the sole defendant, will defend the charges against him starting from the next appointment, May 7, 2014. He is eligible a bail of 5,000 Br. The plot in question is in Bole District Woreda 3, Kebelle 19. It used to have three residential houses on a total of 500 sqm plot. When Girma first got the land, he was given a temporary plan in 2010 for 433 sqm, and he had to build houses for the residents there in alternative plots arranged by the city. But later the land management office annulled Girma's plan some time before the board decision to lease the land to Yohannes after he paid 571,000 Br for the 433 sqm plot of land in 2012. The board decided to pass the land to Yohannes, the prosecutor claimed, because Bekele and Gebreyesus had failed to inform the board that Girma had wanted the land for investment. The three judge sruled that the defendants should not be sued as the board's decision to lease the land to Yohannes had come after Girma's plan was annulled, as a result of which his request to invest on the land could not be an essential evidence for the charge. Yohannes Derseh, owner of the Alexandria Hotel, said his application to expand on the plot had been waiting 10 years before he got the permission. Girma would not comment, saying he had no knowledge of the Court's decision."506,Concord Times (Freetown),1/31/14,'Salary Increase Will Curb Police Corruption' - Police Media Boss,,GHANA (79%),Newspaper,Alusine Sesay,ENGLISH,31-Jan-14,,299 words,CORRUPTION (93%); WAGES & SALARIES (90%); POLICE FORCES (90%); POLICE MISCONDUCT (90%); CIVIL SERVICES (78%); BRIBERY (78%); INTERVIEWS (78%); PRESS CONFERENCES (73%) Sierra Leone; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Head of Police Media and spokesman has told Concord Times in an exclusive interview that the new salary increase by the government ""will go a long way in curbing corruption within the police"", but urged the government to do more by ensuring their salary is competitive with other police forces in the sub-region. Comparatively, according to Assistant Superintendent Ibrahim Samura, the Sierra Leone Police are still not better paid, considering what their counterparts in the sub-region are receiving as take-home-pay. ""Police officers in Ghana are paid about US$800 [a month], while the Sierra Leone Police personnel are receiving far less than that,"" he said. The Sierra Leone Police force has, in various reports, been classed as the most corruption institution in the country. A 2008 Public Perception Survey report published by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) rated the police as 85 percent corrupt. The report was, however, vehemently challenged by the Inspector General of Police, Francis Munu, at a press conference just days after the ranking was released by the country's anti-graft commission. Also, some rank and file members within the police argued that they are poorly paid and that most of them are tempted to receive bribes so as to meet their family needs. Previously, most police constables were receiving below US$100 as monthly salary. Prior to the 2012 elections, the situation became much better as each police officer started receiving a bag of rice in addition to their monthly salaries. As at present, the least police officer is receiving above US$100, reflecting the new salary increase by the government for all public workers. ""We heartily appreciate the new increase and we believe such would go a long way in curbing corruption within the police,"" said ASP Samura."600,Concord Times (Freetown),12/19/14,"Mayor, MPs Corruption Dramaacc Urged to Investigate",,SIERRA LEONE (93%),Newspaper,"Mohamed Massaquoi, Jariatu Bangura and Samuel J.

It could be recalled that Mayor Keifala on Tuesday 16 December, during the popular 'Good Morning Salone' radio programme aired on FM 98.1, claimed that he had been reliably informed by the Deputy Chief Administrator that the council's annual budget for 2015 would not be approved by the committee on the ground that they had failed to give a bribe to members of the committee. This warranted the invitation of the Mayor and team to prove their allegations. The committee room was full to capacity with parliamentarians, journalists, heads of institutions, civil society representatives and members of the public all attending the hearing on a matter that has generated so much public interest since the claim by the Mayor that some MPs had requested for Le20 million before his council's budget will be approved. Deputy Chief Administrator Fofanah informed the panel of MPs that indeed some members of the Sub-Appropriation Committee did request from them a bribe, for which he later called the Chief Administrator and the Mayor and informed them about the development. Fofanah said he categorically told the MPs that they had no money to give out; a development he said led to the council's annual budget to be overlooked and not debated upon by the committee. ""I consider this to be an unfortunate development, and I had to communicate back immediately as I was representing my Chief Administrator,"" Fofanah told the panel. ""We were in parliament on the 26th November 2014 alongside three other senior officials, including the Finance Officer. We were taken to an office where we met Hon. Abubakarr S.A.T. Koroma, Hon. Hassan Sheriff among other MPs. We were told that one Chairman Fofanah has negotiated on behalf of the councils, but I said to them we were not prepared for that. Because of this, we were directed to one Mr. Sannoh, the committee's clerk, to hand over our documents. I later returned to Kenema and informed the Mayor about what had transpired. The Mayor then told me there was no money to give to the committee."" Fofanah said despite pleading for an adjournment, the committee refused to grant them their wish. ""Usually, we do some gestures when we come to parliament,"" he revealed. In his statement, the Majority Leader of Parliament, Hon. Ibrahim Bundu, who chaired the panel, said over 128 ministries, departments and agencies have already presented their budgets without any hindrance, noting that they have the power to withhold budgets if there was no proper accountability. ""The media should serve as a responsible gatekeeper but the manner in which the station [98.1 FM] handled the program was unprofessional,"" blasted Hon. Bundu. ""Article 9 of the IMC Act stipulates that live phone-in programs must be managed in such a way that they are not used to incite violence and public disorder. This matter will be handed over to the Anti-Corruption Commission for further investigation,"" he concluded."613,Concord Times (Freetown),2/13/15,'Corruption' Slowed Ebola Response,,SIERRA LEONE (94%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,13-Feb-15,,601 words,EBOLA VIRUS DISEASE (95%); TROPICAL DISEASES (91%); EMERGENCY VEHICLES (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (89%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (89%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (89%); AUDITS (89%); VIRUSES (78%); AGREEMENTS (78%); ACCOUNTING (77%); EXECUTIVES (72%); INDICTMENTS (69%); MARINE & WATERWAY CONSTRUCTION (69%); PUBLIC CONTRACTS LAW (67%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (65%); AIR FARES (63%) Sierra Leone; Ebola; Corruption,"Monies set aside for the purpose of combating the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone may have been used for unintended purposes, thereby slowing the government's response to eradicate the virus, notes a report on the audit of the management of the Ebola funds laid on the table of Parliament yesterday by the deputy Speaker of the House, Hon. Chernor Maju Bah. The report, titled ""Audit of the Management of the Ebola Funds"", covers the period between May and October 2014. Among the plethora of revelations made by Audit Service Sierra Leone (ASSL) is the Ministry of Health and Sanitation's alleged failure to produce any documentation for contract agreements that amounted to Le17 billion (including Le12.7 billion for the purchase of 50 vehicles and ambulances, and Le2.7 billion for the construction of the Port Loko Treatment Centre) - all to aid the fight against the dreaded Ebola virus. ""There was a complete disregard for the law on public procurement in an emergency situation. For instance, contracts were entered into without any clear guidelines on the specification of items required,"" the report discloses. ""Furthermore, contracts were badly drawn up as if to allow for additional costs to be incurred thereby preventing a transparent, competitive and cost effective procurement."" The ASSL report further highlights that the contract in respect of the purchase of 20 ambulances for a contract sum of US$1,050,000 was inappropriately entered into ""as specific areas relating to the inspection, transportation and delivery of the ambulances were excluded in the Special Conditions of the contract"". Consequently, the report notes, additional costs of $60,590 and Le39,330,000 were incurred in respect of air freight, daily subsistence allowance and airfare for the ambulances bought by the Ministry of Health and Sanitation. In addition, contracts worth over Le1 billion in respect of food for quarantined homes were awarded to various suppliers without regard to the provisions of the procurement regulation in relation to procurement in an emergency, it adds. The ASSL audit team further found that payments were made to the Member of Parliament for Constituency 93 in Goderich to carry out sensitisation activities even though an amount had earlier been paid to all seating members of parliament for similar activities. Also, the report indicts civil society activist and Executive Director of Health For All Coalition (HFAC), Charles Mambu, whose organisation was said to have been loaned the sum of Le421,800,000 for scaling up of the response to the Ebola fight. The auditors were however concerned that the said loaned amount was made in the name of Charles Mambu instead of HFAC, the organisation which he represents. ""In addition, the loan was not documented and the repayment terms were not agreed between the ministry and HFAC,"" the report indicates. To this, the report recommends that the Permanent Secretary and the Director of Financial Resources in the Ministry of Health provide adequate explanation for this discrepancy within seven days of the receipt of the report. The ministry, it admonishes, should also ensure that it desists from such practices and that all further payments be addressed in the name of the beneficiary organisations and not individuals. ""The Permanent Secretary should also submit to the Audit Service within seven (7) days an approved repayment terms and conditions for the recovery of the loan given to the Health for All Coalition for audit inspection; and also implement the necessary measures to recover the funds within the shortest possible time,"" ASSL demands."637,Concord Times (Freetown),4/15/15,"ACC, NMO Campaign Against Ebola and Corruption",,SIERRA LEONE (90%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,15-Apr-15,,305 words,CORRUPTION (94%); TROPICAL DISEASES (90%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (90%); EBOLA VIRUS DISEASE (90%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (78%); VIRUSES (71%); RURAL COMMUNITIES (68%); SECONDARY SCHOOLS (56%) Sierra Leone; Ebola; Corruption,"Some two hundred men and women of the National Marketing Organization (NMO) on Saturday 11th April joined the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) in an end Ebola and anti- corruption campaign across major markets in Freetown. The ""End Ebola and Corruption Campaign"" was a sensitization exercise to educate the public, especially marketers, on the dangers of Ebola and corruption and the benefits of eradicating both diseases. Addressing the campaigners at the entrance of the Vine Memorial Secondary School, Congo Cross, the ACC Deputy Commissioner, Shollay Davies, commended NMO for partnering with the commission and stressed the significance of the campaign as Sierra Leone grapples with the countdown to ending the Ebola virus disease. Mr. Davies entreated the marketers to disseminate anti-Ebola and anti-corruption messages as buyers and sellers would better understand information from them. He highlighted key messages that would constitute the campaign notably: the community has power to stop Ebola; safe and dignified burial; only you and I can say no to Ebola; and celebrate survivors. He assured the marketers and the general public of the commission's ""undiluted support"" to crack down on corruption in the fight against Ebola in the country. Earlier, the Director of Public Education and Outreach Department, Koloneh Sankoh, admonished the marketers to observe the preventive measures of hand washing and 'no body contact' as they raise awareness on Ebola. She underscored the commission's resolve to working with civil society groups to eradicate corruption in all its forms.

Beker assumed the position after the ex-director general, Melaku Fenta, and his deputy, Gebrewahid Woldegiorgis, were indicted with corruption charges for which they are standing trial currently. Since then, Beker has been focused on house-clearing activities and serious evaluation processes. In the nine month the authority identified that corruption has been its primary concern and in the process some 122 employees were given their marching orders while many others were given stern warnings and/or reassignments. Recently, the authority held its third countrywide tax conference where it met taxpayers mainly from the business community. At the conference the authority announced that it is in the process of transformation. Birhanu Fekade of The Reporter sat down with the director to expound on this new change and transformation. Excerpts: The Reporter: Recently you held the third countrywide tax conference. A conference aimed at raising stakeholders' awareness about the tax reform you are undertaking and some of the challenges the tax system is facing. But you have been doing the some for years now, what is so different this time? Beker Shale: To evaluate the changes in this sector, I prefer to look at it from two different perspectives. Most of the time, challenges are springboards to finding solutions. So the first step is to identify the strong and weak sides of the main executing body, the Revenues and Customs Authority. Hence, the past nine months were mainly dedicated to trainings and changing the mindsets. In that, we have to reach an understanding as to what extent the complaint of the taxpayer is true and how we can fix them. We tried to form consensus on the matter with personnel at all levels. I do not know how one would perceive change and judge if change has come to the tax system for instance. But this much I know, now authority's personnel at all levels are ready to solve these problems. The other side of the story is our engagement with the taxpayer. We tried to access taxpayers through our regional, Addis Ababa and federal levels. This time, we tried to make the communication between the taxpayer and the tax collector that of a relationship of equals so that there is transparency in our communication. Apart from that, we have a regular schedule to meet with the taxpayer and learn about their problems. As a direct outcome to this, we have also taken steps to reform some parts of our system that have proven to be a problem for the taxpayers. Especially, issues in relation to tax grievances and the work of the technical committee, which remained a long and protracted process until recently, is set to be handled by the law and the law only. On the other hand, we also have launched customs evaluation software. This new software is expected to solve some of the problems in relation to customs evaluation. We are also speeding up our one-stop-shop project. Besides, we have taken some steps to give solution to some of the problems that have been rolling for sometime, issues including the dividend tax directive and those with tour and travel companies. So, I think, if these efforts are strengthened, we would see real changes soon. Recently, investigation by the auditor general found out that out of the 79 thousand cash register machines in the tax system, only 12 thousand send their reports regularly, while some 15 thousand of these machines have no link to the tax system whatsoever. What was that all about? I do not have the details of the auditors general report. But, as far as the cash register machines are concerned, the reach seems to be expanding by day. Previously, taxpayers had doubts about the machine. This was because of the speculation that the machines are introduced to monitor each and every financial activity of businesses. So, this had bad bearings on the speed with which the machines were introduced into the tax system. Later on, the members of the business community started to realize that using the machines would actually save them from embezzlement and can help develop trust in the tax system. However, we also understand that not all machines are working properly. This is mainly due to two reasons. One is the network problem; some of the machines are not sending proper reports because of our own network problem. Now, we are following up on such issues and are trying to give quick fixes whenever possible. There are also some who have the intention of hiding their tax returns. Some of them also argue that they have lost the machines; the problems are diverse. Hence, one can see that many machines are not sending proper reports to the central database. I hope we will have the auditor general's report very soon. And then we can take corrective measures to improve on identified issues. At the moment, the tax authority is one of the most feared institutions in the country. You have resources at your disposal including your own intelligence, monitoring and follow teams and like to enforce tax law. However, you still could not stop those who are printing and using illegal VAT receipts right in the middle of the capital city. What does that say about you? By the way, fear of law enforcement by itself cannot ensure compliance. There is a big difference between fearing the law and respecting the law. All over the world, criminals do what they do knowing what the legal consequence is going to be. By the same token, tax fraud is also not about fearing the law enforcement. It is a crime. It is committed in defiance of law and its percussions. This tells you that enforcement can never guarantee compliance of tax obligations. Rather what works is awareness and consensus building around tax; and why citizens pay taxes. Everyone loves their country, so taxpayers should be aware that tax evasion is crime against one's own people and its growth and progress. By taking measures, one cannot teach society to execute its tax obligations. Nevertheless, those who are found in clear violation of laws should be punished according to the law. As tax is something that society in general stands to benefit from, I think, the people should stand side-by-side with the tax authority to fight this crime. Talking about tax compliance, Mercato has been one problem area that the tax authority identified. And you have been focused on Mercato for quite some time now. Nevertheless, it still is the most problematic area of all, why is that? Mercato is the biggest open market in Ethiopia where some of the prominent wholesalers and distributers are located. Historically, it was a very concentrated market. This concentration is declining to some extent now. For ages Mercato handled large volumes of trade, which has more of a shadow market nature. Although not all, there are some whose main line of business is distributing contraband items in the market. In doing so, they are distorting the market. Their impact extends to the regional markets; of course they have partners in regionals who will assist them in distorting the market. After we kick started the Mercato project, a number of businesses joined the taxation system; a number of them registered for VAT, Turnover taxes since then. However, we cannot say this is a structural change since the problem still exists. For instance, those under the formal tax system suffer as they engage in transaction with those outside of the tax system. This is exhibited specially in the regional markets. The businessmen in regional market are ready to expose them. At any rate, we should put an end to the deep-rooted problems of Mercato. Another issue is with the discipline of your employees. Previously, the authority itself admitted that it has been challenged with corruption and fraud. Employing different forgery tactics, the employees have embezzled a lot of money in the past, and now the new college graduates you are recruiting are rumored to have raised the bribe money. So, where is the change that you speak of? Although I cannot argue that such problems do not exist. I have to admit that I do not have the information about what you are talking about. Yes, we have a discipline problem that we to have deal with. And, if there are individuals who are engaged in such activities like forging documents, the society should come forward and expose them. What we can do is that when the taxpayer faces such problems they can approach the tax authority and ask for documentations to be verified. I think corrupt employees of the tax authority can only intimidate those taxpayers who are not legal themselves. The taxpayer should not be intimidated that easily since there are ways to get second opinions about the matter at hand. But, I cannot accept your assertion that new university graduates hired by the authority are generally corrupt. There are a lot of fresh graduate recruits who are well-behaved and work diligently for their country. At the same time, there are also some who come with a rent-seeking attitude; or get infected with one after joining. But, I cannot think it is that big of a deal since as long as the awareness is there both the taxpayer and the other workers would expose them. Still talking about discipline, we also heard that around Mercato, some of your monitoring and follow up personnel even have informal salary offers and some of them also serve as critical informants to those who pay them a surprise tax audit. And/or surprise visit of tax authority personnel. How do you see this? Yes, we have also received such information repeatedly. We have also heard that there are brokers who would create the link between the tax personnel and the taxpayer. Here what has to be understood is that it is the rent-seeking nature in the business community that will give our personnel the chance to prosper from such activities. You see, it is partly due to problems among the business community that helps. These businesses might have some illegal activities that they do not want people to discover. The business community has to take them down off his/her shoulder by exposing them to the authority. But, it is also important to understand that there are tax personnel who do their job diligently. I am in no way trying to intimidate those personnel that go out to do their monitoring job. Nevertheless, there are some we are following either in secrecy or openly. These days the capital flight is becoming a problem for most African countries. Experts accuse big multinational companies of exaggerating prices and flying with billions of dollars; Ethiopia is among them. What are you doing to withstand this pressure? I have a hard time buying that Ethiopia is loosing billions of dollars to capital flight and illicit financial transaction. Maybe it could be a report that is outdated. It is very difficult to verify such reports. However, we do have controlling mechanisms to monitor financial activities, financial resources either going out or coming into the country. We try to monitor the activities at our various checkpoints. Thus far, we have not come across such data. For instance, over invoicing is one mechanism by which capital can be... Well, you can address this question to the responsible authorities like the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED) or the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE); we do not have such information or data. Last budget year, you succeeded in collecting some 107 billion birr, how is your performance going for the current budget year? As per our nine-month performance, especially in terms of what has to be transferred to MoFED, we have met 97 percent of our target. For Addis Ababa as well, it is somewhere around 89 percent. But, this is only what the Addis Ababa branch has collected, when we add what the federal collects and channels to the city, the target is already met. Hence, I can say that our nine-month performance was encouraging; it will not be too hard to meet 100 percent of our target in the remaining time."564,Mmegi/The Reporter (Gaborone),7/12/14,Rooting Out Corruption,,ETHIOPIA (93%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,14-Jul-14,,782 words,BUDGETS (90%); CORRUPTION (89%); ANNUAL REPORTS (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); APPROVALS (78%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (78%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (77%); EMBEZZLEMENT (74%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (74%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (72%); EXCISE & CUSTOMS (69%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS (65%); URBAN TRANSIT SYSTEMS (64%); TARIFFS & DUTIES (50%) Ethiopia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Some 178.5 birr (close to USD 9 billion) was approved by the House of Peoples' Representatives as federal government expenditure for the budget year. As the closing year of the Government of Ethiopia's 5-year Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) during which the economic growth recorded over the past decade is expected to be consolidated, much needs to be done in order to tackle the problems that have rolled over the years and stand in the way of the achievement of the GTP. The new fiscal year must see an all-out effort by the government to eradicate bad governance and corruption, scourges which are a source of widespread public discontent. Unless government structures at all levels rid themselves of bad governance, corruption and mismanagement, it would be impossible to utilize properly the huge budget allocated for the federal government. Though the government has vowed repeatedly to deal with the causes to which the grievances widely expressed by the public are attributed, the problems are still pervasive. Hence, any and all practices of public officials and servants which advance their selfish interest at the expense of the public require prompt response by all concerned. The egregious acts committed by organized elements both within the government and outside are preventing the delivery of services efficiently and in compliance with quality standards. There exist patently grave problems in the areas of the issuance and renewal of trade license and certificate of competence; the assessment and payment of tax and customs duty; the provisioning of land and other municipal services; the availability and quality of telecom, power, water and mass transit services; the miscarriage of justice at the hands of the lowest administrative units to the highest organs of the judiciary, etc. These manifestations of bad governance not only actively harm the national and public interest but also lead to disenfranchisement and thereby the erosion of political capital. As such they require urgent action on the part of all stakeholders. The rampant corruption besetting the country is another serious challenge. Without prejudice to the arrest and prosecution in 2013 of senior government officials on charges of grand corruption, the problem continues to spread like wildfire. Creating a society which abhors corruption, important as it is, is not enough to combat corruption. The anti-corruption drive under way should be ramped up so that anyone caught up in it must be brought to justice and punished to the full extent of the law. The Federal Auditor General has repeatedly stated in its annual report to Parliament that several government institutions are guilty of failing to reconcile substantial sums of money. Although it would be rash to conclude that the unreconciled money was all embezzled, the government is obliged to take firm action in the backdrop of the gaps observed in the financial management of the agencies it runs. The shoddy practices characterizing the procurement and property administration of government offices also opens the door for corruption. In fact such practices have allowed several millionaires to spring up overnight. Ethiopia badly needs a no-nonsense leadership which enforces strict oversight. After all, a bureaucracy that is mired in bad governance and corruption is incapable of administering properly the huge budget approved by lawmakers as well as implement faithfully the next phase of the GTP due to commence a year from now. Therefore, as bad governance and corruption cannot be tolerated by any country let alone a poor nation as ours, those messing up with the country and the public must be stopped by all legal means. The 2014/2015 fiscal year is a time Ethiopia will hold the fifth national elections. Given that an electorate fed up with the lack of good governance and the prevalence may very well punish the politicians running for office through its vote, the contenders have no choice but to get their acts together. As we have said time and again in Ethiopia the value given to good governance does not go beyond paying lip service to its importance. And the fight against corruption is being conducted sporadically instead of a coordinated and unbiased manner. The impact this will have on the outcome of the elections should keep awake all who take part in them. Actions which are not anchored in the interest of the public are bound to be counterproductive and come back to haunt their perpetrators. This makes it imperative for the government to put, at the start of the new fiscal year, the eradication of bad governance and corruption squarely at the forefront of the critical agendas it pursues for the year."570,Mmegi/The Reporter (Gaborone),8/16/14,Acquitted Corruption Suspect Secures Key Position in City Administration,,ETHIOPIA (94%),Newspaper,Wudineh Zenebe,ENGLISH,16-Aug-14,"ADIS ABEBA, ETHIOPIA (94%)",349 words,CITY GOVERNMENT (95%); CITIES (92%); CORRUPTION (92%); ACQUITTAL (90%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); ETHICS (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT (78%); LAND USE PLANNING (78%); LAND GRANTS (78%); VERDICTS (78%); APPOINTMENTS (72%) Ethiopia; Corruption; Governance,"The former head of land administration of the Addis Ababa City Administration, Kassim Fitte, who was accused of corruption and abuse of power but was later acquitted of all charges by the Federal High Court has been given a new senior position on Mayor Diriba Kuma's team, The Reporter learnt. Along with Kassim, who is now appointed to the post of senior advisor to the mayor in infrastructure affairs, other former officials and also suspects in the same charges: Bekele Gebre and Gebreyesus Kidane were also granted a post in the city administration in tune of head of Urban Land Development and Management Office and Land Granting Process Officer. Three of the former officials were charged by the Federal Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission in connection with 500 square meters of land in Woreda 17 and 19, the charges investigators had instituted explained. The court heard, before reaching the verdict, that the suspects were accused of granting a title deed to the plot of land in question, which was in fact registered under the ownership of Girma Afework (Eng.), to a third party: Yohannes Derseh. The former head of Land Administration and Development Office of the Addis Ababa City Administration, Kassim, has been on trial for a year until the Federal High Court, Second Criminal Bench released him scot-free a few months ago. Kassim was under custody after his immunity was revoked last year by the House of Peoples' Representatives, after being accused of involvement in corruption activities. Kassim was reportedly said to have fled abroad two days after his immunity was revoked. However, police detained him immediately after he came back to Addis Ababa. Later, the Federal Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission's investigators brought him before the Federal High Court. It is also to be recalled that the investigators had claimed that the suspects had allegedly granted the land without a legal basis while he knew that the owner of the land had all the legal documents and the title deed, recognized by the Addis Ababa City Administration and by the city's First Instance Court."590,Mmegi/The Reporter (Gaborone),11/22/14,Fighting Corruption - a Quest for Justice,,ETHIOPIA (92%); HONG KONG (79%),Newspaper,Yonas Abiye,ENGLISH,24-Nov-14,"ADIS ABEBA, ETHIOPIA (92%)",1377 words,CORRUPTION (97%); ETHICS (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); INDICTMENTS (89%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); CIVIL SERVICES (78%); PUBLIC FINANCE (78%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (75%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (75%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (73%); EXCISE & CUSTOMS (67%) Ethiopia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"As part of a series of wide civil service reforms, the Federal Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (FEACC) was established in 2001 whose powers are defined in the revised Proclamation 433 of 2005. The commission's mandate is only at the federal level, which includes the federal cities of Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa. Since 2007, seven of the nine regional states have established their own anti-corruption commissions to fight and prevent corruption in their respective regions. The commission has adapted Hong Kong's three-pronged approach to fighting corruption, which incorporates investigation, prosecution and prevention/ethics education. The corruption law issued a decade ago did not allow FEACC to handle private sector's corruption crimes. It was primarily limited to corruption occurring in government organizations, and was concerned with the private sector only when there is involvement on state level corruption cases. But following the 2012 crackdown on corruption of officials including the then director general of the Ethiopian Revenues and Customs Authority (ERCA), Melaku Fenta, and his erstwhile deputy, Gebrewahid Woldegiorgis, the FEACC had announced that it was drafting a new regulation that will also enable it to investigate and indict the private sector on corruption claims. Now, two years later, the draft law has been tabled before the House of Peoples' Representatives (HPR) on November 13. The draft law immediately attracted the attention of legal experts and the private sector. It also stirred some debates particularly on the new inclusion of provision which gives the commission even mightier power with regard to corruption offenses particularly at the federal level. The new proclamation that shall mainly focus on organizations that manage public finances, such as share companies, proposes that the commission gets full access to investigate and charge private businesses that are suspected of fraudulent activities. According to the draft proclamation, in private businesses someone who uses or administers his/her own resources can use it for their own benefit or the benefit of others since that is their own right and there is no any circumstance to hold them accountable. Therefore, there is no ground to take to indict them based on the definition of corruption but they will only accountable if they are found or suspected of using the fund which is collected from the public or the resources intended for public use, violating their responsibility of administering it only, the draft reads. However, some legal experts have criticized the new provisions that are proposed for amendments. Particularly, the proposed provision that enables the commission ""to withdraw, in accordance with law, investigation and charges as well as corruption cases pending in the court of law"". According to experts, this makes the country's legal system questionable. The draft law, in additions to what is stipulated in the same provision, states that it has the mandate ""to terminate corruption investigation or corruption charges by insuring the forfeiture of the advantage obtained from the crime"". But experts did not see this sub-article in a positive way rather they describe it as something ""that affects the criminal justice system"". A senior official at FEAC told The Reporter than the decision to enable the commission withdrawing the investigation and charges has come after intensive discussions that help resolving corruption issues with a consensus by which the suspect to return any resources that he is believed to have taken. ""This system is very important in resolving the cases by saving the cost of investigation, time and labor"", he said. This is also explained in the draft bill. ""Inclusion of such kinds of provisions for any organization is contradictory with the justice system as it should have been treated with the amendment of the criminal justice system,"" a legal expert, who requested anonymity, told The Reporter. He further suggested that the legislative body should enact a substantive law based on the country's existing legal framework. On Thursday, The Reporter's attempt to obtain comments from Ali Suleiman, commissioner of the FEACC, on the amendment was not successful. He reasoned out by saying that he has a busy schedule and is not willing to comment on the issue until he calls press conference. Still the issue is being dealt with in the parliament including the scheduled public hearing session that the House's Legal and Administration Standing committee will call as of next week. According to the draft proposal, any private company or organization who collects resources, money or property or any organization who is responsible to administer this resources collected for the benefit of the public is to be held accountable for corruption. These include like private sectors engaged in health and education sectors or those who engage in any, activities with provides service related to issuance of licenses, certification or anything related to that. ""These responsibilities that are given to the private sector which would be authorized by the government might be misused for another under advantage and such kinds of acts result in causing damage on the state or public property,"" the document explains. Public organizations include religions organizations, politics parties, international organizations, Edir (a traditional community organization whose members assist each other during the mourning process) or other similar traditional or religious associations. Similarly, companies in the finance sector such as share companies, banks, insurance companies, money transfer agents, are also considered by the document as public organizations definition as they collected money or resources from the public. However, religious organizations, political parties, international organizations as well as micro and small enterprises, Edir and similar traditional associations are exempted from the definition to by regulated by anti-corruption in Ethiopia. While the bill propose several amendments by introducing new provisions; it also equally widens the role, responsibility and power of the commission which is responsible in implementing or enforcing the law. However, there are sorts of issues which are stated in the proposed provisions which look quite contentious and debatable. In fact, still the bill is not endorsed yet. But it is believed to be the main focuses for the Legal and Administration Standing Committee to whom the house referred the bill to. Among the contentious issues for some legal experts is the reason behind the omission of religious organizations, political parties and some enterprises like small one micro enterprise from regulation. ""For micro and small enterprises like Edir, Equb and similar traditional associations, the amount of finance they mobilize and the small number of members the have does not make them a likely target for investigations. In addition, the labor, time and finance that would be spent to investigate and bring them before justice would likely be greater than the amount of money and resource that would be embezzled,"" according to the document. Moreover, the new bill has proposed to strengthen the commission's power over any other federal entities that have the legitimate power to investigate and institute charges regarding any corruption offense related to their respective sectors. ""... no institution having prosecutorial power shall have the power to prosecute corruption offenses falling under the federal jurisdiction unless it is delegated to do so by the commission"". The document explains that since there was no implementation system in the country's legislation, which can help resolves offense cases other than charging in court, it was not able to save financial, time and labor costs that is spent during investigation, trial and debating; and it has not been able to save resources that was embezzled by corruption. The Reporter has learnt that they drove this provision from the British experience. Amid the debates on the provisions, the standing committee scheduled a public hearing session to hear and collect suggestions and recommendation from the public before the draft is sent back to lawmakers for final endorsement."646,Mmegi/The Reporter (Gaborone),5/2/15,House Approves the Removal of Two Judges for Corruption Charges,,ETHIOPIA (79%),Newspaper,Yonas Abiye,ENGLISH,4-May-15,,390 words,CORRUPTION (92%); JUDGES (92%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (91%); APPROVALS (90%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (89%); BRIBERY (89%); ETHICS (78%); JAIL SENTENCING (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); SENTENCING (78%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (78%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (78%); SUPREME COURTS (78%); LITIGATION (78%); VERDICTS (78%); CORRECTIONS (77%) Ethiopia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"The House of Peoples' Representatives (HPR) on Tuesday has unanimously approved the removal of two federal judges for breach of disciplinary rules which resulted in conviction on corruption charges. The House has been reviewing the removal of one Federal High Court and another Federal First Instance Court judges after their case was referred to it by the Federal Judicial Administration Council. Berhanu Meshesha and Zerihun Assefa, former judges in the Federal High and Federal First Instance courts respectively, were named in the judicial administration's report presented to the HPR. The case of the two judges was being reviewed by the House's Legal, Justice and Administration Standing Committee over the last four and half months. The committee told the house that it has found the administration's request relevant to bar the former judges from their position as federal judges. The committee further said in its report that it has proved that the two judges have violated the disciplinary rule as indicated in the report submitted by the judiciary administration. The administration made a decision to revoke the two judges' appointment following their conviction on corruption charges. According to the report presented before the MPs, Berhanu had been a judge for Federal High Court since 2008 while Zerihun had been working for the Federal First Instance Court since February 1998. Berhanu is convicted of abusing his position to acquit an unnamed defendant in a criminal case he presided over after accepting a bribe, according to the administration's report. That prompted the Federal Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to file charges against Berhanu at the Federal High Court. The Federal Supreme Court found Berhanu guilty in absentia and sentenced him to eight years in prison and a 5,000 birr fine on October 12, 2013. Berhanu fled the country before he was convicted. Meanwhile, the Commission accused the second judge, Zerihun, of receiving bribes and, later, the High Court gave him a 4-year prison term along with a 7,000 birr fine. According to the FDRE Constitution, appointment and dismissal of judges can only be effected after an approval by the country's legislative body. The judicial administration requested that the Houses of Peoples' Representatives dismiss the two judges in a letter submitted on April 14, 2014."503,The Daily Monitor,1/26/14,Pass law to recover corruption proceeds,,UGANDA (93%); AFRICA (79%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%),Newspaper,Editorial -1,ENGLISH,26-Jun-14,,386  words,CORRUPTION (94%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); LEGISLATION (77%); LARCENY & THEFT (77%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (76%); POLITICS (76%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (74%),"We must, however, not tire to tighten the noose legally against the corrupt even when they seemingly still manage to get away with it. The proposed Assets Recovery Bill might, therefore, not be the magic wand that will deal the practice a fatal blow but it will go a long way in reducing the maneuverable space for those who engage in corruption. Deputy Inspector General of Government (IGG) Mariam Wangadya has called on Parliament to expedite the passing of the Proceeds of Assets Recovery Bill, 2013 in order to enable the inspectorate seize properties of those convicted of corruption and theft of public property. With most Ugandans clearly disgusted at the level of corruption and many politicians making the fight against corruption as their campaign mantra during every election, one would imagine no urging is required to pass a law such as this which would try to make corruption less beneficial. However, it seems our political leaders are more comfortable talking about fighting corruption than actually fighting the vice. The result is that the vice has continued to grow and has now eaten up every edifice of public life. Uganda has the dubious distinction of being the most corrupt country in East Africa and holds its place among the most corrupt countries in the world. Many laws to fight corruption have been put in place over the years with minimal success. We must, however, not tire to tighten the noose legally against the corrupt even when they seemingly still manage to get away with it. The proposed Assets Recovery Bill might, therefore, not be the magic wand that will deal the practice a fatal blow but it will go a long way in reducing the maneuverable space for those who engage in corruption. But ultimately, the country will have to examine its moral outlook and weigh its ambivalence on vices such as corruption vis-viz the cost to development, human life and the future generation. And this is not just about the leaders who preside over the corruption but the ordinary Ugandans who applaud or look on simply because one of their own has also had an opportunity to steal. Hopefully, when we are sufficiently awakened morally and as the cost of corruption weighs on us individually and collectively, we will take a stand and say enough. Meantime, any law that nibbles at the vice is welcome."504,The Daily Monitor,1/26/14,"NRM regime: 28 years of primitive feudal rule, institutionalised corruption",,UGANDA (94%); AFRICA (79%),Newspaper,Timothy Kalyegira -1,ENGLISH,26-Jun-14,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (92%)",1084  words,ELECTIONS (90%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (90%); POLITICS (90%); TAX FRAUD (89%); CORRUPTION (85%); PIPELINE TRANSPORTATION (78%); TAXES & TAXATION (76%); BRIBERY (76%); OFFICE PROPERTY (74%); SCHOLARSHIPS & GRANTS (74%); POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS (71%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (71%); RENTAL PROPERTY (70%); RADIO BROADCAST INDUSTRY (70%); SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (69%); COMMERCIAL RENTAL PROPERTY (69%); CONTRACT AWARDS (69%); TOURNAMENTS (69%); SPORTS AWARDS (69%); POLITICAL PARTIES (67%); EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (64%); RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY (64%); OLYMPICS (64%),"There is not a single square kilometre in Kampala where everything works fully --- street lights, drainage, piped water, roads and garbage management. At least one or more of these has a problem. In the strict sense of the word, there is no longer such a thing as the NRM. What we see passing off as the NRM is a collection of politicians, businessmen, army, intelligence and police officers, relatives and hustlers all using the name NRM to work to personal advantage. Many ""NRM"" MPs and Cabinet ministers have used that name as a cover to secure licences to operate private radio stations, evade taxes, run for office, and secure jobs and scholarships for their children and other relatives. President Museveni himself does not believe in the NRM but like his ministers and other officials around him must have official cover to go about his private business. Most of the president's relatives get involved in the general election campaigns and work for the re-election task forces on behalf of Museveni as their relative and benefactor, not the NRM as a national political organisation in which they see themselves as a of part. From time to time, this lack of personal conviction about what the NRM is can be seen when newspapers report that various NRM offices in Kampala and in the smaller towns have been closed because they failed to pay rent. This is the way Uganda is being run. Occasionally, such as when the Uganda Cranes is playing a crucial Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match or the athlete Stephen Kiprotich wins Olympic and World championship marathon gold medals, the appearance of patriotism and nationalist fervour is seen. However, on a day-to-day basis, Uganda as a concept does not figure much in most people's minds. They are busy attending to the practical business of trying to get by. Getting by in Uganda today largely means trying to figure out how to defraud the government, inflate tenders and contracts, get kickbacks from awarding tenders, granting media companies advertisements, dodge taxes, lie to their landlords and creditors and in total live out the Ugandan way of corruption, defaulting on everything. The economy upcountry has been eroded, leaving Kampala as the only centre of any meaningful commercial activity. And in Kampala, the construction and growth of the last 28 years has been what the Bible terms pouring new wine into old wineskins. Rather than expand or re-design the city, every 100 square metres of land in Kampala is now being built upon, encroached on, luxury hotels, office buildings and private homes forced onto the old infrastructure and neighbourhoods.Kololo is now more commercial district than residential area, as is Nakasero and Bugolobi. A former residential house becomes a bar or computer training firm, and so cars park along the roadside, blocking public traffic. Kampala has turned into a city without any plan and even important embassies like the American, Swiss and others essentially are located in slum areas. There is not a single square kilometre in Kampala where everything works fully --- street lights, drainage, piped water, roads and garbage management. At least one or more of these has a problem. Many people who live in parts of Jinja, Mbarara, Fort Portal, Entebbe and Masaka towns, if they have corporate jobs or stable businesses actually live a much better quality of life than the vast majority of Kampala's residents. Politically, the last 28 years have seen Uganda regress to the old feudal ways of the pre-colonial era. The government is now located in State House, a clearing place for wheeler-dealers, political hangers-on and sycophants.With everything falling apart, a sarcastic joke has taken root from the real cries of desperate Ugandans: ""Tusaba Gavumenti..."", meaning ""We call upon the government..."" or ""We request the government..."" to do this or that for us or help us in our desperation. A certain amount of freedom has taken root in Uganda since 1986 but as most of us are now discovering, not the kind of freedom that is beneficial to a nation. On one hand, the President, Parliament, government, police and army can be criticised without too much fear of consequences most of the time, which is an unquestionable positive. But on the other, the section of Ugandan public life on which much depends --- the corporate community --- is one very few dare criticise. So we have an odd situation in which the head of state can be called names on radio and TV, but the marketing manager of a beer or telecoms company is above criticism because then the advertisement lifeblood of the media, the ""fourth estate"" and crucial watchdog on the public's behalf, will be drained away. Secondly, and most troubling, the laws of Uganda are strictly enforced mainly when an offender or suspect is thought to threaten the President's hold on power through organising a serious opposition party, plotting a military coup or armed rebellion or exposing sensitive secrets of State House. Short of that, anything goes. We can drive without seatbelts, drive both on the left and right sides of the road, forge academic certificates, build on wetlands, evade taxes, bribe magistrates, immigration and licencing officials, import and sell expired and sub-standard goods and life goes on. As a result of this, all standards have dropped. The cost of doing business is high, partly because of the bribes and the burden that comes with fraud. That is why Ugandan companies cannot expand beyond Uganda into other environments that will not tolerate our level of bribery and cutting corners. The worst damage inflicted on Uganda by the NRM has been to destroy the sacredness and prestige of institutions. The public and our growing children now regard a minister or MP as no more dignified and honourable than a boda boda rider, a judge or magistrate much the same way as a money-changing conman. The ability to and importance of working and thinking incrementally in terms of 1-2-3-4-5 step-by-step has been replaced by the impatience to have it all at once and immediately. A 22-year-old just out of university feels ""poor"" if he does not own a fully-furnished house by the age of 24 and a personal house by 28. The idea of working for the long-term has ceased to feel like an honour and call of duty.This is the NRM legacy, of primitive feudal rule, institutionalised corruption, of people with Masters' degrees acting like common criminals, and a lack of dedication in everything we do, that will be with Uganda for decades to come."536,The Daily Monitor,3/27/14,Corruption at Immigration will not stall the national ID project,,UGANDA (95%),Newspaper,Pamela Ankunda -1,ENGLISH,26-Jun-14,,663  words,IMMIGRATION (92%); NATIONAL IDENTITY CARDS (92%); INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); PASSPORTS & VISAS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); IDENTITY SECURITY (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (89%); BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); CITIZENSHIP (78%); NATIONAL SECURITY (73%); WRITERS (71%); COUNTERFEITING (71%),"The Sunday Monitor of March 23 carried a misleading article regarding the national identity card project currently under implementation under the coordination of Ministry of Internal Affairs. We wish to share facts on this very important exercise. For a while, Ugandans have decried the poor service delivery at the Directorate of Immigration - stolen visa money, missing/stolen passports, passport forgeries, slow delivery, congestion and poor services at the department and non-Ugandans being issued with our passports. As part of the need to improve the situation, two regional Immigration offices were opened in Mbale and Mbarara and more will be opened. But as part of deeper solutions to what is obviously a deeper problem, the Minister of Internal Affairs, Gen Aronda Nyakairima, had to give policy direction and guidance. He constituted an inquiry into the corruption, mismanagement and abuse of office at the Department of Citizenship and Immigration. Through the Sunday Monitor article by Chris Obore, you see an attempt to divert the probe into corruption at Immigration under a different guise. The findings of this probe will be made public is in no way related to the identity card project as the Sunday Monitor story alleges. Again, Mr Obore alleges that there is a power struggle to control the ""more than Shs280 billion to be spent in the issuance of the national identity cards"". While indeed the director of Citizenship and Immigration, Mr Godfrey Sasagah, is the accounting officer to National Security Information System Account (ID project account), it is unfair and unjust to insinuate of a fight where the Permanent Secretary, Dr SP Kagoda, has previously written to the Finance ministry in support of the director as accounting officer! This is diversionary because all implementing agencies  of the project have a stake in its successful implementation under the  watchful eye of Finance ministry.  The writer only needed to ask for these - and more documents to write from an informed point of view. However, the Minister of Internal Affairs would be willing to investigate any issues that threaten policy implementation. Yet again, by his own written admission, that ""Gen Aronda reportedly wrote several warnings to Sasagah giving him ultimatums of a few months to stamp out corruption in the directorate"",  Obore exposes the power of an existing force behind his article. Obore has previously decried corruption at Immigration, what is clouding his judgment now? Can the fight against corruption be handled with kid gloves? Has the department of Immigration performed to Uganda's full expectations? Did the previous ID project successfully take off under the Directorate of Immigration? Hadn't it stalled because of lack of direction until the idea to implement it under a multi-sectoral approach was mooted as the only right policy intervention, where different stakeholders are now involved? If there are any lessons from the previous pilot project, it is those lessons that we draw experiences from to make sure the unique identification of citizens is duly done. Gen Nyakairima and the entire work team will not compromise on values of the project - accountability, integrity, accuracy and security in anyway. The national identity card project is on course and we are more than determined to deliver as promised under the uniqueness of the multi-sectoral approach of the key agencies - UBOS, the Electoral Commission, Uganda Registration Services Bureau, Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration, Uganda Bureau of Statistics and National Information Technology-Uganda. From the lowest officer to the Cabinet and the President, it is more than a duty, more than an obligation, more than responsibility; it is a response to national honour. We appeal to Ugandans to turn up in large numbers to enroll for their identity cards at their nearest parish on April 14.

In the recent past, the Judiciary which is the third arm of government, has had its image tainted with real and perceived corruption allegations. Various corruption findings by research organisations such as Transparency International and the Inspectorate of Government (IGG) among others, have always ranked the judiciary among the top two most corrupt government institutions in the country just behind the Uganda Police Force.  It's against this back-drop that Anti-Corruption Coalition Uganda (ACCU) carried out an investigation highlighting the alleged abuse of office in lower courts of law, both urban and rural courts, and the causes of this vice. The survey that targeted 15 courts with a diverse geographical reach of Uganda's five regions (East, West, and North, Central and South) was wrapped up with a report entitled ""Temple of injustice: report highlighting alleged abuse of office in selected magistrates' courts in Uganda"". The magisterial jurisdictions of Nakawa, Buganda Road, Mukono, Mpigi, Apac, Jinja, Matugga, Kasangati and Mityana, Ibanda, Amuria and Moroto, Kisoro and Kabale were sampled. The investigation was carried out over a period of four months (from December 2013 to March 2014). A quick run through the report findings shows that the key drivers of corruption range from poor time keeping, to formalised corruption, non-cash bail turns into cash bail, bail refund lost, and cheating of suspects. According to the executive director of ACCU, Ms Cissy Kagaba, the investigation was mainly to ascertain the different forms, shapes and nature of corruption in lower courts and its effect on justice delivery, image of the judiciary and the common man. These were the the highlights of the main causes of corruption in the lower courts. General moral breakdown in society Moral breakdown has been cited as one of the factors fuelling corruption. Moral break down is a phenomenon in which a major degradation or complete loss of moral values takes place within a particular society. ACCU explains that the abruptness of such kind of degradation may vary depending on the situation and the events that take place within the given society over a certain time. The civil society organisation ponders how a thieving man's acts can be blamed on a phenomenon in society. Is it a question of personal integrity or a general integrity deficiency in society? To this, they cited an example of a magistrate who was recently implicated in an investigation and whose court was thrust in the limelight in 2013. He was transferred to another court in central Uganda pending further investigation by the Judiciary. However, the civil society organisation in its report claims before this investigation could be summed up, a whistleblower approached them with credible evidence of the same magistrate allegedly soliciting for a bribe of Shs1m from him so he could get a favourable hearing.  ACCU asks what then can one blame this magistrate's conduct on? It answers  the same dilemma saying that by large, the conduct of such officers is a mirror of the general moral breakdown in society.  Timid and ignorant public ACCU states that a group of whistleblowers from the Kasangati magisterial area reported cases of senior police officers from Wakiso District with ties in the court, threatening them with violence if they do not back off the magistrate.  Indeed, sections of the public submit to this intimidation and back off. They claim that the broader picture however, is that the public generally appears ignorant, at least from face to face interviews from selected jurisdictions, on among others, how to report corruption cases, court procedure and their rights, all of which offer a fertile breeding ground for the appetite of the officers to corrupt the system and even institutionalise malpractices.  ACCU points out in its report that most forms of corruption are now highly sophisticated with networks so discreet that documentary proof of malpractices is not easily accessible hence catching the culprits is becoming harder.  ACCU states that little and at times, no evidence was found implicating the magistrates in most of these courts though the usual suspects were the court clerks, state attorneys, prisons staff and police officers. However, they alleged in their report how some magistrates have become more sophisticated as they leave no trace of dirty tracks as they allegedly solicited for bribes through their court clerks as their proxies.  Squalid working conditions In its report, ACCU states that judicial officers whom they spoke to, especially those based upcountry, admitted to taking bribes because, as one from northern Uganda said, preferring to remain anonymous, ""The conditions of work are so dire that you are forced to put aside integrity just to survive, this is worsened by the low pay. It is hard life that compels some of us."" The same is reiterated in the Ibanda case.  Weak supervision The civil society organisation makes observations in its report of how courts, especially those upcountry, live in a ""comfort zone"" that offers a ""conducive atmosphere"" for corruption to thrive, seeing that media, civil society and the Judiciary/ IGG flashlight is far detached and cannot catch those implicated in the vice. Recommendations by ACCU 1. The recruitment of court clerks by the Public Service Commission should be revisited.  ACCU says that in an interview with a senior judicial officer, the clerks issue was cited as one of the factors keeping the hands of the Judiciary tied. This is because it cannot discipline the court clerks as they are not employed by it. This makes regulation rather difficult as they pay allegiance to who manages their purse and hires them. ACCU further explains that in their interview with Principal Judge Yorokamu Bamwine on this issue, in his considered opinion, he says that if these officers, who incidentally are the bedrock of corruption in the lower court system, were hired by the judiciary, the situation would be impressively different.  ACCU says that there is every reason to agree with the argument of the Judiciary, given the cases where magistrates who have been named in malpractices are decisively acted upon by the judiciary, especially when and where there is overwhelming evidence and a prima facie case. And that the same is not certainly true of court clerks or State attorneys where Public Service tends to drag its proverbial feet.  ACCU therefore advocates for the clerks and other lower court cadres to be directly recruited by and report to the Judicial Service Commission, that way, house cleaning is eased.  2. Further, it was recommended that civil society groups should continue advocating for better facilitation of the court officials to first of all afford them a conducive environment to deliver justice and also cut on the risks/temptations of indulging in gross malpractices as this could in extreme circumstances, be the root cause of this wanton corruption.  3. ACCU also suggests that the Judiciary, civil society actors and media should focus more light on the lower courts in the up country areas of the nation which are literally left to ""flourish"" with corruption."563,The Daily Monitor,7/6/14,How UDB's Ojangole was acquitted of corruption,,UGANDA (94%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,5-Jul-14,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (73%)",1721  words,CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (92%); EXECUTIVES (91%); CORRUPTION (91%); DEVELOPMENT BANKS (91%); ACQUITTAL (90%); APPOINTMENTS (90%); EVIDENCE (89%); WITNESSES (89%); EMPLOYMENT SERVICES (89%); EXECUTIVE MOVES (78%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (78%); INTERVIEWS (78%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (77%); AUDITS (75%); BOARD CHANGES (74%),"Off the hook. On Monday, the Anti-Corruption Court in Kampala acquitted the CEO of Uganda Development Bank Patricia Ojangole of charges of conflict of interest brought against her by the Inspector General of Government. Below is a summarised version of the judgment by Justice Lawrence Gidudu.  Patricia Ojangole, the accused, is the Chief Executive Officer of Uganda Development Bank (UDB). She was charged with conflict of interest under the Anti-corruption Act. She denied the charges. Prosecution states that the accused while employed as Chief Internal Auditor of UDB and later Acting CEO of the same bank used her position to get appointed as CEO by refusing to disclose her interest to the board of UDB.  In her defence, the accused said she was being persecuted by persons she had faulted in her audit reports. She defended her appointment as being free from conflict or influence because it was clear to all staff from the very beginning that whoever was holding a post in acting capacity was free to apply for substantive appointment. She argued that only the board had power to appoint and she had no influence upon it. To commit the crime of conflict of interest, the accused must deal in the matter in which she has personal interest and be in a position to influence the matter directly or indirectly in the course of her employment. At the conclusion of the trial, it was not in dispute that the accused was an employee of UDB which is a public company owned by government. She also acted in her official capacity as acting CEO during the recruitment of the substantive CEO and had an interest in the substantive job which she eventually applied for, sat interviews and passed leading to her appointment. The case The ingredients in contest are whether the accused failed to disclose her interest and whether she influenced her recruitment into UDB. The prosecution adduced the evidence of a former employee of UDB, two board members, a recruitment consultant and a police officer to support its case. The evidence of prosecution witness, Ms Florence Nabuuma Kabenge, was that she, as acting board secretary, was tasked to initiate the process of recruiting persons to fill vacant positions in the bank. She advised that the bank advertises for a recruitment consultant or it writes to PPDA for a waiver. Her advice was not accepted by the board. Eventually, she was relieved of her duties as acting board secretary. Ligomarc Advocates took over the job of board secretary. It was her evidence that the accused negotiated with Vincent Kaheru, the consultant, to arrive at a figure of Shs12m; Kaheru was co-opted by the board to help in the recruitment. Dr Samuel Sejjaaka, the board chairman who gave evidence as a prosecution witness, gave a background to the scenario that resulted in these charges. It was his evidence that he and others were appointed to the board of UDB in May 2012. The new board tasked management to lay before it the bank portfolio. Management became uncooperative.  The board suspended management and ordered for a forensic audit. The audits by external auditors and internal audit by the accused who was then chief internal auditor revealed fraud. They decided to lay off the entire management team and replaced it. They advertised the posts including that of CEO. It was also his evidence that the board took over the management of the recruitment process and advised all staff in acting capacity to apply for posts advertised if they met the criteria. He stated that they were aware staff members had applied for the jobs advertised and took steps to avoid being influenced. He said he was aware the accused had applied for the job of CEO and that whatever tasks she performed regarding the process of recruitment, it was on instructions of the board. Mr Kaheru, the consultant, also testified that he was first contacted by Ms Harriet Omoding, a board member, interesting him to participate in the recruitment exercise by the board. He was eventually also contacted by the accused. Kaheru was eventually contracted by the board and provided the short listing tool. He also participated in the interviews and made a report to the board after the exercise. He was engaged in person because the fees quoted by his firm were considered high by the board. Kaheru denied negotiating with the accused, saying he was just asked to lower his price. He denied being influenced by the accused. He also denied influencing the board, saying his role did not give him control over the process. Ms Omoding, who was the board member in charge of short listing, stated that she was the one who knew Kaheru and contacted him to provide expertise to the recruitment process. She was the one who instructed the accused to contact Kaheru. She found no fault in the accused applying for the post of CEO and addressing her application to ""the recruitment team"" because it was the board that interviewed the applicants. The accused in her defence denied influencing her appointment. She testified that people she faulted in her audit reports and lost jobs in the bank want her out in turn. It was her evidence that the bank was run unprofessionally and the level of risk to loans was shockingly high. Ms Ojangole attributed her problems to staff in the bank who owed allegiance to those that had been dismissed because of the audit reports she had issued to the board.  She denied having power to influence the board. She denied concealing her interest on grounds that it was common knowledge that everybody in acting capacity was asked to apply for substantive appointment. It was her evidence that she would be excluded from some board meetings because she was expected to apply.  During cross-examination, the accused named the people behind her prosecution as Nabuuma, former CEO Etou Gabriel, and Shallot Mucunguzi who had been dismissed for leaking official mails.  Ojangole testimony  She testified that the board expected her to apply and it was not necessary to inform the board because it was already aware.  It was the submission of Mr Sydney Asubo for the state that the fact that the accused did not disclose her interest in applying for the job and participated in the various correspondences and tasks, she gained undue advantage.  It was his view that she committed the offence of conflict of interest. He canvassed the proposition that if she had disclosed her interest then even if she participated she would not commit a crime.  In reply, Nsubuga Mubiru, the learned counsel for the accused, asked me to find the accused not guilty. He criticised the prosecution for adducing two versions of evidence. The first version is by Nabuuma and Daniel Acato, who testified that the accused participated in proceedings that recruited a consultant who prepared the interviews in which she was an applicant without disclosing her interest.  The second version is by four witnesses who testified that they were aware of the accused's interest in the job and were not surprised that she applied. These two versions are adduced by the same side and are clearly contradictory. They were not reconciled. I will return to the two submissions later.  The law under which the accused has been charged requires that there should exist both a personal interest and the accused should be in a position to influence the matter.  A conflict of interest would only become a legal matter if a person tries or indeed succeeds in influencing the outcome of a decision for personal benefit. In this case, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused used her official position to influence the decision to appoint her CEO. The prosecution has not accused her of applying for the job. She had every right to apply and attend interviews once shortlisted.  Mr Asubo asked me to find the accused guilty on the basis that she did not write to the board disclosing her interest in applying for the job.  The Act  The Anti-Corruption Act does not indicate whether disclosure of conflict of interest should be made even when the one to whom the information is to be given is already in the know. Would that be disclosure anyway? Mr Asubo suggested that disclosure is mandatory whether the other party knows it or not.  To disclose is to reveal what was previously not known to the other party. The crime is committed when the other party acts innocently only to discover later that an interest has been concealed and a party has gained from that concealment. The prosecution evidence showed that the board had made known to all staff that they should apply for substantive appointments if they qualified. Innocent  It is clear to me that there was nothing to disclose. Both the accused and the board were aware that positions in UDB were due for filling through open competition and that staff of UDB including the accused were going to apply. It would be a circus to pretend that the accused was disclosing that she was going to apply.  I am unable to accept the prosecution submission that the accused should have, as a formality, written to the board and from there her further dealings with the board would be immune to conflict. That would make disclosure appear a mere ritual. Sejjaaka said the board, after informing staff to apply, took steps to avoid compromising the process. With this evidence in the prosecution file, it is a wonder why we are here.  I believe these prosecution witnesses that there was no room for the accused to peddle any influence. Being acting CEO did not put her in a position of influence. Even the consultant called by the prosecution scoffed at any suggestion that he would be influenced by the accused in the recruitment process. If these prosecution witnesses say the accused was not in a position to influence them, where else is evidence that she was in such a position except from the bar?  The lady and gentleman assessors advised me to acquit the accused. They observed that the prosecution assembled two versions of the case which were contradictory. They found no influence.  I entirely agree with the assessors' opinion. It would be clumsy for the law to criminalise a person for holding a position of influence. I believe the accused's version that the charges are malicious because while internal auditor, she unearthed a lot of rot which led to the dismissal of the entire management."566,The Daily Monitor,7/23/14,Speaker appoints committee to investigate corruption at NSSF,,UGANDA (79%),Newspaper,Yasiin Mugerwa -1,ENGLISH,23-Jul-14,,603  words,INVESTIGATIONS (94%); APPOINTMENTS (92%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (79%); SOCIAL SECURITY (78%); MUTUAL FUNDS (78%); DIVESTITURES (71%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (69%); INTERVIEWS (69%),"Lawmakers who have been appointed to investigate allegations of corruption at the National Social Security Fund yesterday promised to ""leave no stone unturned"" while carrying out their assignment. A five-member Select Committee named by Speaker Rebecca Kadaga was yesterday instructed to probe the allegations of nepotism and unfair recruitment at NSSF; illegal purchase of Umeme shares; irregular disposal of the NSSF assets and any other matter related to the mismanagement. Appointees grateful Deputy Speaker Jacob Oulanyah, who chaired the House yesterday, read out Ms Kadaga's letter dated July 17, appointing former Masaka District LCV chairperson, now Kalungu East MP, Mr Vincent Bamulangaki Ssempijja (independent) to chair the NSSF probe. Mr Ssempijja will be assisted by Kalungu West MP Joseph Ssewungu (DP); Ann Maria Nankabirwa (NRM, Kyankwanzi Woman); Alex Ruhunda (NRM, Fort portal Municipality) and Theopista Nabulya Ssentongo (Workers rep.). ""We are grateful to the Speaker for trusting us and we are going to take on the challenge. We are going to execute the assignment with zeal and professionalism,"" Mr Alex Ruhunda said. ""In our investigations into the operations of NSSF, we are going to ensure that there is justice..."" The Speaker's instructions are for the investigation to commence immediately. The committee is expected to convene during the course of the week to draw up a programme of action. Ms Nankabirwa, who was on the House Select Committee which investigated allegations of corruption in the energy sector last year, told Daily Monitor that they were ready for the assignment. She will be remembered for her probing skills during the energy sector inquiry which ended with the committee recommending termination of Umeme's contract, citing several irregularities in the concession. While other MPs led by Kibanda MP, Mr Sam Otada questioned Ms Kadaga's decision to constitute a committee that lacked a lawyer, Mr Oulanyah reminded him that his hands were tied since the Speaker's directive had been put in writing. Mr Otada said issues at NSSF were ""grave and controversial"" and therefore, having a probe team without a lawyer would be risking too much. ""This is an order put in writing by the Speaker, I cannot undo what the Speaker did,"" Mr Oulanyah said. Mr Otada however, promised to follow-up the matter with the Speaker who was reported out of the country. The Speaker's decision to set up a select committee was informed by the resolution of Parliament two weeks ago after Aruu MP, Mr Odongo Otto, tabled a motion alleging, among other issues, that the fund managers had irregularly bought shares in Umeme, that the Inspector General of Government Irene Mulyagonja, helped her daughter, Elizabeth Nabakooza, to get a job at the NSSF without going through formal interviews. NSSF to cooperate In a statement released yesterday, NSSF said it will cooperate with the inquiry, which now joins a list of previous House probes into the affairs of the multi-trillion shilling Fund. This fund is entrusted with the safe-keeping and judicious investment of savings belonging to more than 400,000 private sector workers. The Fund has suffered decades of internal strife with almost all its managing directors being forced out under corruption allegations, with some of them either being found at fault or still remain in court. Former Finance minister Ezra Suruma also lost his job following a House probe into what came to be known as the Temangalo scandal in which the Fund bought land belonging to Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi and associates for more than Shs11 billion. ymugerwa@ug.nationmedia.com"571,The Daily Monitor,8/30/14,"Sadly, corruption is no longer an anomaly in our society",,UGANDA (79%),Newspaper,David F.

Over the years we have had junk helicopters, ghost soldiers, ghost pensioners, supply of air, fake tenders and so many others. The latest round of looting has broken out in the infrastructure sector, which should not be a surprise.  Looters migrate to where the public money is being disbursed. When the money was being spent on Universal Primary Education, we had ghost teachers, ghost students and briefcase companies getting tenders to build substandard or even ghost schools.  Now the money is being spent on roads, bridges, hydro-electric dams and railway lines, the looting has gone there. We know we have corruption but many of us fail to appreciate its true extent.

If you open your mind and look around you will observe that corruption is no longer an anomaly. Corruption is now the norm from which the honest few deviate. It has grown into a massive industry - what Chinweizu called ""the Steal Industry"". It exists to prey upon public funds and resources so that they may be diverted from being for the benefit of the many to being for the benefit of the very few. The Steal Industry engages thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of people across its value chain.  These include, both local and foreign: politicians; technocrats; corporations; businessmen; consultants; and financial and legal services professionals. Huge networks operating in the Steal Industry regularly derail, delay and eat up legitimate and well justified projects.  If there are no projects, then the Steal Industry will take some legitimate public needs and cause public projects to be initiated just so that the public coffers may be opened up and public money ""eaten"". The gravitational pull of the massive Steal Industry has warped the legitimate systems and turned them upside down.  So instead of being people who, out of moral compunction, expose misconduct, illegal or dishonest activity within an organisation, in Uganda's Steal Industry, ""whistle blowers"" are usually looters who report other players because they have been left out of the deal or to divert attention away from themselves. The institutions that are supposed to fight corruption are also as often misused by ""whistle blowers"" to punish and harass those who dare to eat alone or to share with the wrong players and no big looters (master looters, if you like) ever get seriously entangled in their nets. The exposure of the Steal Industry has become ritualised.  With each scandal, we hear about the large sum that has been looted and the mechanics of the looting. We are outraged. The press maximise their sales by feeding us headlines of the scandal for a couple of weeks.  Players are called in to the police to make statements. Others go before Parliament, so that MPs may show off their dramatic but ineffective methods of inquisition.  Blame aggregates to the lowest possible level.  Trials, if they commence at all, drag along, if not completely stall.  A few are convicted but most get acquitted. We move on and our minds rationalise the situation. We assure ourselves that all is well. But the Steal Industry never sleeps.  Day and night, unimaginable amounts of public money are being looted. What they can't loot they waste. The scandals we get to hear about are just the tip of the iceberg. dfkm@afmpanga.co.ug twitter @dfkm1970"572,The Daily Monitor,9/1/14,Fighting corruption begins with you,,UGANDA (96%),Newspaper,Editorial -1,ENGLISH,31-Aug-14,,430  words,CORRUPTION (96%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); BRIBERY (89%); ETHICS (79%); EMBEZZLEMENT (79%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (79%); BANKING & FINANCE (78%); PUBLIC FINANCE (78%); BUDGETS (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (77%); EXTORTION (74%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (74%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (74%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (73%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (72%); ECONOMIC NEWS (72%); BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (70%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (70%); CHILDREN (68%),"Corruption in Uganda has become endemic and systemic. Public funds are misused by those entrusted with responsibility to use it for the good of citizens. A report released last week by the Inspectorate of Government and the Economic Policy Research Centre (EPRC) at Makerere University found that Ugandans had paid Shs166 billion in bribes last year.  Both grand and petty corruption thrives in Uganda. Colossal sums of money are being embezzled by high-ranking public officials while lower cadres extort money from the public in exchange for service delivery. In 2011, the World Bank estimated that Uganda was losing more than $500 million a year through institutionalised corruption. Uganda has over the years established laws and systems to fight corruption. By 1970, the Prevention of Corruption Act (1970) had been enacted; then the Inspector General of Government Statute (1988), the Anti-Corruption Act (2009) and the Enforcement of the Leadership Code of Conduct Act (2002) were also put in place. There is also the institution of the Auditor General, the Police CIID, the Budget Monitoring and Accountability Unit, Parliament's Public Accounts Committee, Anti-Corruption Court and PPDA Act, among other institutions tasked with combating corruption. However, even with numerous legal frameworks and institutions for fighting corruption in place, detection and prevention of corruption, as well as enforcement of anti-corruption laws, has been weak. The reason for this failure is largely an apathetic public that is often given to corruption tendencies. A large section of the public has condoned corruption and bribery in one way or the other. This is clear in the EPRC report which lists police, district administrations, public officials, schools and town councils as the most complained about government departments. If we want a corruption-free Uganda, we - parents, guardians and teachers - must instill values of honesty, transparency and discipline in our children so that they grow up knowing that corruption is an unacceptable behaviour. Eliminating corruption starts at individual level. We cannot hold our leaders accountable if we, the citizens, are promoting the vice we supposedly detest. More importantly, the government should take note of key issues the EPRC report raises: the current challenges faced by the Ombudsman in trying to fight corruption, especially limited manpower and the shortage of funds. Finance minister Maria Kiwanuka's pledge to increase funding to the IGG to fight graft is commendable. We await the fulfilment of this promise."573,The Daily Monitor,9/16/14,Bridge policy enactment gaps to fight corruption,,UGANDA (96%),Newspaper,Moustapha Ndiaye -1,ENGLISH,15-Sep-14,,994  words,CORRUPTION (93%); TRENDS (90%); ANNUAL REPORTS (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); FINANCIAL CRIME COUNTERMEASURES (89%); SOCIAL JUSTICE (89%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (89%); STATISTICS (89%); PUBLIC FINANCE (78%); POLLS & SURVEYS (78%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (78%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (78%); MONEY LAUNDERING (78%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (78%); AUDITS (78%); BUDGETS (76%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (76%); DEVELOPMENT BANKS (76%); ECONOMIC NEWS (76%); LEGISLATION (75%); BANKING & FINANCE REGULATION (75%); ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS (73%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (70%); MISAPPROPRIATION (68%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (56%),"The Inspectorate of Government (IGG) recently released the Fourth Annual Report on Tracking Corruption Trends in Uganda, which includes data from the National Governance Baseline Survey conducted by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (Ubos). The report clearly shows that corruption is still widespread in Uganda and remains a major constraint on economic development and poverty reduction. At least eight of every 10 Ugandans believe that corruption is a serious problem. The government has demonstrated its willingness to address this challenge by putting in place a robust institutional and legal anti-corruption framework. However, the full implementation of anti-corruption laws and accountability mechanisms remains a challenge.  While substantive progress has been made in addressing corruption, the efforts have principally focused on detection. Much more needs to be achieved in the way of concrete enforcement actions such as the recovery of misappropriated assets and the application of sanctions, which remains the weakest link in the accountability chain. The World Bank acknowledges the government's ongoing efforts to strengthen public finance management and procurement systems, including the decentralisation of the civil service payroll. We also welcome the government's leadership in fostering demand for good governance, as demonstrated by the implementation of the budget transparency initiative and IG's social accountability monitoring programme (SACM). Government's efforts Likewise, the government should be commended for providing a conducive environment for media to report on corruption without hindrance. On the legislative side, in the last two years the government has amended the public procurement and disposal of assets legislation to enhance enforcement, improve local content, and strengthen mechanisms for redress by aggrieved bidders. It has also passed the Anti-Money Laundering Act to prohibit and prevent money laundering. Government efforts are beginning to yield positive results. For instance, the detection and deletion of 8,000 ghost workers from the payroll saved the government at least Shs3.7 billion in just three months. Similarly, anti-corruption agencies have been successful in recovering and saving funds as a result of investigations and prosecutions. The IG saved funds worth Shs25.6 billion in 2013. In addition, The Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP) reported at least Shs4.1 billion recovered as a consequence of corruption probes within the National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS) and Global Fund projects. These are just a few examples of resources that could have better supported Uganda's economic development.  What is required More needs to be done to bridge the implementation gap in the fight against corruption.  On a regular basis, and through the annual audit reports, we see significant leakages of public resources and a worrying disregard for systems and procedures put in place to ensure value for money. For example, an analysis of the Auditor General's report for FY 2012/13 indicates that more than Shs280 billion worth of expenditure had not been properly accounted for. The recently discovered payment of Shs24 billion to a road construction company without proper due diligence suggests the systems developed by the government are not being effectively implemented by accounting officers. Disseminating information as widely as possible and empowering citizens to hold the government accountable is a strong anti-corruption tool.  In this regard, the government should fully implement the Access to Information Act as a key enabler of demand for good governance, as well as follow the example of its budget transparency platform to cover all public resources, including revenues from the extractive industry. Moreover, the common misconception that corruption can only be tackled by anti-corruption agencies enables other government agencies to relinquish their role in enforcing accountability systems. The Fourth Annual Report on Tracking Corruption Trends highlights that absenteeism by health and education workers in Uganda is widespread. This form of quiet corruption should be dealt with by the responsible accounting officers to ensure effective service delivery. Offices and individuals with management and oversight functions should play a significant role in addressing the ""soft"" corruption tendencies and help tackle prevention aspects, allowing the mainstream anti-corruption agencies to focus on the ""harder"" forms of corruption. The report also notes that failure to sanction public officials accused of corruption, or to implement audit recommendations, is undermining the government's efforts to eliminate corruption. The government should thus go beyond identification and improve its track record regarding administrative and criminal sanctions. Recovering misaapropriated money Finally, the implementation of measures to facilitate the recovery of misappropriated funds and assets creates strong disincentives for those likely to engage in corruption.  In this regard, we commend the IG in their efforts to recover funds in convicted cases. The effort by the Judiciary and DPP to freeze assets of individuals in suspected cases of embezzlement is also a step in the right direction. To further bolster work in this area, however, Parliament should expedite the passage of the Anti-Corruption amendment Bill, which contains a clause to facilitate the confiscation of assets and recovery of misappropriated funds. In addition, the failure to pass the Leadership Code Amendment Bill inhibits IG's enforcement of the asset declaration clause under the Leadership Code Act. The fight against corruption in Uganda requires the implementation of measures that will deny the culprits the proceeds of their crimes and a stronger commitment towards the application of sanctions.

I asked her about how she could make ends meet with the little remuneration she earned. Corruption did not start with the NRM Administration even though lately the NRM leaders have tended to accept and glorify it as a legitimate instrument of governance. If it had, Uganda under the UPC would not have enacted the Anti-Corruption Act of 1970 which, in many respects, is similar or better than the NRM party current Anti-Corruption Act of 2009.  Shortly before I was appointed Minister of Commerce in 1986, I met a senior civil servant. I asked her about how she could make ends meet with the little remuneration she earned. She said: ""We have mastered the tricks of survival. For instance, I am the accountant officer in this department and in charge of construction contracts. We advertise for tenders for construction bidders. Many of them know that it takes more than the actual cost of constructing a given building to win the tender. I therefore negotiate with all bidders in the knowledge that the successful bidder will be the one who offers me the highest and not the lowest bonus over and above what will be the actual cost of the building."" She continued: ""Currently, I have just signed a contract for building a government youth hostel. The contractual figure for which we have signed is Shs750 million. The winning bidder and I secretly know that after Government has paid this company that amount. Shs50 million is to be privately returned to me as my commission. That is why accounting officers in Government are not beggars."" I posed the moral question, ""Is that not stealing from taxpayers of this country?"" Her response was philosophical. ""Ministers and Permanent Secretaries are corruptly pocketing billions of shillings and amassing great wealth and you have the courage to attack small fish?"" She then justified her belief by a question from the Holy Books. ""You first remove the huge beams from the eyes of the big men and women in the leaderships of this country. Thereafter, it will be much easier to remove small specks from ours"". Sadly, it is ironic today that our leaders appear to be busy complaining about tiny specks in the eyes of our small public officials while wallowing in the ill-gotten beams of wealth applauding and rewarding their colleagues, families and friends for the acquisition and retention of wealth unlawfully. In the Uganda of today, the saying that ""man eateth where he worketh"" has become the rule rather than the exception of survival and good living. Public officials who do not indulge in these wrongs or whose integrity forbids them to do them are despised and shunned in the modern politics of Uganda. It is those who indulge in corrupt tendencies, ignore or violate the law who are welcomed, appointed and applauded establishment of this country. Political support and votes are freely given, not to the good and principled, but to candidates who are corrupt or through corruption are wealthier members of society. It does not take a genius to know that in the Uganda of today, both the ruling party and many members of Opposition parties are sustained in their respective positions by corruption and abuse of offices. With the kind of governance and Opposition politics that operate in Uganda, the belief and patience of the people in clean and principled leadership have for long disappeared to the extent that even hope for change is beginning to be a dream of the uncertain and distant future. Ugandans are busy speculating about who will succeed President Museveni and that Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi and his band of vocal and clandestine supporters will defeat and replace him. Soon, time and events will tell. The other day, the press published a rumour that Opposition leaders were in serious talks with Mr Mbabazi for a possible alliance. Yet, this is the same leader who has stood by and done very little while his own office and its senior officials have been accused or convicted of theft, embezzlement and corruption. His own support cadres have been branded by the NRMO leaders as behaving like thugs and terrorists. Meanwhile, the current governing oligarchy has declared the rest of the Opposition parties to be deceivers and enemies of the people of Uganda. Who is who then in the leadership stakes of the Pearl of Africa? My late friend ""Sir"" John Bageire who was a businessman, had a motto in his living room: ""God I may be too busy today and forget you. But Lord, never forget me"". In Uganda, most politicians have forgotten Ugandans and why voters chose them but the Lord God Almighty will remember their iniquities and the plight of people who dwell in the most beautiful and picturesque country he ever created and redeem them from bad politics.

The fight against corruption will remain a big challenge but not because the laws are weak . Ethics Minister Simon Lokodo was spot-on when he said the country has an excellent legal framework to fight corruption, but that it has been watered down by apathy. There is more to it! Some analysts refer to Uganda as a failing state but that is an understatement. By Jove, make no mistake about it; the state with all the instruments of coercion, such as an increasingly politicised as well as militarised police force and one of the best infantry fighting forces in Africa, at its disposal, is still very powerful; if not more powerful than it has ever been. Nevertheless, it is not only annoyingly quite ineffective in many aspects of public policy; it actually is decomposing slowly but surely! The symptoms are glaring, aren't they? Anyhow, Corruption with all its multiple facets started as a benign growth during the past regimes but has under the present one progressed not only to full-blown malignancy but has, sadly, reached the metastatic stage. Because the possession of wealth confers upon the possessor an honorific stature in a society which glorifies those who steal and become rich fast and upholds the philosophy of veneration of the wealthy, people engage in conspicuous consumption which in turn fuels corruption. Conspicuous consumption is the way the so called 'filthy rich' demonstrate their wealth and thus their success in a primitive but sometimes deadly war of competition for recognition. By building or purchasing mansions in the upscale neighbourhoods of Kampala, buying SUVs with engines with the horsepower of Lorries, organising multi-million wedding parties and some such other contrivances, they gain the respect and admiration of not only their peers but also their subordinates and the general public. Political economist Thorstein Veblen departed from mainstream neoclassical analysis of economic behaviour by rejecting the simplistic claim that consumers make purchases based on rationality and disparaged those forms of conspicuous consumption waste that is practiced daily by the wealthy which one of the erstwhile socialist comrades of the President once described as primitive accumulation. He identified a propensity for emulation in societies where people compete for recognition and called the phenomenon 'pecuniary emulation', which could be at the core of the corruption spiral in Uganda. When big fish get away with corruption small fish emulate them. The motive for pecuniary emulation, which is the imitation of the spending habits of peers and those above them on the social ladder, fuels corruption and perpetuates it. According to Veblen, therefore, the propensity for emulation is among the strongest economic motives and if I may paraphrase him, is at the core of the corruption enigma. When he was still doctrinaire and embellished socialist ideals President Museveni argued in favour of creating a middle class. This line was perpetuated by the cadre instructors at the former Kyankwanzi School of Political Education. Such argument presupposed the existence of a lower and upper class and meant that a middle one had to be contrived to fit the dialectic narrative of socialism and development. Corruption was probably not envisioned by him. Revolutions can be 'hijacked' and deliberately or inadvertently derailed. No matter how far from capital the debate about social classes in capitalism has veered off course, Karl Marx's conceptions continue to define the content, shape and fallacies of the debate on corruption in an oblique way. Those ignoring Marx's placing of people in social classes according to their relationship to the means of production do so at their own academic and political peril. By placing people in classes that are determined by wealth, society is inadvertently contributing to metastasis of the corruption disease, which is presenting itself with symptoms and characteristics similar to those of a gangrenous cancer.

The popular restaurant patronised by many office workers is no more. The criss-crossing railway lines are clogged up with many dead train engines and railway wagons.  What happened to this place which used to be alive, teeming with very busy people? Now I hear a lot of talk in the media and such important institutions as Parliament about grand projects to build a standard gauge railway line from Mombasa to many destinations in Uganda and going through to Rwanda, costing billions of dollars. Any improvement in infrastructure is good. But the starting point should be analysing of why the existing railway system died. Did it die because of the gauge? There were many attempts to improve it, such as the modern workshop at Nalukolongo built with a foundry that could fabricate a lot of things. During the youth stage of the regime when service, not regime survival, was still primary, some cattle wagons were modified to render commuter passenger services to areas around Kampala, especially during peak times. What happened to the railway system to the extent that there are many areas with railway lines and there are now adults born in those areas who have never seen a train moving on those lines? What happened to railways land, to railway quarters for workers and to the skilled manpower developed over a long time? These questions need answers so that when a standard gauge railway is built, we are sure that it will attract traffic on the system. Sometime back, it was said that public ownership was the problem and so the railways were privatised. Why has the private sector also failed to revive the railway system? If it is not making money, why would private business people be interested in it? Could the attraction have been the properties but not the core railway business? Most railway assets inland are gone, where did they go and what has the country gained? Perhaps ongoing investigations will discover the mystery behind the private sector interest when there are no apparent profitable business activities taking place. So let us visualise the standard gauge in place, assuming that the tendering wars will allow its construction, will the road haulage companies that have filled the vacuum disappear? There is now heavy investment in heavy trucks and all attendant services and also public investment in weigh bridges, customs inspection services, etc. Will the corruption that ate up the railway system not eat up the new standard railway system? This is the crux of the matter. The problem is not the railway gauge.  This is the same with policy initiatives such as Naads. The problem is not the personnel or even its conceptual framework but the system within which it operates. All component parts of a corrupt system become corrupted, otherwise they cannot survive. The governing operating system in this country is corrupted, so corruption is systemic, meaning that corruption has become essential for its survival. Therefore, replacing civilians with soldiers in Naads will not help because Naads has corruption in its foundation system. The first founding corruption building block was to politicise it rather than professionalise it. Militarisation that more entrenches its politicisation will even make it worse as its political rational will become more evident. For example, Maj Rubaramira could never have become part of the new Naads if he had not joined NRM. Clearly, membership in NRM is a requirement for employment in Naads, consequently making it institutionally part of the NRM party.

Even with vast oil resources in the Delta region of Nigeria, it still has its citizens lining up at petrol stations for fuel. Ghana's currency, the Cedi, has suffered from inflation to the extent that the government has recently asked the International Monetary Fund to facilitate the fiscal management of its economy. An abundance of oil can cause serious challenges to the economic development of a country. The challenges to the economy can arise as result of corruption, an overvalued exchange rate, excessive foreign borrowing, unsustainable high wages and over spending by government. This sounds like an apt description of the Ugandan economy. Good financial management can ameliorate some of these challenges. Other economic policy solutions may entail the use of special financial institutions and instruments, which are useful in managing commodity price unpredictability in a country that is dependent on revenues from the sale of its natural resources. In his article ""Protecting developing economies from price shocks"", Randall Dodd contends that oil price unpredictability makes it difficult to maintain budget discipline. This difficulty may lead to a distortion of the economy, which can result into political instability, let alone its effects on the poor. Financial institutions such as stabilisation funds can act as a reserve to cushion government budgets. Alternatively, hedging instruments such as futures, options and other derivatives can protect governments by shifting some of the risk to investors willing to bear it. Reducing the risk of oil price unpredictability comes at a cost of giving up some revenues when the price of oil is unexpectedly high. However, governments are not always politically ready to give up that windfall, considering the political patronage networks the oil revenues create to sustain their survival. In his novel East of Eden, the American writer John Steinbeck described the unreliability of natural resource wealth generated by farming. He concluded: ""And it never failed that during the dry years the people forgot about the rich years, and during the wet years they lost all memory of the dry years. It was always that way."" The inadequate or lack of compensation of evicted communities around the oil fields, rendering them landless, a lack of clear and shared vision on how oil price unpredictability will be managed to cushion the economy from its effects, among others, in the management of our oil industry, are indicators that Ugandans may not survive the consequences of oil price instability, and thus the oil curse! One way of reducing the incidence of both gross fiscal mismanagement and corruption is to require a high degree of transparency in the government budget(s). Considering supplementary budgets are the order of the day in Uganda, this is a long shot!

I have chosen to call corruption in the Uganda Citizenship and Immigration Control Board naked because everyone, including foreigners, knows about it. Many people have been victims of or forced to accept corruption if they are to have their pressing needs catered for.  The Prime Minister, senior ministers and public servants know about it. Some of them benefit through it. Others do not care whether it exists or damages the interests of Uganda. I have been reliably informed that the mention of my name and those who expose and fight against corruption and abuse of office are bad news amongst the corrupt and wrong-doers in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Our beliefs, campaigns and dialogues against those who condone or derive benefits from corruption and abuse of office are resented or hated by them. We have been identified as the enemies of the corrupt and we should be silenced or neutralised. There is an added reason for the resentment we encounter. Some of us have for years had easy access to the centres of political and governmental power where we interact freely and frankly with the highest and senior rulers and public officials who possess the ultimate authority to discipline culprits but who often exhibit reluctance to act decisively. Our campaigns to have the police behave and act more professionally, competently and pro-people are well known nationally and often embarrass even the most liberal president, prime minister, minister or permanent secretary and thousands other responsible public officials. On corruption and abuse of office, good spirited citizens have had audiences, discussions and recommendations with the highest public officials with very disappointing reactions and actions. It is this negativity and lack of responses which prompted to write a piece in this column on January 4 titled ""Practice of government not responding to complaints is embarrassing."" I have had professional and political discussions with the responsible ministers and bureaucrats in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. I have even offered to participate in a fact-finding missions or remedial voyages of discovery about corruption and abuses office, but these offers are not taken seriously. My own experience in dealing with the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Control is that it is corrupt, inefficient and rotten to the core. Applicants for citizenship, passports and other services emanating from that institution are often denied the required services and common courtesies. There is evidence that some officials from the ministry actively demand bribes and illegal favours. The minister of Internal Affairs, Gen Aronda Nyakairima, was reported suggesting that there should be a change in the way citizenship and immigration industry should be organised and administered. His reported proposal that immigration business should be done by the bureaucrats of the ministry without the supervision, control and participation of the Citizenship and Immigration Board of Directors is devoid of the reality of today. Through corruption and abuse of office, passports and other official documents and instruments have been corruptly and illegally issued or authorised. Sadly, even after paying colossal sums of money, some applicants have no guarantee that their applications for whatever service will be considered favourably or successfully. Notorious cases include those of a minister who was not even responsible for immigration but was considered to be an intimate confidant of the colleague in charge. The minister allegedly demanded and $40,000 but the victim's application for dual citizenship of Uganda has not been successful. In another case, the unsuccessful applicant paid Shs35 million for a passport but did not get it. Mr Prime Minister and minister of Internal Affairs, if there is love and patriotism of country and conscience about public duty, act now, not in words but deeds. Everyone is embarrassed by the revelation of these blatant acts of corruption and abuse of office.  If nothing is done about them, none of us will have any rest in Uganda.

Against a background of previously chaotic scenes in parliament over the issue, Zuma took head-on the question of when he would ""pay back the money"" -- a now popular chant both inside and outside the national assembly. ""Never have I thought when I would pay back the money,"" Zuma said. He noted that he did not know how much of the $24 million spent on ""security upgrades"" at his rural home in Nkandla in the eastern KwaZulu-Natal province he might be required to repay. ""That needs determination by those authorised to do so,"" he said, adding that he had ""never dodged"" the question. Public Protector Thuli Madonsela, the country's ombudswoman, found that Zuma and his family had ""unduly benefited"" from the work on his home, which included a swimming pool and cattle kraal, and recommended that he repay some of the money. Under public pressure, Zuma then appointed the minister of police to determine how much he should repay. The minister, who is a Zuma appointee, has not yet made a recommendation. The amount of $24 million would buy several of South Africa's most luxurious homes in the economic capital Johannesburg or on the scenic Cape coast. Architects and contractors have been accused of inflating costs by Zuma's supporters, while critics say he could not have been unaware of what was happening at his own home. Zuma also denied that he had interfered with police and prosecuting authorities to ensure there were no further investigations into 700 other corruption charges against him, which were dropped shortly before he became president in 2009. Zuma was prevented from answering questions for almost an hour as opposition lawmakers fought to have a full explanation of his position on the Nkandla scandal. But once he began speaking, he appeared to have defused the situation -- for the day at least -- and at one stage even had his arch-enemies in the Economic Freedom Fighters chuckling at his comments. The opposition has demanded that a new date should be set for Zuma to provide a full answer to the question of when he will ""pay back the money""."628,The Daily Monitor,3/19/15,"I will not indulge in corruption, says minister",,UGANDA (93%),Newspaper,FRANCIS MUGERWA &RONALD TUMUSIIME -1,ENGLISH,20-Mar-15,,308  words,BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (90%); SENIOR CITIZENS (90%); PUBLIC FINANCE (90%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (90%); APPOINTMENTS (90%); BUDGETS (89%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (78%); CORRUPTION (77%); AGING (73%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (70%); APPROVALS (69%),"Pledge.

While meeting a group of elderly persons in Kibaale Town at the weekend, Mr Kasaija said, ""I have high integrity as an elder. I will not indulge in financial irregularities."" More than 60 leaders and the elderly from Bunyoro sub-region petitioned the Finance minister to include funds for the Sage programme in the 2015/2016 National Budget. The programme that started in 2012, is being piloted in 14 districts in Uganda. Under the programme, government pays a monthly stipend of Shs25,000 to the elderly. Mr Francis Kabagambe, the Hoima District chairman of the elderly, who presented the petition on behalf of the delegation, said leaders in Bunyoro appreciate and commend the government for putting in place mechanisms for promoting social protection but asked for expansion and sustainability of Sage. ""We note with concern that despite the above commitments, the government of Uganda has not yet come up with a clear road map for the national roll out of the Sage,"" the petition read in part. Mr Kasaija said Cabinet recently approved the programme and will be rolled out countrywide. ""Cabinet discussed the programme and observed that it had a profound success,"" he said.

Sebei Diocese has a very unusual way of fighting corruption by arranging marathons, says Mr Lucas Chelangat the Program Manager Sebei Diocese Community Development and Empowerment. According to him, there's a high level of apathy and residents no longer trust government systems in place. ""People are tired of many empty and unfulfilled promises.

However, he now appears to have joined the harem of judicial eunuchs. J Last Sunday, New Vision sought my opinion on senior advocate Peter Mulira's letter to the learned Lord Chief Justice Bart Katureebe on corruption in the Uganda Judiciary. Mulira was mourning the reported and proven rampant corruption in the Judiciary.  Mulira's letter was copied to President Museveni. I have occasionally disagreed with Mr Mulira on some legal issues and their interpretations. On this occasion, however, I am in total agreement with him. The evidence exposing corruption cases, partiality and biased or corrupt judgments by judges, judicial officers and clerks is heavier than all the crude oil in South Arabia. President Museveni himself knows most of the serious offences in the Judiciary but chooses to utilise them for political advantage. The Speaker of Parliament knows about it but politically ignores it because she has hidden the petition in her inner chambers and failed to organise the debate murk that has eaten into the very souls of judges, registrars and magistrates. Retired Chief Justice Benjamin Odoki was deeply aware and often spoke about it but failed to act or combat it effectively. The newly appointed Chief Justice is painfully aware of how destructive of justice it is and that is why all Ugandans are anxiously waiting for the execution of his public promise to fight it successfully or else. Many of us who admire the courage Justice  Katureebe has demonstrated elsewhere will be bitterly disappointed if he fails to show soon that he is dead serious. Very recently and in earnest, and publicly, the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, Maj Gen Kahinda Otafiire, described it as a cancer in Uganda which needs to be removed surgically. Accusatory reports He recently named the most corrupt of the judges, including the dearest and closest to his own party's leadership. The chairperson and members of the Judicial Service Commission have received many accusatory reports from members of the law society and the public about the same. Other accusatory reports have come from Members of Parliament and public institutions naming judges and judicial officers who are unworthy to hold judicial offices of their respective posts. The catalogue of grave offenders stretches in the Judiciary to the pinnacle. The learned and often brave Principal Judge Yorokamu Bamwine, has often and publicly spoken against and condemned this crippling epidemic in the Judiciary. Very recently, this columnist was moved to tears when he personally witnessed the brutal assault on the proper and constitutional administration of justice in the Constitutional Court, reminiscent of Jesus Christ chasing a gang of gamblers from the Holy Temple which they were defiling. This columnist watched the corrupt and wretched of the Judiciary flee away from the premises of the temple of constitutional justice as if they had seen the revenging angel of the Lord. No one has flushed them. Out for punishment some years ago, a sister temple, the High Court of Uganda, had been vandalised by soldiers apparently with the knowledge and encouragement of members of the Executive and its untrained brutal forces. Rape of the temple of justice The then Principal Judge James Ogoola condemned the event as tantamount to the rape of the temple of justice. However, he now appears to have joined the harem of judicial eunuchs. Justice Ogoola has deliberately chosen not to say anything or corroborate with those who are hunting down the scourge of judicial corruption and abuse of office. On the other hand, privately he and all the other members of the Judicial Service Commission, including the elected representatives of the Uganda Law Council, admit that some of the recent decisions, comments and appointments in Cabinet and the Judiciary are unconstitutional, dishonest and unlawful. Ugandans then ask the whole establishment of the legal fraternity those questions; ""why have you failed us or did you eat the forbidden fruit?""

It is not only a tone of quickly delivering on justice through expeditious trails - but importantly, confronting corruption in the Judiciary and by extension the country. This enthusiasm of Chief Justice must be supported, encouraged and not extinguished.  The country is optimistic and looking forward to action. Yet I strongly believe, that to strengthen this new energy manifested in Chief Justice, the discourse on how to fully confront and defeat corruption must go beyond a forest of laws and plethora of anti- corruption institutions, often grandstanding in parliamentary oversight committees, political sound bites and playing to the gallery - to concrete actions that balance laws and morals in this country. Recently, Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta remarked that ""corruption is the greatest threat to our security, fundamental rights and social-economic transformation"" His nerve remark is not only true for Kenya- but for Uganda, and perhaps the entire world. Instead of reaching out to each other as a citizenry, we are stealing from each other. The battle against corruption is frustrating and sometimes sucks energy, but we shouldn't give up. Citizen action is critical. Beyond political actors; Where is Black Monday? Where are our religious and cultural leaders? Where are our teachers, trade unionists, community organisers, traditional healers, Facebookers, tweeps, farmers, brethren, wives and husbands? Folks, it's now clear an iron curtain of corruption has descended across our nation.  Most sectors of everyday life are affected- be it churches, mosques, homes, universities, schools, sports clubs, government offices, private offices, gardens, etc. For example, farmers are reportedly conniving with extension workers to inflate input prices, some local councils and community leaders are taking bribes to make unfair decisions in village courts, police constables are reported receiving 'facilitation' to intervene on behalf of cunning village landed gentry to cheat peasants, teachers  are  riding boda bodas  for quick buck and receiving salaries (from tax payers) while our children are receiving no lessons, milk vendors are powering water in milk to cheat consumers, traders are tampering with weighing scales and cheating farmers, politicians are buying votes, voters are selling their votes, business men are cheating government taxes, etc - this trend may not be  in the headlines -but it is  sadly entrenched. Will a compendium of anti-corruption laws and legislations alone stop this anarchy?  As a country- we need a renewal and a return to our core ancestral values that define us a people that lived by code of respect, fairness, community and honesty. All leaders and parents of this country must engage in preaching and stop pointing fingers- because, givers and receivers of bribes are in summary all criminals. I hope this will not be dismissed by sceptics and law puritans as moralising the fight against corruption. It is also not a lamentation - but call to action. My hunch tells me we have focused more on putting in place hardware administrative, legislative and judicial systems while relegating software incentives that entrench powerful value systems and social sanctions in our country.  The NRM government has worked to strengthen investigative organs that deal with corruption. For example, the government reformed the office of the Auditor General (AG) and Director of Public prosecutions (DPP) from mere departments to substantive and independent institutions.  The Parliamentary Accounts Committee (PAC) has powers of high court and is visibly interrogative and very much on the scene in the corruption fight. The anti- corruption court is in place. These institutions have sometimes delivered - and most corruption scandals are exposed by the Auditor General's office- a government institution. But citizens want more than mere discovery and exposure of corruption scandals to actions that deliver justice and build competent systems that make corruption untenable and dangerously risky. Efforts at eliminating payroll corruption are yielding positive results. Administrative sanctions issued by Ministry of Finance permanent secretary Keith Muhakanizi were at first painful to genuine public workers but have since saved billions of tax payers' money. But how do we holistically defeat corruption? A sustainable solution to corruption lies in return to a robust struggle for revival and entrenchment of values of community and citizenship. Especially so with young people in our schools, clubs and everywhere. They need to learn that the world must be shared and every one must have an opportunity. That to own 20 houses you can't sleep in at once and four cars you can't drive at once is meaningless and backward.  Parents must live by example- we must for instance go to our children's schools and request to speak to children classes about the subject of values like morality and community. If we don't live by example and preach our historic values- society is gone! Not even the fiercest of laws and prison sentences will avert this dangerous trend. Does this sound simplistic?  No. It's the only credible journey we must start. Nelson Mandela, in his latest 2011 book - Conversations with My Self; tells a compelling story about real progress. He counsels that "".... In judging our progress as individuals, we tend concentrate on external factors such as one's social position, influence and popularity, wealth and standard of education. These are of course important in measuring one's success in material matters and it is perfectly understandable if many people exert themselves mainly to achieve all these. But internal factors may be even more crucial in assessing ones development as a human being. Honesty, sincerity, simplicity, humility, pure generosity, absence of vanity, readiness to serve others - qualities which are within reach of every soul - are the foundations of one's spiritual life. Development in matters of this nature is inconceivable without serious introspection, without knowing yourself, your weaknesses and mistakes....never forget that a saint is a sinner who keeps on trying"" The foregoing gospel according to Mandela is important. Interpreted seriously, it summons our courage as a country to engage in serious introspection. He reminds us that those internal factors like honesty and readiness to serve others are the most important and within our reach. Aren't those we need to overcome corruption?  Can we defeat the reigning dominant psychology that is bent on material factors that Mandela talks about?  Can we rally to the principle of common citizenship that Winston Churchill talked about on March 5, 1946?

He said internal investigations exposed the scam, leading to the dismissal of at least 18 inspectors. Mr Pedzapasi was giving oral evidence before a Parliamentary portfolio committee on Transport and Infrastructural Department chaired by Epworth Member of National Assembly Cde Amos Midzi (Zanu-PF).

""We are not getting a single call. What is disappointing is that our law enforcement agencies are letting us down because these things were happening right under their nose (in Chiredzi) but they did not do anything.

Glen Norah MP Mr Webster Maondera (MDC-T) asked why buses and other vehicles were allowed to ferry people on national roads defectiveness.

In light of the publication of a shocking salary schedule by some sections of the media, and public outrage over the same; no matter what the Urban Councils Act says, it was not judicious for Minister Chombo to be seen to be trying to protect the town clerk from public scrutiny. All that Dr Mahachi needed to do was avail the salary schedule and prove to residents and ratepayers that their money was not being consumed at the expense of service delivery. The general mood in the country is one of total aversion to all forms of corruption as the nation walks in step with President Mugabe's call for zero tolerance to all forms of graft. And how the Zanu-PF Government deals with what is coming out of state enterprises will go a long way towards not only the successful implementation of Zim-Asset but also the party's fortunes in 2018. In its winning election manifesto, Zanu-PF identified corruption as a major threat to achieving the goals of the people, namely putting the economy in the hands of indigenous Zimbabweans and getting it to work for the people. This is why even the economic blueprint, the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation that was synthesised from the manifesto, President Mugabe's inauguration address as well as his speech during a luncheon that was hosted by the Local Government, Public Works and National Housing Ministry on the occasion of the official opening of the First Session of the Eighth Parliament last year, all advocate zero tolerance to corruption. In fact Chapter Five of the manifesto that covers 'Threats to Winning the Goals of the People' singles out corruption in local authorities as a major cancer. ""Of particular concern is the rampant corruption in local authorities which interface directly with the people on a daily basis in terms of the delivery of key public services. The victims of corruption whether in the public or private sector; the professional, NGO or religious sectors are always the people. This is why zero-tolerance of corruption has become a national priority,"" reads the Zanu-PF manifesto. As such while his intentions may have been noble, Dr Chombo's reinstatement of Dr Mahachi without the publication of the city's salary schedule naturally appeared to be an attempt to keep the lid on goings on at Town House. The situation was further compounded by the general perception that Dr Chombo, as minister responsible for local authorities, was meddling in personnel issues when his brief as minister relates to guiding policy, and as such had something to hide. We thus call on the Minister to urge the powers that be at Town House to clear the air with residents who religiously pay their dues on the back of deteriorating service delivery. They need to know what their money is being used for. The fight against corruption requires everyone's support."512,The Herald (Harare),2/5/14,MPs Hail President's Stance On Corruption,,ZIMBABWE (95%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,10-Feb-14,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (79%)",418 words,CORRUPTION (92%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (91%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); ECONOMIC STIMULUS (89%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (79%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (78%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (76%); EMERGING MARKETS (75%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (73%); MISAPPROPRIATION (70%); CITIES (55%); CITY GOVERNMENT (55%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (50%) Zimbabwe; Corruption,"GOVERNMENT must remove corrupt leadership at state enterprises and parastatals if economic revival and growth are to be achieved, parliamentarians said yesterday. They made the remarks in the National Assembly while debating President Mugabe' speech when he officially opened the First Session of the Eight Parliament. The legislators threw their weight behind President Mugabe's call that Government would exercise zero-tolerance on corruption. The legislators' comments follow reports that top management at Premier Services Medical Aid Society, Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation, Air Zimbabwe, Marange Resources and Harare City Council might have fleeced the nation of millions of dollars through salaries, allowances and misappropriation of public funds. The MP for Mazowe North, Engineer Edgar Chidavaenzi (Zanu-PF), said corruption was a threat to investment and economic growth. ""I totally support the President's call for zero tolerance to corruption in all its forms and norms. I implore this House to demand thorough investigations into operations of parastatals, Government-affiliated and Government-supported institutions so as to root-out all malpractices and policies that contribute to their perennial failures and put in place new strategies, policies and framework that are development friendly. ""We hail Government for taking stern measures against corrupt people especially in parastatals. These people have been doing these things on their own yet at the same time tarnishing the image of the ruling party and Government,"" said Eng Chidavaenzi. Several legislators and other stakeholders have already called on the State to prosecute all those involved in misapprorpiation of public funds. Midlands legislator Cde Melody Dziva (Zanu-PF) said it was important for Government to focus on economic revival to address challenges that faced the country while Gokwe-Kabuyuni legislator, Cde Leonard Chikomba (Zanu-PF) also hailed President Mugabe for his stance on zero-tolerance to corruption. ""The President spoke of transparency (when he officially opened Parliament). Corruption makes our country less attractive to investors,"" said Cde Dziva. She then called for the removal of illegal sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe saying the embargo was a violation of human rights, a position backed by Mashonaland West MP Cde Nomsa Mhlanga (Zanu-PF). Buhera North MP Cde William Mutomba (Zanu-PF) said it was important for Government to focus on busting the illegal sanctions instead of complaining about the embargo."513,The Herald (Harare),2/6/14,Corruption: Ball in Government's Court [editorial],,ZIMBABWE (94%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,10-Feb-14,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (78%)",641 words,CORRUPTION (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (89%); CITY GOVERNMENT (89%); MAYORS (86%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (75%); BANKING & FINANCE (72%); EMBARGOES & SANCTIONS (67%); WAGES & SALARIES (60%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Governance,"Every nation faces multifarious problems on a daily basis, and at this moment in history Zimbabwe faces a twin that has captured public attention like no other in recent times.The first is corruption in both the public and the private sectors. In as much as anger is justifiably targeted at abuses that border on -- and in several cases are outright -- criminality in public-funded enterprises, much of the graft cannot occur without private sector compliance and/or instigation. Yes, a lot of the corruption we see involves either State officials or people that the state has tasked to run particular businesses and provide essential services. But at the same time, the private sector is deeply involved in this; either through our murky tender system, our near-enclave banking sector and a network of middlemen who promise heaven on earth at the most ridiculously high prices. Public sector corruption is indeed a major thorn in the flesh, more so in an environment such as ours where economic sanctions are inflicting their own harm, but this scourge cannot be dealt with without concurrently confronting graft in the private sector. And this brings us to the second aspect of the twin challenge that has preoccupied our nation in recent weeks: that of how we practically deal with corruption. It is one thing to expose corruption, and quite another to bring to book perpetrators. As already indicated, there is much anger that has been brewed by the revelations of looting of public funds. This anger stems from not just the fact that money has been pilfered, but also that there seems to be little action from authorities to deal with the characters named thus far. The anger is further fed by a perception in some quarters that perhaps Government officials are not serious about rooting out corruption, despite President Mugabe's firm declaration of zero tolerance for the vice. This was exacerbated by a recent directive by Local Government Minister Dr Ignatius Chombo to reinstate suspended Harare town clerk Dr Tendai Mahachi, who Mayor Bernard Manyenyeni had put on ice for three months for failing to reveal what kind of salaries are being paid to managers at council. And that Mayor Manyenyeni wrote a reinstatement letter to Dr Mahachi, despite claiming in public that he does not know why the town clerk is reporting for duty, will only further fuel anger among people who think that the State machinery is not serious about stamping out abuse of public offices and funds. The authorities will tell us that they cannot rush to prosecute people on the basis of newspaper reports. That is correct and we support it fully. Our issue though would be this: are the arms of Government seriously telling the nation that they were not aware of what has been going on and that they are hearing it for the first time in the media? Surely, someone somewhere knew of these shenanigans and has ample evidence to secure dismissals and prosecutions wherever appropriate. In the concerned companies, at their parent ministries, in police offices, in Anti-Corruption Commission safes, and at Chaminuka Building, surely among all these there is sufficient documentation to have action taken much quicker. Government cannot be waiting for the media to expose corruption; Government must be telling the media how it is dealing with corruption. Beyond those cases that have been reported on, there are many people in Government and at parastatals who have information on other incidences and patterns of graft and abuse and these should be acted on without first having to wait for media exposure. It should be made clear to the corrupt that they are better off resigning now rather than waiting for media exposure and subsequent public trials. Because they certainly shall be exposed, and the public shall demand justice. What we ask Government now is: what is it doing?"514,The Herald (Harare),2/12/14,Zanu-PF Will Not Tolerate Corruption,,ZIMBABWE (92%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,12-Feb-14,,548 words,CORRUPTION (91%); STRATEGIC PLANNING (90%); POLITICS (78%); PLATFORMS & ISSUES (77%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (76%); CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (56%) Zimbabwe; Corruption,"Vice President Joice Mujuru has denied that she is against media revelations on corrupt activities. She said this while officially opening the Mashonaland Central provincial planning workshop in Mazowe aimed at aligning the provincial strategic plan to Zim-Asset.The Vice President accused the media of twisting facts to suit their agenda, saying Government was working on a corporate governance framework to curb corruption in both the public and private sectors. VP Mujuru said the fight against corruption was critical for the successful implementation of the Zim-Asset economic blueprint, adding that people caught on the wrong side of the law in central Government, public enterprises and local authorities would be held accountable. Addressing a Zanu-PF Women's League conference in Chinhoyi at the weekend, VP Mujuru warned the party to be wary of individuals who have infiltrated the party with the aim of distabilising it from within, saying they could use the anti-graft drive to this end. ZANU-PF says it wants a framework to deal with corruption that has been exposed by the media since the beginning of the year. In a statement yesterday, Zanu-PF spokesperson Cde Rugare Gumbo commended the media's role in exposing instances of graft. ""In the same vein the party believes that complex and intricate issues like corruption staring at our faces cannot be resolved in a piece-meal, haphazard and simplistic manner. ""The party needs a comprehensive plan and policy to deal with this menace. Everything must be done above board in an orderly, organised and systematic way to prevent possible accusation of a cover-up,"" Cde Gumbo said. He condemned looting of public resources and called for decisive action against perpetrators. ""We would also like to thank the media, both public and private, for their concerted efforts in bringing this shameful situation to public light. ""For our part, and for the avoidance of any doubt, we wish to make it known that we will take decisive measures to eradicate corruption in all its forms. ""Those involved in corrupt activities must and will face the full wrath of the law and we are determined to make this a reality. We wish, in the circumstances, to urge all Government ministries to continue to act in the spirit of Zim-Asset, and in the national interest, by carrying out extensive audits in their respective ministries as we believe it will lead to public accountability and instil confidence in the use of public funds,"" he said. The Zanu-PF spokesperson said the revolutionary party had a zero-tolerance to corruption, a policy clearly pronounced by President Robert Mugabe, Vice President Joice Mujuru and national chairman Cde Simon Khaya Moyo. ""This explains why for us corruption was an election issue and why, like the other issues that really matter to us, it was at the very heart of our election manifesto. ""It is also important to understand that the Zanu-PF conference in Chinhoyi came up with a raft of resolutions chief amongst which was the need to adopt a zero-tolerance approach to corruption. ""That resolution has since found expression in Zim-Asset and, along with every other issue in that blueprint, is currently being spearheaded by the Office of the President and Cabinet. We believe that this is as it should be,"" Cde Gumbo said."517,The Herald (Harare),2/20/14,President Warns Against Corruption,,ZIMBABWE (96%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%),Newspaper,Tendai Mugabe,ENGLISH,21-Feb-14,,968 words,CORRUPTION (91%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); INTERVIEWS (90%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (79%); ANNUAL REPORTS (75%); RELIGION (60%) Zimbabwe; Corruption,"President Mugabe has said anyone found to be involved in corruption and criminal abuse of office will be jailed. The President blamed some Government ministers for either being part of ""salarygate"", or failing to properly supervise entities falling under their briefs. Click on the video below to watch the interview The Head of State and Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces said this in an interview to mark his 90th birthday that was aired on ZBCTV Thursday night. Dr Dube was reportedly taking home nearly US$6 million a year in salaries and allowances, while the medical aid society was reeling under a huge debt. ""What does vaCuthbert Dube tell us, (he says) ko chitadzo chandakaita ndechipi?"" said President Mugabe. ""Punishment of those who are proved to have been corrupt, to have been stealing - we lock them up. Vambononzwawo jeri kuti rinorwadza sei."" President Mugabe said line ministers did little to help the situation because they were yes-men and out of touch with realities on the ground. ""Line ministry or the minister was a yes minister - standoffish,"" he said. ""Minister haiwa tinokuitirai basa, do not mind. The permanent secretary stands in between. ""The minister and the rest of the department yeGovernment, the minister and the boards you got to have the permanent secretary, then the chairman of the board who comes to report hee, yaa zvinhu zviri kufamba zvakanaka and so on and you rely on that. ""The board itself does not carry out examinations, inspection of what is being done by the parastatal if it is a parastatal and the minister is far removed when it comes to parastatals and that is where most of the corruption occurred. And you can see that these are institutions which were far removed from direct control by the Government - creations of the British we inherited."" President Mugabe said parastatal bosses exploited poor supervision to loot. ""If there are losses they rely on Government to come with subventions and reports, yes, there will be reports from parastatals, the system we had inherited from Britain - annual reports, but loss after loss. Why? If there is profit - minimal. ""What is happening? Because there was no close supervision, morons took advantage of the system and wanted to benefit themselves and enrich themselves."" Corruption, President Mugabe said, was rampant and had even permeated social institutions such as churches. ""So, there it is. It is corruption everywhere even kumachurch kwese,"" he said. ""Ndange ndichiverenga chimwe chipepa change chichiti kuUnited States, is it kuuniversity, kwanzi people can attend, is it the church, in nudity, being nude, naked? ""Just imagine what it means. Zvinorevei izvozvo? Hamuna mabhurukwa zvese. Munonamata Mwari upi, haiwaiwa? And if you just take pictures moenda nawo you are not hiding anything, you are showing everything."" President Mugabe, however, expressed confidence in his new Cabinet. He said he wanted the Zanu-PF Government to deliver and ensure that civil servants got decent salaries. In this regard, the President said he told Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa to pull up his socks when he appeared to be dragging his feet on awarding civil servants salaries in line with the poverty datum line. ""I have said our Government must not repeat the ills of the Government of National Unity of yesterday, therefore, it must not even have the shadow of it,"" he said. ""It must work as a Government that is in control of full resources - that takes into account the fact of the hardships the people have gone through all along, the loss they suffered through hyperinflation and the difficulties imposed not just by sanctions, but even by the traumatic conditions by the drought and so on and so we must have normal salaries. ""Yes, we cannot have them from day one, but we must have them on paper for a start and work towards their being fulfilled in practice and that is what Chinamasa is doing. ""First, he was saying we could not do it and I said well, if you cannot do it then tell me we can get someone who can do it. That is why I announced that salaries have got to be slightly above poverty datum line... ""You know, let us think about their situations also.

""I am glad they have gone some three-quarters way in meeting the poverty datum line requirement and I hope by June they will have come there, but that is alright and our workers are understanding."" Although he pointed out that it was not necessary to have demonstrations and strikes, President Mugabe said it would be illogical and irresponsible for Government to use the police to stop civil servants from going into the streets demanding salary increments. ""We do not also want unnecessary demonstrations and strikes,"" he said. ""When they are well based with grievances that genuine, well, do we have to say totuma mapurisa to quell them when they have genuine grievances? You cannot do that.

He was sentenced to 18 months in prison, with six months suspended on condition that he does not commit a similar offence in the next five years. Mr Chitumwa said corruption was a scourge that needed decisive action to be stopped. He said Jecheche's moral blameworthiness was high and his actions were fuelled by greed rather than need. Prosecutor Mr Vote Zishiri proved beyond reasonable doubt that Jecheche solicited for a bribe. He was arrested soon after receiving US$6 000 in marked notes from a land seeker. He had the money in his office desk when police pounced on him. It was proved that Jecheche was approached by a land seeker Mr Honest Mushangwe in September, 2013 who wanted a plot at Hunyani Estates in Chegutu. Jecheche told him there had been three vacant plots but two had been taken up. After viewing the plot, he was told that he should pay US$6 000 which was to be shared between Jecheche and other officials. He was told to pay another US$3 000 to Jecheche for facilitating the allocation. However, Mr Mushangwe, from Harare, said he only had US$1 400 and the DA told him to come back with the full payment. Mr Mushangwe made a police report and officers set a trap. Marked bills were placed in an A4 envelope and Jecheche told Mr Mushangwe to place the money in his Nissan Elgrand, which was parked outside his office. Mr Mushangwe said there were people near the car, and Jecheche told him to put the envelope in the top left drawer of his office desk.

Church leaders convened a prayer service and discussion session on February 28 under the theme: ""Church leaders against corruption"". The conveners were the Zimbabwe Faith, Ethics and Development (Zifepa). In attendance were representatives from the Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe Catholics Bishops Conference, Baptist Union of Zimbabwe, Indigenous Pastors Fellowship of Zimbabwe and the Affirmative Action Group. This was an open admission that corruption was not a preserve of the public sector and its various parastatals; the conveners wanted to drive home a point: corruption is also a cancer eating away the church. This no holds barred discussion set to seek answers and from the highlights of the presentations, there is need for the nation to adopt a no-nonsense approach in order to stamp out the scourge and move forward. Bishop Noah Pashapa of Life and Liberty Churches International and Zifepa executive chairman said, ""The objectives were to sensitise and mobilise the church leaders towards fighting corruption within the church; to share information, education and awareness towards empowering church leaders to more effectively to enlighten their parishioners some of whom are captains of industry and influential politicians on the wrongs of corruption and ways to fight it; to affirm and celebrate President Mugabe's principled stand against corruption and those media houses and government ministers who have actively and openly used their influence to fight corruption; to pray for those like president Mugabe, ministers Jonathan Moyo and Supa Mandiwanzira and media journalists that have been outspoken against corruption to be protected by God because corruption is often sponsored by mafia style cartels made up of evil members of the rich and ruling classes especially where business, political and demonic interests meet as with Cecil John Rhodes, the British Government and Satanism"". The main speakers were Father Fraderic Chiromba (Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops Conference); Apostle Alex Chisango (Revival Church Ministries); and Dr Davison Gomo (CEO, AAG). Panelists were Rev Dr Roy Musasiwa (Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe); Bishop Munyaradzi Pundo (Indigenous Pastors Fellowship of Zimbabwe), Father Fraderic Chiromba (ZCBC) and Rev Tich Dzinotyiwei (Baptist Union of Zimbabwe). Father Chiromba's presentation premised on the ""Pastoral Letter from the Catholic Bishops of Southern Africa"" highlighted that: ""Statistics highlight the very serious problem we have regarding corruption in many areas of Southern Africa. It has been reported that almost half of the citizens in our countries of Southern Africa admit to having paid a bribe, mostly to police officers and government officials. This means that the challenge to work for the eradication of this illness is addressed to all of us. Each must do something within their power to tackle corruption"". He added, ""Corruption hurts the most vulnerable. Corruption harms the whole community. Corruption is theft from the poor. Corruption destroys our trust. The experience of corruption leads us to become cynical about each other, to distrust the very people we regard as our leaders and as honourable people."" Apostle Chisango said Christians from all denominations should castigate all forms of corruption. ""President Mugabe is a devout Christian and we have a good starting point on the fight against corruption. If the mega salaries many are currently earning are toned down, that money can be used to create millions of jobs for the unemployed."" He added: ""There has been a tendency by the wealthy to manipulate and override political processes and dispossess the poor who do not have power. There are people infiltrating politics to manipulate the legislation to their advantage."" Dr Gomo maintained that ""If one cares to listen to the stories that the public talks about, the only conclusion you arrive at is that there is decay in all our institutions. The big question is, how prepared are we to tackle this problem head on? Is there political and public will to confront this menace and deal with it ruthlessly? If this is left to fester on and deepen its grip on our society leading to its socialisation and institutionalisation, the cost of correcting and repairing the damage is just too ghastly to contemplate. ""It is important that we look at the Christian world view and of course the position of Christians to the question of corruption. Today in Zimbabwe, a lot of churches are led by business people and professionals in Government, parastatals and the private sector. What is even more interesting and must be analysed carefully is the relationship between the corporate leaders who are part of the modern church and in some cases, these individuals on the churches and where they do not own the church, they happen to occupy influential positions in the church. ""Instead of talking about curbing corruption, my view is that the church should be talking about zero tolerance and the complete removal of corruption in our midst. The church's position must not be one based on isolated attempts at conferencing about this inimical and social evil. Instead, the church must bring out its moral amour and deploy it to leave no space for such practices in their spheres of activity and in society in general,"" he said. ""Why for instance should business leaders and professionals who have been implicated in dubious business dealings be allowed to continue in positions of influence in church? Should the church be accepting donations from people whose character is inconsistent with the fundamental moral position of the church? Should the church be exalting materialism and even more controversially, should leaders of the church be living lives that are contrary to the simple lifestyle that Jesus portrayed during his mission on earth?"" Facts argue, but truth remains as is. What has the church done to stamp out corruption? Dr Gomo called for ""minimum rules of reporting and disclosure in order to maintain and safeguard integrity in financial reporting and strategic decision making."" Dr Musasiwa said the EFZ's press statement of February 14, ""A Call to Moral and Spiritual Accountability"" was the guiding principle. He also said there is need for introspection: ""Agreed, corruption is a scourge that should be eradicated. I ask what happened to the moral values instilled by the Chimurenga song ""Nzira Dzamasoja"" sung during the liberation struggle, which made it very clear that we don't take things from the poor and, we compensate what we would have taken; we pay for everything we have purchased. All these values were articulated in political songs."" Rev Dzinotyiwei said a system of church governance should be put in place to ensure that church leaders are accountable to their congregation always. Bishop Pundo argued that the church should follow what the word of God says. ""The church is the salt that seasons and preserves Christian and ethical conduct in the church and society at large. When corruption becomes a scourge, the finger should be pointed toward us, the church leadership, that we have failed to preserve moral and ethical conduct. We have failed to season those in the public and private sectors. We should educate each other as church leaders and tell ourselves that we walk in righteously."" He also touched on a controversial element: the church and politics and said, ""The problem is that a lot of church leaders claim to be apolitical, but in our case, we said let's join hands with indigenous churches because they are not apolitical. Politics is now fraught with corruption because the salt is missing. We realised that even in the Bible the priest, the King and the prophet worked together. So we encourage the church to do likewise."" Dr Gomo's concluding remarks are a challenge to all: ""Whatever it is we do, it is important to understand and appreciate that corruption is a serious problem affecting our democracy and the economy and engenders grave consequences for the security of the economy, society and persons""."526,The Herald (Harare),3/7/14,Tomana Raps Corruption,,ZIMBABWE (93%),Newspaper,Simbarashe Mudzivo,ENGLISH,7-Mar-14,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (88%)",272 words,CORRUPTION (90%); BRIBERY (90%); RISK MANAGEMENT (90%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (90%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (76%); EXECUTIVES (72%); CRIME PREVENTION (66%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Prosecutor-General Mr Johannes Tomana has said many prosecutions do not end in convictions because of rampant corruption in the judicial system.

We would want the board of enquiry constituted as a matter of agency to investigate allegations flying around about operations of the hospital so that the administration is put at ease, he said. Dr Parirenyatwa said there were numerous anonymous letters coming from members of staff alleging irregularities in operations at the hospital. Medical superintendent Dr Collett Mawire told Dr Parirenyatwa, who was accompanied by his deputy Dr Paul Chimedza and Provincial Affairs Minister for Mashonaland West Faber Chidarikire, about alleged sinister plots and the anonymous letters. Management has found it difficult to control some members of staff purportedly due to their supposed affiliations and untouchable nature, he said. Dr Mawire said one State certified nurse unilaterally changed his uniform to that of a registered general nurse before threatening the executive with unspecified action. The same member of staff has since traded his epaulettes for military badges, he further alleged. A radiographer allegedly refused to do scans on patients before turning the matter into a political issue. Dr Parirenyatwa said until the board finalised its investigations and came up with recommendations, Dr Mawire's administration remained in charge.

The blueprint was adopted by Government last year after Zanu PF's victory in the harmonised elections and will run until 2018. VP Mujuru was officiating at the two-day Zim Asset awareness seminar for parliamentarians in Harare. ""Zim Asset will succeed when we observe dignity at home and at corporate levels. Hunhu hunokosha. We should all shun corruption in all its forms. Government is unanimous in its resolve to eradicate this scourge, and I wish to urge legislators to support this effort. We may differ in the implementation but the objectives are the same,"" she said. ""The thrust of the economic blueprint is to open up business opportunities in all sectors of the economy. As such it becomes our responsibility, as stakeholders, to ensure that we have a conducive legal framework that facilitates ease of doing business. This necessitates collaborative effort in eliminating structural and other barriers to business."" Government has embarked on processes to rid public enterprises of corruption following publication of ""obscene"" salaries and flouting of tender procedures in most parastatals. She added that it was important that parliament played its oversight role over the executive. ""In pursuance of Zim Asset objectives, the legislative, representational, public debate and oversight roles of parliament become quite critical. As parliamentarians your oversight role in ensuring that Government policies, programmes and projects are successfully implemented to realise economic growth, development and prosperity for all Zimbabweans remains paramount. ""To that end allow me to say the quality of work coming from our two chambers is quite commendable. If we maintain that momentum, then real progress is guaranteed,"" VP Mujuru said. She said President Mugabe had, during the opening of the First Session of the Eighth Parliament outlined Bills that would be brought to parliament and would positively change the business environment in the country. She said one such Bill was the Tripartite Negotiating Forum Bill that would facilitate negotiations between Government, business and labour. ""Your support in ratifying the various pieces of legislation that will be presented before you during the implementation period of the Plan cannot be overemphasised. Together we can build Zimbabwe into a prosperous nation,"" VP Mujuru said. The Vice President added that it was also important for parliament to facilitate adoption of laws that promoted the growth of the information and communication technology sector as it had a possibility of providing employment opportunities to young people. ""In the same breadth, sufficient and urgent attention needs to be given to the banking and financial services sector in order to address the liquidity challenges being faced by industry whilst seeking to mobilise funding for programmes and projects under Zim Asset. ""The successful implementation of Zim Asset will require us to work together, pursuing win-win partnerships and joint ventures which recognise and place an appropriate value and weight on the aspirations of our people,"" VP Mujuru said. Zim Asset is divided into four clusters that include Food Security and Nutrition, Social Services and Poverty Reduction, Infrastructure and Utilities and Value Addition and Beneficiation. ""The cluster approach will facilitate easier prioritisation of Government programmes and projects up to 2018. Further, it will eliminate the solo mentality and over compartmentalisation while engendering effective coordination, monitoring and evaluation as well as efficient allocation of resources,"" she said The workshops objectives include the creation awareness of Zim Asset among legislators, enable them to appreciate their role in providing legislative framework for the blueprint and to create a five year university programme from certificate up to post doctoral levels as a practical way of implementing the programme."532,The Herald (Harare),3/19/14,Traffic Cops' Corruption - Fifth Suspect in the Dock,,ZIMBABWE (93%),Newspaper,Fungai Lupande,ENGLISH,19-Mar-14,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (93%)",273 words,BRIBERY (90%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (90%); VEHICLE TRAFFIC (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); VEHICLE LICENSING & REGISTRATION (89%); TRANSPORTATION LAW (89%); EXTORTION (77%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"A fifth suspect believed to be part of a gang allegedly used by rogue traffic police officers in Harare to collect bribes from commuter omnibus crews has appeared in court charged with extortion. Gift Chiwambutsa (30) of Munyuki in Epworth appeared before Harare magistrate Mr Tendai Mahwe last Thursday. Pardon Chikowe (26), Simbarashe Siringwani (34), Robson Sandinga (37) and Byron Konde (26) appeared in court on similar charges a day earlier. It is alleged that the police officers would liaise with commuter omnibus rank marshals to collect cash from kombi crews before feeding the registration numbers of compliant drivers onto phones of police officers at roadblocks. Those who had paid between US$4 and US$12 daily would then have easy passage at police controlled roadblocks, it is alleged. Prosecutor Ms Sharon Mashavira alleged that between March 10 and 11 at Overspill bus terminus, Chiwambutsa, also known as ""Keda"" in that area, collected US$5 each from 36 commuter omnibus drivers plying Mbare-Epworth route. It is alleged that Chiwambutsa surrendered US$180 and the list of vehicle registration numbers to police officers which they would use to allow the vehicles to pass. On March 12, 2013 at around 7.45am, Chiwambutsa allegedly collected US$190 from 37 commuter omnibuses plying the same route and made a list of their license plate numbers on a paper. A police informant exposed the alleged scam leading to Chiwambutsa's arrest. Police officers found US$190 and the list of 37 vehicle registration numbers on him. On interrogation, Chiwambutsa allegedly admitted to sending the list to a number said to belong to a police officer."534,The Herald (Harare),3/24/14,Greed Drives Corruption,,ZIMBABWE (94%),Newspaper,Tendayi Nyahuye,ENGLISH,24-Mar-14,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (92%)",326 words,BANKING & FINANCE (91%); CONSUMER LAW (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); LEGISLATION (90%); MOBILE COMMERCE (90%); CONSUMER PROTECTION (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (79%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); CONSUMER WATCHDOGS (78%); TAXES & TAXATION (70%) Zimbabwe; Corruption,"Corruption has far-reaching implications on society and creates disproportionate costs on consumers, a senior Government official has said.

""Public corruption has taken a bigger slice of the attention with private sector corruption following behind,"" she said. ""Both forms are driven by greed that has gone out of control and both are a major assault on consumer rights. ""Consumers are made to pay for services at tariffs beyond cost and reasonable margin. Worse still, consumers are often made to pay for services and then are denied those services."" Ms Mabuwa urged businesses to shun corruption to help protect consumers from distorted pricing. She said her ministry was still consulting stakeholders on how best to improve the draft Consumer Rights Bill. Ms Mabuwa called on stakeholders in the mobile banking and financial services sector to bring proposals that improve the draft Bill. ""The Bill does not as yet address mobile financial services specifically. My ministry will, therefore, need to be guided by colleagues who are involved in mobile banking and financial services in order to improve the existing draft Bill. This will be with a view to incorporate consumer concerns on the matter. ""I can assure you it is no longer business as usual. A draft of the Bill is already in place and is being examined by the relevant authorities before it can be tabled in Parliament.

Mr Tomana, who is also the acting Attorney-General, said this during a briefing with the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs on the functions and status of the National Prosecuting Authority. ""Until Government is able to get on top of corruption, we are not going anywhere,"" he said. ""We are seven months (since the First Session of the Eighth Parliament was officially opened by President Mugabe) down the line and those institutions as you know are either non-existent or incapacitated both on the legal framework and resource aspect of it."" Mr Tomana said the NPA was still to be fully functional as it had no staff complement of its own while the enabling legislative framework had not yet been put in place. ""We have not been able to operate at an optimum. We don't have adequate human resources and at that level you expect adequate budgetary support. ""As we speak it is the most unsupported institution with a very heavy load on its shoulders,"" he said. The NPA was created as an independent prosecuting authority whose functions were separated from the AG's office. Commissioners to the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission are also yet to be appointed since the lapse of the tenure of the previous commission. Zimbabwe is battling corruption following exposure of a number of corruption cases and abuse of resources in parastatals and local authorities. Mr Tomana reiterated that his support for Zanu-PF was his constitutional right but called for people to judge him on professional conduct not his political preferences. ""All Zimbabweans enjoy the constitutional right to have a political mind and a constitutional right to vote for a party of their choice and it's all up to an individual to make it public,"" he said. ""I understand the independence of this institution that what it bids the incumbent is to be professional and unbiased. We are supposed to prosecute without fear, without favour, without bias and without prejudice. ""When I am given a docket I should not be afraid of nobody. I should not be encouraged directly or indirectly. ""The only thing I must consider is whether or not with the facts and with the law before me a crime was committed,"" Mr Tomana said. He said the independence required of him at the NPA did not mean he could not join a political party or club of his choice. ""The independence doesn't preclude me from associating with any political party that persuades me when I am a registered voter. ""The only consideration is whether I am qualified as a lawyer,"" he said. ""I know that the independence I am supposed to exercise is professional independence. ""Professional independence has nothing to do with which club I go to or which church I go to.

In his statement to mark Zimbabwe's 34th Independence anniversary, the Chimurenga legend said corruption was betrayal of the values of the liberation struggle and national independence. ""Our nation must develop, but the worrying thing facing our country today is corruption, instead of working to develop our country there are those selfish individuals who because of their positions of influence are busy stealing from the poor. ""That must stop; it's a betrayal of the values of the liberation struggle and our national independence. Independence is not about corruption, it is not about party politics, it is about honesty, unity of purpose and the love for Zimbabwe not parties or politicians,"" he said. The United States-based musician who announced that he will be coming home in September, said he has since recorded a song to be featured on is upcoming album in which he implores politicians to put the country and its people first. ""I have composed a song which says -- ""Vanhuvaneta Nepolitics"" which will be on my forthcoming album ""Dangerzone"", advising the politicians of our country to stop politicking because the citizens are tired of political games. Our people are suffering; they need food on their tables, education, and above all a good life. We must share the national cake equally. ""The values of the liberation struggle go beyond party politics and individualism. Those who are corrupt must be held accountable. We have a task as Zimbabweans to fight corruption. It is tearing our economy apart. In the 1980s I sang about corruption. ""The traits are still manifesting in some comrades even today,"" he said. He also paid tribute to the gallant sons and daughters of the soil who went to war during the liberation struggle. ""As we mark our Independence, I take this opportunity to honour and salute the brave heroes and heroines of this land who sacrificed their lives, families, careers, and education to join the war of liberation. ""It is such sacrifices that brought about the freedom we are enjoying today. I also wish to extend my special gratitude to the following countries that assisted us during the war -- Mozambique, Zambia, Tanzania, Russia to mention but a few. It was their love, commitment and solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe that brought about our independence,"" he said. Dr Mapfumo also hailed those who fought in different fronts and called on Zimbabwe to have a unity of purpose. ""When we were singing during the war -- it was about freedom, justice hence I coined my music ""Chimurenga"". Even though I was not holding a gun, it was a difficult terrain and I was constantly harassed, arrested and detained because I denounced oppression and colonialism. My dream was to see a free Zimbabwe where our citizens are able to access education, health, access to decent accommodation, and above all a better life for everyone. ""Today, we need all hands on deck to do more to make real the dream of equality, justice and a better life for all. The brutalities of the past; detentions without trial, disappearances of our people, deaths in detentions, hanging of those opposed to colonialism, imprisonment, exile, massacres, assassinations, forced evictions, banishments, the Law and Order Maintenance Act and many more laws that made the lives of black people unbearable - are testimonies that our freedom was never free. ""Although today we walk tall because our collective efforts culminated in the 18th of April being our Independence Day, we all still carry scars that remind us that our freedom, which is at times taken for granted was never free,"" he said. And to fellow artistes, Dr Mapfumo thanked superstar Oliver Mtukudzi for assisting the youngsters saying he was prepared to work with upcoming artistes. ""As artistes we have a role to play in national development, fostering unity and also acting as ambassadors of our great nation. In the last 34 years I am happy to note how our music has developed over the years, I salute all the young musicians who are emerging and I am prepared to assist and work with the young crop of musicians. ""They need our guidance and support - they are our future. My friend Oliver Mtukudzi has been doing a good job in assisting the upcoming musicians. Keep up the good work you are doing,"" he said.

Heroes and heroines who fought to liberate this country did not sacrifice so that some misguided bureaucrats and politicians could sell the land to land-hungry citizens. As such, we condemn the alleged practice by former Zanu-PF councillor for Mayo Ward in Makoni District, Cde James Munetsi, and all the officials in the Ministry of Lands and Rural Resettlement in that area who are said to have connived to induce landless people to pay them money so that they could get farms. That having been said, the 240 people who say they lost money to Cde Munetsi in the hope of getting farms also deserve a measure of censure for willingly entering into corrupt dealing. Had these people not been conned as they allege, they were perfectly happy to pay bribes to get farms. More shocking is the fact that many of these bribes were paid through a church, Faith in God Ministries! We hear that this corrupt practice of paying Government officials to access land is widespread. Thankfully, Lands Minister Dr Douglas Mombeshora has promised to get to the bottom of the matter. We eagerly await the outcome of his investigations and -- if there is evidence of illegalities -- the guilty must answer for their actions. The land reform programme is a noble empowerment policy that has benefited over 250 000 families under the A1 and A2 farming models. We cannot allow a few bad apples to taint the entire programme because of their greed. Demand for land will continue to grow as the population grows and there is need to properly manage this finite resource. As such, Government must rationalise farm sizes so that all those in need of land, and who are capable and willing to exploit it, actually benefit. This can immediately be done by identifying underutilised land for redistribution. Having a big farm but not using it creates land pressures and fuels graft, in addition to not benefiting the nation. Government should create more awareness on the process of applying for land so that people know how to go about it. Further to that, the entire process must be made as transparent and expeditious as possible to cut out corruption by officials and land-hungry people. People must be aware that at present, land is applied for through district land committees chaired by district administrators, and those who want A2 farms will have their approved applications forwarded to provincial lands committees chaired by provincial ministers. All these stages are free and no cent is paid. Those who qualify are given offer letters or permits as the case may be. Government must do something, especially at district level, to ensure officials do not ask for payments to facilitate applications and allocations."544,The Herald (Harare),4/25/14,'Corruption Threatens Zim-Asset Implementation',,ZIMBABWE (96%); CHINA (79%); BRAZIL (79%); INDIA (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,25-Apr-14,,552 words,"CORRUPTION (90%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (89%); REGULATORY COMPLIANCE (78%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (78%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (75%); BRIC COUNTRIES (73%); TRADE SHOWS (71%); INTERNATIONAL TRADE (71%); POWER PLANTS (68%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (68%); ALLIANCES & PARTNERSHIPS (60%); WORKING CAPITAL (50%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Economy, Business and Finance","Vice President Joice Mujuru has warned against corruption, saying it threatens the successful implementation of the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation (Zim-Asset). In a speech read on her behalf by Senior Minister of State in the President's Office Simon Khaya Moyo on Wednesday at the Zimbabwe International Business Conference held concurrently with the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair in Bulawayo, VP Mujuru said there should be no room for corruption if the country was to develop. The conference was themed ""Technology and innovation: A key pillar for Zim-Asset successful implementation"". VP Mujuru said there was a need for the country's socio-economic framework to be flexible to accommodate ideas that add value to development efforts. She said it was everyone's duty to contribute and work hard to improve the country's economy. ""There should be no room for corruption. Corruption destroys all efforts to improve the country's economic title. I call upon everyone to be forthright and make a contribution to the building of this great country,"" said VP Mujuru. ""Everyone can make a difference in improving the country's economy. In operationalising Zim-Asset we need to invoke the spirit of hard work, honesty and righteousness."" VP Mujuru said Government had brought to an end the awarding of exorbitant public sector packages. Recently, Government directed that no one in the public sector should earn more than US$6 000 a month following media exposures of what is now being referred to as salarygate, where some executives at State-linked institutions were paying themselves up to US$500 000 monthly. Turning to infrastructure, VP Mujuru said Government was aware of the energy deficit and in the short-term, the State was committing money to rehabilitation and maintenance of existing power infrastructure to achieve optimal performance. ""This has seen the country's power stations increasing output to averages of 600 megawatts for Hwange, 750MW for Kariba and 100MW for the small thermal stations. ""Rehabilitation of the grid is also in progress with major equipment such as transformers and switchgear being renewed or replaced. ""This will minimise power losses and enhance security of supply,"" said VP Mujuru. She said Government was engaging regional and other co-operating partners, such as Brazil, Russia, India and China, for affordable working capital. Minister of State for Bulawayo Provincial Affairs Eunice Nomthandazo Moyo said the country's challenges, which included illegal Western sanctions, could only be addressed via clear and accurate interpretation and implementation of Zim-Asset. ""There is a definite need to innovate and utilise newer and more efficient technologies that will ensure compliance with the competitive global standards. ""I believe that this conference, which will serve as a pillar for Zim-Asset's successful implementation will carry Bulawayo along, especially in the fields of technology and other innovative programmes as a revival of industries,"" said Minister Moyo.

Senior Features Writer Tichaona Zindoga (TZ) spoke to Mr Ngoni Katsvairo (NK), secretary-general of Greater Harare Association of Commuter Operators, which represents 1 000 kombi owners. The following are excerpts. So when that chaos is created you will also find that corruption thrives because there is a conducive environment for operators to be corrupt and also for bad apples in the police to be corrupt. We need to deal with the issue holistically because corruption needs everybody's efforts to be eradicated or reduced. When I don't have documents or the driver goes to an undesignated place, that's where the problem is. That's where people are hit by vehicles because every time the driver is loading his vehicle, he is always on the lookout for police because he knows that he will be loading from an unauthorised place. But, above all, you will find that even the ranks where the kombi is supposed to be loading, there is not enough space. We also have a problem with the city council's licensing. I recently acquired a licence for my vehicle to ply the City-Epworth route. My licence number is 6300, which means that they are 6 300 vehicles in Harare that are officially registered. So maybe they are another 4 000 to 5 000 that don't have documents. But we only have four ranks in town and these ranks have been there since the deregulation of the transporter sector in the mid-1990s. So those ranks have become insufficient. We were talking of a population of about 300 000 for Harare, or 500 000, less than a million but now it's over two million so that population which has risen has seen a corresponding growth of the vehicle population. Since the ranks are not enough all those vehicles you are now finding them on the streets; and most of those vehicles that you find on the streets are the ones that do not have papers and they would rather not use the ranks. Then the issue of touts as well, it comes in. We have a situation whereby a driver gives the vehicle to another person who then does these mischievous things on the streets. So the kind of drivers that we are having, some of them - if not most of them - are not up to scratch with what is required and we have presented the issues to the Ministry of Transport and they are working on it. We agree that for there to be safety on our roads, we need to have experienced drivers. That's why we agree with the issue of a (public transport) driver being 25 years old, having five years' experience and being medically fit having been examined by a Government medical doctor. The issue of going for a retest after five years is not enough. So for sure there is an element of drug abuse within our streets and within the ranks. The issue of touts needs to be dealt with once and for all. We know it was dealt with before but the people have come back again; they are the same people who are connected to some of the police officers as they can collect money from non-compliant kombi operators and drivers and pass it on to police officers on the roads, giving a list of kombis that have paid and those that have not paid and then the whole sequence goes like that. Once that has happened we find that these vehicles that don't have enough papers are finding their way into the CBD yet they should be stopped before they get into the CBD to cause chaos. We need to work with the police to ensure that all the vehicles that do not have requisite papers are weeded out. We are encouraging all operators to be compliant. First and foremost to fight corruption we have to be compliant. If you are not compliant then you are corrupt. The same also applies for the police, they should enforce the rules as they are. If they are not enforcing it means they are corrupt because they are the ones who are supposed to be weeding out those vehicles without relevant papers. This must also apply to drivers who do not have relevant papers. It takes two to tango. When we have five roadblocks they should ensure that a vehicle with excess passengers should not pass until it drops off the excess number. The current system of fines, which can be as low as US$10, is not deterrent enough as the kombi crews will always return. There is need to properly punish repeat offenders. At one point we had to go to Parliament to ask for such a change of laws. If you look at it, when a vehicle operating illegally gets towed away by council, it is the kombi owner that pays US$132 in penalties and the driver goes unpunished. The driver needs to be incarcerated so that tomorrow he will not do it again. If I, as an operator, ask him to go to these places they call ""mushikashika"", the driver should have the right to refuse because he knows that if he is caught there he will be jailed. On the other hand, we also need to find ways of funding police operations as spot fines are serving to encourage corruption. We would rather have a Policing Levy collected by, say, Zinara on behalf of police instead of paying fines which are sometimes resulting in abuse."558,The Herald (Harare),6/20/14,"Corruption, All in a Day's Work [column]",,ZIMBABWE (95%),Newspaper,Lloyd Gumbo,ENGLISH,20-Jun-14,,1236 words,ACCOUNTING (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); MISAPPROPRIATION (90%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (90%); AUDITS (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); APPOINTMENTS (72%); CIVIL SERVICES (71%); CONSTITUTIONAL LAW (65%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Governance,"Let's stop institutionalising corruption if we are serious about developing this country. Zimbabweans are sick and tired of being told how their money is being stolen or misused without action being taken against the perpetrators. They are slowly losing faith in our country's ability to curb corruption. Looting in Government ministries, departments and State entities has continued unabated because we encourage it through our negative actions. It would be mischievous to suggest that the recent ""Salarygate"" scam was a new phenomenon in Zimbabwe when it has gone on for a very long time. Sadly, nothing has been done against the perpetrators. Every year the Comptroller and Auditor-General's Office, now Auditor-General's Office, exposes corruption and misappropriation of funds by Government officials and those mandated to run State entities. Audit reports are presented in Parliament, MPs kick, swear and scream while the media are saturated with stories from the reports, yet we still fall short on action. University of Zimbabwe's Tawanda Zinyama in the Journal article titled: ""Efficiency and Effectiveness in Public Sector Auditing: An Evaluation of the Comptroller and Auditor-General's Performance in Zimbabwe from 1999 to 2012"" quotes the Kavran Report of 1989 stating that though the CAG was effective and efficient in discharging its constitutional mandates, it had no teeth to bite. As a result, misappropriation and theft of public funds and assets have flourished because of the blatant rent-seeking actions of those entrusted with leading ministries, departments or parastatals knowing nothing will happen to them. The State spends so much paying auditors to check if Government ministries, departments and State entities are spending money according to the book and more often than not the Auditor-General has unearthed massive irregularities. Ministers, top civil servants and State entity heads have been implicated but it has remained business as usual. The new Constitution has also failed to give the Auditor-General enforcement mechanisms on audit recommendations. Parliament does not have the powers either, while the Executive, who are supposed to be the complainants, sometimes do not live up to expectation considering that ministers are the ones who appoint boards and often influence the appointment of management into parastatals despite their denial. While the Constitution provides that all institutions and agencies of the State and Government at every level are accountable to Parliament, it is not enough for MPs to just know that public funds are being misappropriated while assets are being personalised yet no action is taken against offenders. Let's accept it, financial indiscipline has reached unparalleled levels in State entities to the extent that only radical action will burn the cancer. Zinyama states that: ""Parliament relies on the Public Auditor (Auditor-General) to provide independent assurance that Government activities are carried out and accounted for, consistent with Parliament's intentions."" It is out of such a background that we have the Auditor-General's Office producing volumes, year in and year out, on how public funds would have been used or misused during the course of the year. Let us be honest, at times the reports from the Office are so damning that you would mistake them for satanic verses and expect to see the ""sinners"" in the gallows the next minute. But they are still breathing the same oxygen as victims if not better given their air-conditioned offices, homes and vehicles. The Auditor-General's Office is on record moaning that it has no ""whip"" to crack on Government officials and parastatal bosses implicated by the audits in the misappropriation of funds, embezzlement and other fraudulent activities. We read of serious misuse of Government vehicles. In some cases, vehicles vanish into thin air. There is also rampant inflation of figures during tender processes and unbridled flouting of procurement procedures influenced by favouritism and brown envelopes. The question that continuously boggles the mind is, does Parliament have teeth at all? Is it not letting its electors down by debating these reports, only for them to gather dust in the shelves of Parliament? The fact that every year Parliament receives damning reports from the Auditor-General's Office through the Public Accounts Committee which subsequently debates and sometimes invites the parastatals and Government institutions involved for hearings, should be a first step towards accountability. In some instances one realises some smokescreen approach to issues where officers involved are put on suspension with full benefits or at times ""advised"" to resign just to protect whoever is involved in the scam. Kenya's Dr Munene in the Hansard of November 23, 1972 had some strong points on the Public Accounts Committee, which should be instructive to our Public Accounts committees to this day. ""Mr Speaker Sir, I am glad to speak on this motion, especially at this particular time when Members of Parliament are currently debating the Public Accounts Committee of 1970/1971. ""Mr Speaker Sir, if there is any dog without teeth, it is this House and I think what was said by the British government can apply very well to this House. Without teeth, there is no use saying that you can bite. There is no use keeping a dog that cannot bite. ""Mr Speaker Sir, we definitely need this committee. It spends a lot of money, a lot of Honourable Members' time interviewing all accounting officers. However, what happens after that is that the document it compiles becomes Government property locked up in the back doors of this House. ""This is unfair to this House and the public at large. I also think the accounting officers also laugh at us because they know that Members of the Public Accounts Committee are sensible but are made to do a useless job . . . We either abolish the committee or we give it teeth to bite,"" Dr Munene said. This was said in 1972 and aptly applies to our situation as if it only happened yesterday. Prophetic words indeed from Dr Munene. We have vehicles disappearing in ministries without trace like the Malaysian plane MH370 while orders worth millions of dollars are made and paid for but no trace of delivery. For instance, the CMED issue where almost US$7 million has been lost in a fuel scam currently under investigation by the Portfolio Committee on Transport and Infrastructural Development. The electorate don't care that parliamentarians do not have arresting powers. All they know is that they are there to watchdog on their behalf and ensure that our money and resources are not personalised by greedy individuals who want to hide behind political connections. Mr Speaker Sir, the House, the Public Accounts Committee, your committees, need teeth to bite and it is only you who can make the laws to ensure every cent is accounted for and that those who abuse public funds are dealt with decisively. The Public Accounts Committee plays an important role in the oversight of public funds and should continuously be seen to be doing so. Why do public officers with so much disdain reply to audit observations by saying ""noted"" when blatant cases of corrupt activities are evident in their work? The mandate of this committee is to, as Robert Sheldom envisaged, ""never to allow the taxpayer to get anything less than full value for the money that is spent on his behalf."""562,The Herald (Harare),7/5/14,UZ Students Form Anti-Corruption Group,,ZIMBABWE (94%); AFRICA (94%); UNITED STATES (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,5-Jul-14,,439 words,CORRUPTION (93%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (91%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (91%); CIVIL RIGHTS (89%); YOUTH CLUBS & ACTIVITIES (78%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (78%); BRIBERY (78%); EMBEZZLEMENT (73%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION (73%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (73%); RELIGION (63%); SECONDARY SCHOOLS (52%) Zimbabwe; Corruption,"A GROUP of University of Zimbabwe students have formed an anti-corruption organisation called Future Africa whose thrust is to empower youths with resourceful information and mould them into responsible citizens. The founding chairman of organisation, David Chikwaza said students saw the need to form such an organisation after realising that they lacked practical skills in dealing with real life situations. He the idea of the organisation also came as result of realising how corruption had become so endemic in the social and economic fabric of the country. ""We are encouraged by the efforts being undertaken by the Government to deal with the corruption scourge. Our thinking is that as youths we must also do something about creating a corruption-free generation and we must start inculcating a sense of uprightness at a young level so that they become responsible adults,"" said Chikwaza. Chikwaza said the organisation seeks to encourage the youths to be innovative and not allow their background or environment to discourage them from having big dreams about their country and continent. ""We want to see an Africa where we are free from bribery, embezzlement, and kickbacks, abuse of public office or private property for private gains. It might seem like we are beating a dead horse but we are encouraged by the fact that everything starts as a dream and dreams do come true,"" he said. Chikwaza said the organisation intends to visit both primary and secondary schools to educate pupils on the need to be upright and shun devious acts that are detrimental to their social development as future leaders. ""It is also our intention to invite prominent business people, political leaders, religious leaders and several people who have made it in various fields to impart their knowledge at some workshops that we have earmarked for this year,"" said Chikwaza. He said while ridding society of corruption may seem like an illusion, the youths must be encouraged by the diligent works of our forefathers and people like Martin Luther King Jr who persevered against all odds for equal civil rights for the black man in America. Chikwaza said Future Africa is a non-profit making youth organisation whose vision is to raise a corrupt free generation of God fearing citizens, principled leaders, public sector officers who are honest and diligent. He said he was inspired by President Mugabe who has repeatedly reinforced the idea that ""investing in young people will produce successful generations."" The organisation's membership is open to all University of Zimbabwe students but will encompass membership from other institutions in the future."569,The Herald (Harare),8/8/14,Corruption - Time to Bell the Cat [editorial],,ZIMBABWE (96%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,8-Aug-14,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (92%)",518 words,"CORRUPTION (90%); CONTRACT AWARDS (90%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); ECONOMIC NEWS (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); EXTORTION (73%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (67%); MISDEMEANORS (66%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (62%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Economy, Business and Finance","FINANCE and Economic Development Minister Patrick Chinamasa has once again raised a red flag over the endemic matter of corruption in Zimbabwe. This time around, Minister Chinamasa trained his eagle eye on the State Procurement Board. Speaking at a ""Buy Zimbabwe"" procurement conference in Harare earlier this week, Minister Chinamasa noted that there were murky deals in the awarding of tenders in both Government and the private sector. He noted that sometimes deserving companies failed to win tenders to supply materials while briefcase companies without the capacity to deliver were awarded such contracts. Minister Chinamasa described the country's tendering system as the ""capital city of corruption"" which had the effect of increasing the cost of doing business in the country. He said he had to intervene in some cases to get the job done. The minister said it was important to do ""due diligence"" on all companies tendering for contracts because often some of them ""come to bid yet they don't own anything,"" he said. He said it was vital to eliminate middlemen and the collusion between members of the SPB and briefcase companies. We have seen instances of this in the ongoing probe at CMED where some companies reportedly won tenders to supply fuel which they didn't have. ""When you talk about corruption, be it in Government or the private sector, first look at the procurement system,"" Minister Chinamasa said, describing it as ""central"" to the economic value chain. But he pointed out, ""This is the capitalist city of corruption."" The issue of corruption has been raised at many private and public fora. It is a cancer that even President Mugabe has acknowledged. It pervades all sectors of society, and now has spread to politics and churches. Unfortunately, the law enforcement agencies themselves, particularly the police, who should be apprehending the suspects, have not acquitted themselves well. Roadblocks along the country's highways have allegedly turned into havens for extortion and other forms of corruption. This has helped defy the adage, ""set a thief to catch a thief"". In Zimbabwe we have thieves protecting each other. Corruption by its very nature is very difficult to detect as it involves people who know and agree to break the law. This is why it is often so difficult to detect and combat it. There was some excitement earlier this year when media exposed corruption in most Government or state-linked entities. There was hope that finally something was being done. It turned out in the end that it was probably easier to expose misdemeanours as corruption than it was to make the charges stick. As a result, the State could not prosecute those suspected of gross corruption. What all this has done is to expose the country's lack of training and capacity to prove corruption and that a crime has been committed. Thus while it is important that Minister Chinamasa is once again casting the spotlight on corruption in the tendering system, people are justified to be less enthusiastic about any practical steps being taken. Will offenders be exposed and tried this time around? People want action."575,The Herald (Harare),9/23/14,Judiciary Raises the Bar in War Against Corruption,,ZIMBABWE (93%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,23-Sep-14,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (79%)",319 words,CORRUPTION (94%); MAGISTRATES (91%); STRATEGIC PLANNING (72%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"The judiciary has come up with strategies to combat corruption in the magistrates' courts countrywide to correct perceptions that the widespread plague is acceptable in the magistracy, Chief Magistrate Mr Mishrod Guvamombe has said.

Mr Guvamombe said this while presenting a paper at the JSC workshop held in Harare at the weekend. ""Our campaign against corruption would, among other things, be achieved by insisting on high integrity levels in the judiciary,"" he said. The chief magistrate said they have also put anti-corruption posters at prominent places at all court centres as a mechanism of fighting corrup- tion. ""Each poster is headlined by an anti-corruption slogan, which calls for zero tolerance towards corruption and each presents a cartoon and structures that would be effective in the fight against corruption,"" said Mr Guvamombe. ""The main aim is to build awareness of the dangers of corruption by poster campaigning. This would conscientise members of the public on what steps to take if they detect corruption."" Mr Guvamombe also said they would use training workshops as another effective measure to combat corruption in the lower courts. The training, he said, would cover magistrates and support staff on the aspects of the bad effects of corruption. ""Corruption is a menace, which must be eradicated with the participation of every member of staff,"" said Mr Guvamombe.

Zimbabwe is not immune to corruption and, for that reason, has established, through the Constitution, two institutions to fight corruption, the Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Emmerson Mnangagwa has said. He was speaking at the annual conference of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Zimbabwe held in Bulawayo last week. The Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission is established in terms of Section 254 of the Constitution and is mandated to, among other things, investigate and expose cases of corruption in the public and private sectors and to promote honesty, financial discipline and transparency. Section 255(1) (e) of the Constitution empowers the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission to direct the Commissioner-General of Police to investigate cases of suspected corruption and to report to the Commission of the results of any such investigation. ""The Commissioner-General of Police must comply with any directive given him or her by the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission. The Commission is also able to refer matters to the National Prosecuting Authority for prosecution,"" said Minister Mnangagwa. The National Prosecuting Authority is established in terms of Section 258 and it is responsible for instituting and undertaking criminal prosecutions on behalf of the State. The NPA is therefore the responsible authority for ensuring that individuals or entities that have engaged in corrupt or fraudulent activities are brought before the courts and dealt with accordingly. ""These two entities are required to carry out their functions without fear or favour. It is essential that criminal prosecutions are carried out against corrupt and fraudulent individuals so as to send a clear message to would be perpetrators that they are answerable to the law,"" said Minister Mnangagwa. The Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act (Chapter 9:23) criminalises various acts which are regarded in society as being of a corrupt nature, according to the minister. ""Section 170 of the Act, for example, makes it an offence for one to obtain or agree to obtain, or to solicit or agree to solicit for a bribe. ""There are also pieces of legislation that have been enacted to try and eliminate any fraudulent activities within the public sector such as the Procurement Act (Chapter 22:14) which sets out specific procedures that must be followed when a procuring entity seeks to procure goods or services,"" he said. Minister Mnangagwa said accountability and transparency are key result areas identified in the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation. Zim-Asset is the country's economic blueprint aimed at ensuring economic growth. Minister Mnangagwa said accountants have a critical role to play as they have technical expertise and know how relating to financial transactions. ""The fight against corruption is one which requires all sectors of society to participate as professional accountants cannot win this fight alone."" said Minister Mngangagwa."588,The Herald (Harare),11/10/14,Anti-Poaching Efforts Under Pressure From Corruption,,ZIMBABWE (92%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%),Newspaper,Jeffrey Gogo,ENGLISH,10-Nov-14,,1352 words,CYANIDES (92%); WILDLIFE (92%); POISONINGS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); ARRESTS (90%); POLICE FORCES (90%); ANIMAL POACHING & TRAFFICKING (89%); CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES CRIME (89%); NATIONAL PARKS (89%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (89%); FISHES (78%); MURDER (78%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (78%); ADMISSIONS & CONFESSIONS (74%); PRIMARY SCHOOLS (74%) Zimbabwe; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"POLICE in Dete recently arrested two suspects on allegations of killing three elephants by cyanide poisoning. However, the real kingpins behind wildlife gangs remain untouchable, even after previous convictions, due to alleged corruption within the justice system. Acting on a tip-off, police two weeks ago nabbed Ishmael Sibanda (32) and his accomplice Anold Ndhlovu (26), both from Sihazela Line under Chief Mswigama, Tsholotsho, in a joint crackdown on wildlife murderers with the Parks and Wildlife Authoriry. The duo confessed to killing two elephants in the Hwange National Park in December 2012 before slaughtering another in August this year, according to a police report obtained by The Herald Business. They were also charged with contravening the Environmental Management Act for the illegal possession of 6,850 kilogrammes of cyanide, which was buried underground. Poachers are now killing wildlife by poisoning watering holes or salt pans with cyanide, a deadly and fast acting chemical compound. By using poison, poachers avoid the risk of a gunshot being overheard by rangers. This is an emerging sophistication in wildlife crime that has got authorities and conservationists greatly worried. At different times, Sibanda and Ndhlovu allegedly sold their six pieces of ivory loot for just $520 to one Busani Moyo - believed to be one of the syndicate's ring leaders - and to Stanley Alias SaOga. Not much is known about this SaOga, police said, but he's techno savvy, even in crime. Ndhlovu received $20 as final payment from SaOga through EcoCash - a mobile money based payment platform, which was settled using a third party's phone, that of Mr Collen Ncube, a teacher at Sihazela Primary School. In South Africa, a pair of elephant tusks is believed to fetch as much as $16 000, making illegal ivory trade a lucrative business. Now, the arrested accomplices are just two small-time fish in the swelling pond of wildlife poaching teeming with powerful sharks, and were merely acting on higher orders. And the orders were from suspected kingpins, Busani Moyo and Lukas Nhliziyo, who supplied the cyanide for free. Police confirmed 1,850kg of the poison originated from Moyo and 5kg from Nhliziyo, who would later purchase the ivory. The two, who remain at large, are believed to be part of a ""well-known"" and organised criminal syndicate operating in Hwange and the Victoria Falls, terrorising wildlife with impunity. Sources said the Moyo/Nhliziyo ""syndicate has National Parks and ZRP details working within their ranks, and we strongly suspect they have corrupted the prosecutors."" Interestingly, Moyo was convicted for illegal possession of 237kg of ivory last year and senteced to 9 years imprisonment with labour. He is currently walking free, ostensibly on bail pending appeal. However, it is situations such as Moyo's that have raised questions on the integrity and competence of Zimbabwe's justice system in effectively tackling rampant poaching, particularly of the endangered rhino and elephant. ""These syndicates are very brazen, and have been operating with impunity for years now,"" sources said, adding if the vice was not contained ""Victoria Falls and Hwange will become the epicentre of elephant poisoning and illegal ivory trading."" Some conservationists recently ""arrested"" one of the Victoria Falls gang leaders carrying unquantified amounts of cyanide in his vehicle, as he headed towards Deka Safari Area, possibly to poison drinking water. But ""the police here were very accommodating to him, and the prosecutor apparently has refused to take any further action,"" alleged one conservationist who cannot be named for fear of victimisation. ""If the law is going to turn a blind eye to poaching, it will not be long before we have massive poisoning of elephant, on an unprecedented scale, which will have serious ramifications for the tourist industry and the economy."" Last year Zimbabwe suffered its worst wildlife carnage in a quarter century after 300 elephants and several other animals were killed by cyanide poisoning in Hwange. When asked about the corruption allegations, Prosecutor General Mr Johannes Tomana first hurled insults at this writer, saying ""this was childish, you cannot just make wild accusations."" He later calmed down after evidence of such claims were presented to him confirming that ZRP Dete were actually investigating the case and were on the hunt for Moyo and Nhliziyo. While Mr Tomana had not yet responded to questions sent to him by email on October 30, he told me by telephone last Thursday that ""you know we have zero tolerance to corruption. ""We are working with the Wildlife Authority to investigate the matter. Will advise when investigations are complete."" Parks and Wildlife Authority spokesperson Caroline Washaya Moyo was not immediately available to answer to allegations of corruption against her organisation. Environment, Water and Climate Minister Saviour Kasukuwere has at various times called for stiffer penalties against wildlife offenders, tasking the Wildlife Authority to strengthen its 'foot soldiers' in affected areas and work collaboratively with the police and the Environmental Management Agency. His deputy, Mr Simon Musanhu told The Herald Business in an interview in September that the Ministry was ""now aiming and pushing for a minimum mandatory sentence of 15 years in jail for wildlife offenders."" While some arrests have been made, it is shocking how individuals can get access to 7kg of cyanide, a chemical supposedly tightly controlled in Zimbabwe. Wildlife conservationists working in Victoria Falls said that much amount of cyanide was enough to kill hundreds of elephants in Hwange National Park, the country's largest game reserve holding half of the estimated 80 000 elephant herd here. At least 15g of the poison will be enough to kill an adult 6 tonne elephant, according to Dr Kathryn Harkup, a UK chemist and freelance science communicator. That means with 7kg, the poachers could have easily laid to waste over 450 elephants. It cannot be said enough Zimbabwean authorities need to do more against poaching, but they must now also begin to tightly monitor the movement of cyanide as well as root out corruption from the law system. In September, renowned conservationist and Zimbabwe's rhino ambassador Charlene Hewat expressed disappointment that ""poachers are caught and are let off on a very small bail."" ""The key to putting a stop to poaching is to make sure that our laws are enforced and that poachers do not get the bail that is the current trend,"" Hewat fumed after seeing two suspected poachers in Victoria Falls released on $200 bail. Wildlife trafficking is now a multi-billion dollar industry. Worldwide, $10 billion worth of wildlife and wildlife products are traded illegally each year. The major source markets of illegal ivory in Africa are South Africa, Kenya and Tanzania. Poaching is also rife in Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Uganda and in other African countries in the north and west. In 2013, over 20 000 African elephants were killed illegally for their ivory, according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The figure was a decline on 2011 and 2012 poaching levels, but remains unsustainably high. Legal ivory trade is strongly controlled by the CITES. But over 500kg of ivory meant for the black market were seized before they left the continent last year. CITES blames the high poaching incidents in Africa to poverty and weak governance structures. In most African countries, weak funding from central governments has left multi-national donors and private individuals having to dig deeper into their own pockets to combat poaching. Here, over US$750 000 has this year been poured by donors towards rhino and elephant conservation. The 2014 National Budget transferred twice that much money to the Parks and Wildlife Authority, primarily to finance the purchase of vehicles for anti-poaching activities. That money is barely sufficient in an industry controlled by wealthy, organised and powerful thieves. God is faithful."605,The Herald (Harare),1/20/15,Kanyekanye in Corruption Scandal - Altim Board Suspends Him for Misconduct,,BOTSWANA (91%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,20-Jan-15,,636 words,MISCONDUCT (91%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (89%); EXECUTIVES (78%); SCANDALS (78%); BUDGETS (77%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (77%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (73%); LIQUIDATIONS (73%); FORESTRY & LOGGING TRADE (73%); WOOD CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS (73%); SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY (69%); LABOR DISPUTES & NEGOTIATIONS (69%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (63%); LITIGATION (60%) Zimbabwe; Corruption,"ALLIED Timbers Zimbabwe, a state enterprise, has suspended its chief executive Dr Joseph Kanyekanye after the board raised several charges of misconduct against him. The suspension is with immediate effect and is meant to facilitate investigations into his conduct, which borders on corruption, failure to observe operating procedures and gross insubordination, group chairman Mr Emmanuel Fundira said. Dr Kanyekanye was sent on forced leave on December 10 last year to allow the board to independently evaluate the operations and financial position of the company. ""In view of the serious nature of the charges you are facing, I am hereby suspending you from duty without pay and benefits with immediate effect pending finalisation of this mater . . . ,"" Mr Fundira wrote to Dr Kanyekanye on January 14, 2015. ""You are therefore directed to surrender all company assets in your possession including the company motor vehicle to the board chairperson immediately upon receipt of this letter."" No comment could be immediately obtained from Dr Kanyekanye at the time of going to print. Outlining the charges, the group alleges Dr Kanyekanye failed to follow proper operating procedures and company policies resulting in substantial loss, harm or prejudice. For instance, an analysis of the debtors' book revealed that plus or minus 80 percent of the debtors did not go through the credit committee as per standard procedure. As a result of the procedural breach, the board says the unrecoverable debts for Botswana amounts to 4,85 million pula. Allied used to export timber products to Botswana. Further, local operations unsecured debtors book stands at $4,72 million. The board also established that Dr Kanyekanye extended unauthorised, unvetted and unsecured credit to ""related parties"", which remain unrecovered. For example, former Minister of Environment Francis Nhema was supplied with treated poles worth $25 000, unsecured credit still outstanding and unrecoverable. TS Timbers, said to be owned by Dr Kanyekanye's family associates and Nyika Enterprises, owned by businessman Mr Chester Mhende, were granted credit facilities worth $193 304 and $119 880, respectively. Both facilities are outstanding and unrecoverable. Clecko and Rubbertive, owned by Mr Gerald Mujaji, was a given an unsecured credit facility of $89 000 which has not been paid and the company has since been liquidated. It was also established that Dr Kanyekanye exceeded the $20 000 limit which he was permitted to buy items for capital programmes without going to tender and were overpriced. In 2012, Dr Kanyekanye directed the purchase of three slidetech machines at $75 000 each despite having been advised the same machines from Finland would cost $43 000 each. The prejudice suffered by Allied as a result of such ""fraudulent"" activities was $1,5 million. ""You have also led the company to face various litigations (arising from labour disputes) resulting in a contingency liability of $826 000 as per 2015 budget,"" said Mr Fundira. Dr Kanyakanye is also accused of failing to ensure sustainable forestry planting, resulting in a current year planting backlog of unplanted areas of 37 000 hectares. In addition, Dr Kanyekanye continued to receive housing allowance despite having accessed a housing loan in 2001, the year he joined the group. The company has also been operating without tax clearance certificate from Zimbabwe Revenue Authority and has not been paying corporate taxes, tax on motoring benefits and tax on rentals resulting in a tax and penalties liability of around $700 000. The outstanding pension deducted from workers but not remitted to the fund stands at $682 000. Dr Kanyakanye is said to have refused to provide the board with correct information regarding the debts, non-disclosure agreements, land ownership details and contracts."612,The Herald (Harare),2/9/15,Xala Explores Colonial Corruption of Natives,,AFRICA (95%); SENEGAL (90%); ZIMBABWE (78%); KENYA (78%),Newspaper,Lovemore Ranga Mataire,ENGLISH,9-Feb-15,,694 words,LITERATURE (91%); NOVELS & SHORT STORIES (89%); CORRUPTION (89%); MARRIAGE (87%); WRITERS (78%); CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE (73%); POLYGAMY (70%); BUSINESS & PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS (65%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (63%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Book Listings and Reviews,"MOST African literature is unique in the manner it portrays different themes that are directly linked to traditional beliefs of local communities. This uniqueness is exemplified by numerous works of native Africans writing about Africa. While it is correct that most influential African literature emerged at the end of colonialism, it is also true that most African writers derive inspiration from their portrayal of the residual effects of colonialism. However, while some literary works derive inspiration from the corrupting influences of colonialism and have consistently fought to ""preserve"" the reality of colonialism in their works to safeguard the history from being distorted, some have taken a different route that focuses on the examination of the hangover of colonialism that keeps haunting African states. The colonial hangover normally manifests itself among those that masquerade as Africans, while in reality they have simply taken the mantle of colonialists in their conduct by exploiting their kinsmen and engage in the same nefarious activities practised by colonialists. In Xala, Senegalese Sembene Ousmane, just like the Kenyan Ngugi wa Thiong'o in Matigari, is concerned with employing the supernatural as a liberating tool for the oppressed and a punitive strategy for the oppressors. As the novel begins, El Hadji Abdou Kader is at the peak of his business career and decides to marry a third wife N'Gone, a pretty woman who is also much younger than him. Taking a third wife is like a status symbol which places him in the realm of the affluent top African class. However, soon after his marriage, El Hadji suffers a personal calamity as his manhood fails to erect as he is struck by Xala, which in the Wolof language means impotence. He spends a lot of money consulting countless marabout healers to no avail. His Machiavelli character is aptly contextualised when the narrator says: ""El Hadji Abdou Kader Beye was what one might call a synthesis of two cultures: business had drawn him into European middle-class after a feudal African education. Like his peers he made a skilful use of his dual background, for their fusion was not complete."" The opening of the book is punctuated by the election of the first African to head the Senegalese Chamber of Commerce and Industry. This moment of triumph means ""access to the heart of the country's economy, a foothold in the world of high finance and of course the right to walk with the head held high."" Xala is thus part allegory, and several parts are a social critique addressing both polygamy and its effects on families as well as the corruption of the rising business class after independence. Although the type of the plot in the novel centres on social realism, the notion of the supernatural occupies the whole flow of events in the novel such that everything else revolves around it. El Hadji's third marriage becomes a farce as he becomes an object of ridicule. He is to later learn that the beggar who sings daily outside his office is the one who inflicted the Xala because of the way he treated him way back. The novel portrays the exploitation of Senegalese people while at the same time prophesying that their suffering will one day come to an end. El Hadji can thus be taken to represent the elite or the emerging bourgeoisie who oppress the beggar who represents that whole fraternity of the poor and the Xala symbolises the poor's means of struggle. El Hadji's fall from the sublime to the lowest ranks of society is what controls the plot with the Xala, which is beyond any scientific explanation symbolizing the triumph of the oppressed over the oppressors who are taking away the land of the poor as seen when Hadji grabs a piece of land from the beggar. Xala is a biting satire lacerated with a tone of seriousness for it is through El Hadji's tale that Ousmane is also narrating the story of exploitation of the poor by the elite who are now the new oppressors within the structures they have inherited from the colonial masters. El Hadji has no hesitation in spending money recklessly on his own foibles when they are beggars sitting outside his office for which he shows much contempt."616,The Herald (Harare),2/17/15,"Corruption Hits Women, Youth Hardest",,ZIMBABWE (95%),Newspaper,Ruth Butaumocho,ENGLISH,17-Feb-15,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (92%)",779 words,CORRUPTION (90%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (89%); BRIBERY (89%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (89%); TEMPORARY STAND RETAILING (89%); CIVIL SERVICES (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (77%); MOBILE FOOD SERVICES (76%); ECONOMIC STIMULUS (65%); FOOD SECURITY (64%); CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (50%) Zimbabwe; Women and Gender; Corruption,"Walking in the central business district in Harare last week, I came across a group of vendors, mostly women, in running battles with the municipal police for selling their wares on ""illegal vending sites"". The altercation ensued for a few minutes with the vendors pleading with the municipal cops to release their wares, which had been loaded into a waiting truck. After sometime, one of the municipal employees muttered something to his colleagues, followed by a brief discussion among the vendors, who now appeared lively and were now co-operating. Soon after, one of the female vendors exchanged a ""firm handshake"" with one of the municipal guys, who immediately ordered the release of the confiscated goods, before jumping into the car and driving off. Because I was a spitting distance from the melee, I did not get the content of the discussion. It was only after the municipal team had left that I concluded that money had exchanged hands. Even the vendors confirmed the transaction, saying it was nothing out of the ordinary. Corruption has become an endemic problem that Zimbabwe is grappling with. The country has in the last few years witnessed a rise in corruption, not only in the big offices and public institutions, but across the board, a development that has resulted in the country losing millions of dollars in lost revenues, and business opportunities that would have benefited and boosted the economy. Last year the media was awash with stories on corruption, looting of public funds, abuse of office and general mismanagement and poor corporate governance in the public sector. Sadly, this vice has become endemic and is heavily entrenched in Zimbabwe's societal values and its downstream effects have hurt the ordinary person most. It has become the norm for individuals and organisations alike to pay for services and products that under normal circumstances should be for free. Because corruption is crime of opportunity, individuals entrusted with public service and resources are now demanding payment upfront from individuals and organisations, further entrenching the vice that the country is trying to do away with. Ms Judith Kaulem, a spokesperson for Poverty Reduction Forum Trust, recently noted that the problem of corruption in Zimbabwe has adversely affected the country's general populace, mainly women, who have to grapple with the issue of food security within homes and the community at large. The mention of corruption often conjures images of people getting rich but in fact, corruption's connection to poverty is actually very serious and needs to be interrogated. There is more poverty created by poverty than there is wealth or riches. While the nation has been focusing on high levels of corruption and its impact, society has actually turned a blind eye on the different forms of downstream corruption that has had a direct impact on the poor, mainly women and the youth. These included bribes, penalties for street vending and other illegal payments that ordinary citizenry come across on a daily service, in order to access goods and services. Most poor men and women whose families survive on proceeds from street vending have to ensure daily running battles with municipal police and are forced to pay bribes to avoid such battles. If a vendor records $10 of sales on a good day, his or her efforts will come to nothing, if he or she has to pay $3 a day to municipal police so that they are allowed to vend in the streets. Where a woman has to access health services for free at government hospitals, they end up bribing staff there in order to get treatment, while police officers at numerous roadblocks fleece commuter omnibus crews of their hard-earned cash. The amounts dropped at each point might seem small but relative to the limited cash at the poor woman or man's disposal, they are substantial. The problem of corruption has further dug deeper on deteriorating social services at a time when the nation is hoping to move forward While many organisations are not able to quantify the cost of corruption because of the different facets it has taken, the problem has become endemic with serious negative and long-term consequences, which in most cases affect the poor most. Corruption supports, stabilises and deepens all forms of inequality in societies, a situation that requires concerted effort to fight against all forms of corrupt tendencies. Corruption has a negative impact on the livelihood of the generality of the population in that when public funds are misused the effect culminates in low service delivery, low literate levels and poor health. The nation has a responsibility to protect the poor by shunning all forms of corruption."617,The Herald (Harare),2/17/15,'Constitution Alignment to Deal With Corruption',,ZIMBABWE (96%),Newspaper,Lovemore Mataire,ENGLISH,17-Feb-15,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (88%)",390 words,CORRUPTION (94%); LEGISLATION (89%); PUBLIC DEBT (78%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); PUBLIC FINANCE (73%); SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS (50%); CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (50%) Zimbabwe; Corruption,"The Government is expeditiously aligning laws with the new Constitution to deal with corruption cases that have reached alarming levels, Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa has said.Addressing students of the Joint Command and Staff Course Number 28 at the Zimbabwe Staff College in Harare last week on the Zimbabwe Constitution, VP Mnangagwa said the new Constitution has enough provisions for combating corruption. ""Chapter 13 of the Constitution further establishes institutions to combat corruption and crime,"" he said. ""Of note is the establishment of the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission. It can be conceded that the prevalence of corruption and fraudulent activities in our society is unacceptable and can only derail the efforts that are in place to achieve the goals set out in the Constitution."" VP Mnangagwa, who is also the Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, said it was imperative that all sectors of society work together to bring an end to corruption and to safeguard the economic interests of Zimbabwe. He said the new Constitution has provisions for the establishment of the National Prosecuting Authority, an independent institution tasked to undertake criminal prosecutions on behalf of the State. ""It is common place that criminal behaviour should not be tolerated in any society and thus the need for an independent institution to attend to the prosecution of criminal behaviour,"" VP Mnangagwa said. The enactment of the new Constitution in May 2013 ushered in a number of new obligations on the State. VP Mnangagwa said the Electoral Amendment Act, the National Prosecuting Authority Act, the Sovereign Wealth Fund Act and the Finance Act had already been signed into law, while the Gender Commission Bill and the Reserve Bank Debt Assumption Bill are at an advanced stage of alignment. Various other drafts of priority laws such the Local Authorities Bill, Land Commission Bill, the Public Debt Management Bill, the Public Sector Corporate Governance Bill, the National Peace and Reconciliation Commission Bill and the Joint Venture Bill have already been drafted. VP Mnangagwa said when the new Constitution was signed, all line ministries were expected to immediately identify laws under their respective portfolios for review and also formulate new policies that would lead to the enactment of new laws."619,The Herald (Harare),2/19/15,Corruption - a Cancer Eating Into Zimbabwe,,ZIMBABWE (97%),Newspaper,Conrad Gweru,ENGLISH,19-Feb-15,,707 words,CORRUPTION (90%); BUDGETS (90%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (75%); CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (71%); RAIL TRANSPORTATION (66%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Governance,"Vice President Emmerson Mnangwagwa recently noted that, "" . . . the prevalence of corruption and fraudulent activities in our society is unacceptable and can only derail the efforts that are in place to achieve the goals set out in the Constitution."" The cancer of corruption that is eating into Zimbabwe's public service delivery system, if not dealt with, will destroy the country's promising economy. That 22 ministries have been founding wanting on poor corporate governance, abuse of fund accounts and flouting procurement procedures was never an interesting read. Painfully, only 10 ministries were given a thumbs up by the auditors. One would expect Government to put measures in place to ensure that every cent is put to its intended use; and not only that, that we get value for money from each transaction made. Ironically, the officials at the same corrupt ministries always blame government for failing to provide adequate resources to operate efficiently. After every budget presentation, local authorities and ministries always complain of inadequate budgetary allocations. However, the bigger question is ""What have they done to justify the need for more resources with the limited resources allocated to them?"" Urban councils for example always blame inadequate resources for inefficient operation of councils but poor water and sewer reticulation systems are a result of mismanagement of finances and also prioritising incomes more than service. Far from that, the country's image must not be put at stake by a few selfish individuals working with no country at heart. There is no use of keeping individuals in office who prefer to distort the image of the country for self-centred gains. Government should come up with stringent measures to punish corrupt individuals, regardless of their positions in society, political affiliation or whom they are related to. Various scandals have afflicted Zimbabwe in the past including the National Railways Housing Scandal; Ziscosteel Blast Furnace Scandal; Willowgate Scandal, ZRP Santana Scandal to the so-called Salarygate scandal of last year. These had far reaching consequences to the country's image. The Auditors General report and many other visible signs provide overwhelming evidence that there is need for momentous changes in most ministries and parastatals. Transparency in financial and resource management deserves far greater attention in Zimbabwe than it has so far received. The implications for not doing so has far reaching consequences. The global village has its eyes on Zimbabwe for more than a decade now, and negative issue emanating from the country will receive wide spread publicity regardless of the intensity of the matter. Well, issues of low intensity have always been exaggerated by many western countries. Government should formulate a comprehensive public sector reform strategy, with the main objective of transforming processes and practices around financial management and achieving major objectives set for each ministry and parastatals. That parastatal heads contacts should be in line with Zim-Asset is a great idea which should be coupled with stringent financial control mechanisms. Lead ministries as mentioned in Zim-Asset document such as Ministries of Home Affairs; Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, and Finance, and Security Agencies should now prioritise setting up of systems to deal with mismanagement of resources. As indicated in the Zim-Asset document, this will include coming up with efficient tender processes; Code of ethics and values National Corporate Governance and restructuring of parastatals and state enterprises amongst others. The Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc), an organisation meant to deal with the corrupt elements in the country, should be adequately funded in order for it to discharge its mandate. Corrupt elements should not be involved with the commission in any way. Sometime last year, the commission was accused for mismanaging $5 million meant for employees m salaries, allowances and other packages. Apart from stringent control measures, cases of corruption should be investigated and those prosecuted and those found guilty should not only be put in prison but should return all resources looted."621,The Herald (Harare),3/3/15,Anti-Corruption Commission Boss Jailed,,ZIMBABWE (94%),Newspaper,Daniel Nemukuyu,ENGLISH,3-Mar-15,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (79%)",439 words,JAIL SENTENCING (91%); CORRUPTION (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); EXECUTIVES (89%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (78%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (78%); CORRECTIONS (77%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (77%); EVICTION (76%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (75%); PUBLIC FINANCE (73%); TRUST ARRANGEMENTS (69%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (68%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission chief executive Ngonidzashe Gumbo, was yesterday jailed for 10 years for defrauding the commission of $435 000. Gumbo, who is a former Senior Assistant Commissioner of the Zimbabwe Republic Police, had five years suspended on condition he is not convicted of any case involving dishonesty in the next five years. A further three years were set aside on condition that the House Number 20 Northend Road, Highlands that he bought using the tainted money is forfeited to the State. Effectively, Gumbo will serve two years in prison. Retired regional magistrate Mr Rodgers Kachambwa, ruled that paperwork giving effect to the forfeiture of the property must be done by August 31 this year. The magistrate found that Gumbo benefited from the offence and that the amount involved was quite substantial. It was the court's finding that Gumbo's moral blameworthiness was high considering that he was a former senior police officer and that he held a high position of authority. Law officer Mrs Sharon Fero represented the State. Gumbo bought offices to be used by the commission in Mt Pleasant, Harare using Government funds, but registered the property in the name of a company he jointly owned with four of his subordinates. The State proved that in 2010, ZACC approached the Home Affairs Ministry seeking alternative accommodation when their landlords were about to evict them. The ministry instructed Gumbo to look for alternative property and he identified 872 Betterment Close in Mt Pleasant that belonged to Diane Spalletah. Gumbo went back to the ministry where he requested for $1 680 000 to buy the property and Government deposited $1,7 million into a ZACC account. He instructed his subordinates Sukai Tongogara, Edwin Mubataripi, Christopher Chisango and Gibson Mangwiro to form a shelf company called Property Mortgage where they became directors with equal shares. A ZACC administration and human resources manager deposited the $1 680 000 into a CBZ account for Perpetual Properties trust account. It is believed that Gumbo's daughter was an administrator for Perpetual Properties and she was the one who did the transactions. The property was bought for $1,2 million, which was fully paid to the owner Spalletah by Perpetual Properties. Perpetual Properties deducted their commission amounting to $44 500, leaving a balance of $435 500. The court heard that $160 000 was used for the purchase of a property owned by Poptechnologies where Gumbo and Popatlal Samir are directors. A person called Da Silva was given $100 000, while Samir received $95 000. Gumbo is said to have allocated $80 000 for ""renovations."""642,The Herald (Harare),4/24/15,Zambia Police Top Corruption Rankings,,ZAMBIA (94%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,24-Apr-15,"LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (73%)",341 words,CORRUPTION (95%); BRIBERY (95%); POLICE FORCES (90%); TRENDS (78%); ROAD TRANSPORTATION SAFETY (76%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (72%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (71%); EXECUTIVES (69%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (65%); CITY LIFE (64%) Zambia; Corruption,"The Zambia Police Service has continued to be ranked as the country's most corrupt public institution, according to a 2014 bribe index released by a corruption watchdog yesterday. The 2014 Zambia Bribe Payers Index, jointly conducted by Transparency International Zambia (TIZ) and the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), shows that the police service topped the list of government institutions were bribery was rife followed by the Road Transport and Safety Agency (RTSA) on second position. According to the index, bribe demand increased by 6,7 percent in 2014 compared to 4,7 percent in 2012 and, bribery demand was most prevalent among supervisor and junior staff categories in the public service. The index shows that the level of bribery payment to the police increased to 78,3 percent in 2014 compared to 48,3 percent in 2012. The Index also shows that the prevalence of bribery worsened in 2014, with 57,1 percent of respondents paying bribes to public officials for a service compared to 44,6 percent in 2012. This is mainly due to avoiding delays, fear of service denial and the belief that it is a normal trend to pay a bribe. Other public institutions where corruption is still rife include local governments, National Registration Office, Ministry of Lands and Ministry of Education. Goodwell Lungu, the executive director of the corruption watchdog, said during the release of the index that most people pay bribes because they felt it was normal to do so. The organisation, he said, will start conducting awareness campaigns in the Zambia Police traffic section and the road safety agency as part of efforts to reduce the levels of corruption among officials in the two public institutions. ""Figures don't lie. The findings of the 2014 Zambia Bribe Payers Index to a considerable extent shows us that the magnitude, incidence and severity of corruption by the public when seeking public service is still undesirable, and that it has worsened in some instances and unfortunately it's prevalent among us who live in urban areas,"" he added.

Speaking at Mamutse Stadium in Masvingo after commissioning the $4,8 million Urgent Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation project bankrolled by the Zimbabwe Multi-Donor Trust Fund (Zim-Fund), the Acting President issued a strong warning against abuse of donor funds. He said every cent should be accounted for if Zimbabwe was to receive more assistance to tackle various challenges. The Acting President said Government was prepared to smoke out corrupt elements in the private sector as the vice posed serious threat to ongoing efforts to engender socio-economic development through Zim-Asset. ""On the issue of corruption, I want to make it very clear that as Government, we do not want corruption. We do not condone corruption, be it in the public sector or in the private sector. ""The current Zanu-PF Government is determined to end corruption and we will make sure that all corrupt elements are rooted out,"" he said. ""We closely monitor the situation in the public sector to weed out corrupt elements and we also do the same in the private sector so all the corrupt elements have nowhere to hide,""he said. Acting President Mnangagwa said Government would not hesitate to punish those who abused donor funds. ""If our co-operating partners discover that every cent of the money they would have donated has been put to good use, they will continue to assist us to plug our developmental challenges, but if they discover that their funds have been ambushed by corrupt officials, they will stop providing assistance,"" said the Acting President. Zimbabwe was prepared to work closely with Western countries that provided developmental assistance and not ""bully"" nations that were bent on oppressing and perpetuating neo-imperialism. ""Issues of water provision and sanitation are very critical to our country as they will also benefit our children and as a country we should also take time to unite around issues that bring development to our nation,""he said. Cde Mnangagwa took a dig at the opposition parties in the country for being pre-occupied with cheap political issues to the detriment of development. Local Government, Public Works and National Housing Minister Dr Ignatius Chombo said discharge of raw effluent into rivers, which posed serious threat to human and aquatic life in major cities, would be greatly reduced after completion of the water supply and sanitation rehabilitation programme. Environment, Water and Climate Minister Saviour Kasukuwere said the programme would improve water supply in Masvingo City, with daily supply rising from 24 mega-litres to 30 mega-litres per day. Speaking at the same event, Finance and Economic Development Minister Patrick Chinamasa said Zim-Fund was launched five years ago in response to an outbreak of cholera that claimed about 4 000 people in Zimbabwe. He said the cities of Masvingo, Harare, Chitungwiza, Chegutu, Kwekwe and Mutare would benefit under the water supply and sanitation rehabilitation programme. African Development Bank Zimbabwe Country Office resident representative, Mr Mateus Magala, said Australia, Denmark, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom poured $145 million into the Zim-Fund. Acting President Mnangagwa first toured Rujeko Sewer pump station and the Bushmead water treatment plant on the shores of Lake Mutirikwi where rehabilitation and expansion work was carried using money from the Zim-Fund."507,The Namibian (Windhoek),1/31/14,Wilberforce Nabbed for Corruption,,NAMIBIA (93%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%); AFRICA (73%),Newspaper,Denver Kisting,ENGLISH,31-Jan-14,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (90%)",208 words,CORRUPTION (92%); BOXING (92%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); ARRESTS (90%); SPORTS & RECREATION FACILITIES & VENUES (78%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); MAGISTRATES (77%); BAIL (73%); PRIME MINISTERS (70%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (70%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE reigning World Boxing Organisation (WBO) Africa super middleweight champion, Wilberforce ""Black Mamba"" Shihepo was arrested on Wednesday in connection with the alleged graft amounting to just over N$706.

At least four members of the public paid him various amounts ranging from N$300 to N$1 400 for him to get them jobs. According to sources at the ACC, although Kaiyamo promised employment to these people, the jobs never materialized despite being paid to facilitate. ""On conclusion of the investigations the case docket was forwarded to the Office of the Prosecutor-General who decided to arraign him on four charges of contravening section 35(1) (a) (corruptly accepting gratification by agent as an inducement) of the Anti-Corruption Act, Act no.8 of 2003,"" said the source.

""His case was remanded to the 5th of March 2014 pending a bail application on that date,"" said the source. Kaiyamo was in the past arrested on three other similar cases (ACC HQO 08-000874, ACC HQO 10-000229 and ACC HQO 11-000101). ""He was released on bail on these cases and is awaiting trial.

Justus Tjirimuje and Marvin Hengari were found not guilty of charges under the Anti-Corruption Act after Public Prosecutor Veiko Alexander wrapped up the case in their trial. Magistrate Cosmos Endjala found that the prosecution's evidence against the two would not support a conviction and did not warrant putting them on their defence at the end of the State's case. Each accused faced one main charge of offering a bribe - referred to as ""gratification"" in the Anti-Corruption Act - to a permanent secretary in an attempt to influence him to favour Italian company Impregilo's bid for the construction of the dam. Tjirimuje was accused of offering, on 14 December 2011, an unspecified benefit to the former permanent secretary in the Ministry of Regional and Local Government, Housing and Rural Development, Erastus Negonga, as an inducement to favour Impregilo by supporting its bid at a Tender Board of Namibia meeting, or by abstaining from the tender vote or absenting himself. The allegations against Hengari were that during December 2011 he tried to use a go-between to influence the then permanent secretary in the Ministry of Mines and Energy, Joseph Iita, to support Impregilo's bid at a Tender Board of Namibia meeting, or to be absent from the meeting or abstain from voting. Tjirimuje and Hengari, represented by defence lawyer Sisa Namandje, pleaded not guilty at the start of their trial on Thursday last week. During the trial, Iita testified that he did not know the two accused, and that an acquaintance, Silas Nekwaya, came to his house in December 2011 to tell him that Hengari had approached him with a request that he should try to convince Iita, who was supposedly known to be opposed to Impregilo's tender bid, not to attend the Tender Board meeting where the dam tender was to be discussed. Iita said Nekwaya also told him that he (Nekwaya) was promised a payment of N$2 million if Impregilo were to be awarded the tender, and that N$1 million would have been paid to Iita. He and Nekwaya then decided to do the right thing and that he would attend the Tender Board meeting and consider the tender bids on merit, Iita said. Iita agreed, when he was cross-examined by Namandje, that nobody suggested to him that he should act corruptly. Nekwaya testified that he had a 15-minute conversation with Hengari outside a restaurant in Windhoek in December 2011. Hengari asked him to help him (Hengari) to lobby Iita for him, Nekwaya said. He said when he met Iita, whom he has known since his childhood and regards as a mentor and father figure, he told Iita that Hengari had told him he (Nekwaya) would receive sub-contracting work worth N$2 million from the dam construction project. Hengari increased that offer to sub-contracting work with a total value of N$140 million the next day, Nekwaya said. When cross-examined by Namandje, Nekwaya agreed that Hengari did not make any suggestion that he should go and corrupt anybody. He also said he never told Iita that the PS should lobby the Tender Board on behalf of Hengari. Negonga testified that he met Tjirimuje at a lodge in northern Namibia on 14 December 2011, while he was on leave. He said Tjirimuje told him there was a tender on the Neckartal Dam project that he wanted Negonga, as a member of the Tender Board, to support. Negonga said he told Tjirimuje he was on leave and thus would not be attending a meeting of the Tender Board. Negonga further said Tjirimuje, who had told him he was in a partnership with an Italian company that took part in the Neckartal Dam tender, did not offer him any gratification in an attempt to influence him. He also said he could not be influenced with regard to a tender and that he would consider tenders only on merit. Impregilo lost out to Chinese competitor, China Henan International Cooperation Group, when the Tender Board first decided in December 2011 to award the Neckartal Dam construction contract to the Chinese company. That tender decision was cancelled soon afterwards. The Tender Board later decided to award the contract to an Italian company, Salini SpA. Salini has in the meantime merged with Impregilo to form the Salini Impregilo Group."528,The Namibian (Windhoek),3/11/14,Ex-Magistrate Denies Corruption Charges,,NAMIBIA (95%),Newspaper,Werner Menges,ENGLISH,11-Mar-14,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (90%)",416 words,MAGISTRATES (92%); BRIBERY (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (89%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); VEHICULAR OFFENSES (78%); GUILTY PLEAS (78%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (78%); ARRESTS (78%); WITNESSES (77%); TESTIMONY (77%); LAWYERS (75%); ARREST WARRANTS (73%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"A FORMER Oshakati-based magistrate pleaded not guilty to a total of 20 charges - including seven counts of corruptly using her office and two charges of soliciting or accepting a bribe - when she went on trial in the Windhoek High Court yesterday. Ex-magistrate Melaney Theron is denying each and every allegation being made against her, it is stated in a plea explanation by Theron that was handed to Judge Nate Ndauendapo after she pleaded not guilty to all of charges that she is facing. The State will have to prove each allegation against her, she also stated in the plea explanation. Theron made only one admission in the statement: that she was a magistrate at Oshakati Magistrate's Court from September 2010 to 15 August 2011. She was suspended from her position in mid-August 2011, and has subsequently resigned as a magistrate. Theron is facing a total of 20 main charges, consisting of seven counts of corruptly using her office or position for gratification, five counts of fraudulently concealing an offence by falsifying or destroying a document, which is also an offence under the Anti-Corruption Act, two charges of corruptly soliciting or accepting or agreeing to accept a bribe, and six counts of defeating or obstructing the course of justice. The offences of which Theron is accused are alleged to have been committed at the Oshakati Magistrate's Court between 26 May 2011 and 15 August 2011. The prosecution is alleging that Theron accepted amounts of money totalling N$6 600 from various people who were accused of traffic offences. She allegedly used that money for her personal benefit. It is also alleged that she cancelled warrants of arrest that had been issued against the accused traffic offenders, and that she in some instances recorded on court records that the cases against the people had been withdrawn or that they had been cautioned after they had pleaded guilty, while they in fact had not appeared in court.

His record over the past few years is not flattering. And to kill off any iota of doubt, Nghimtina needs to do what Michael Jackson sings about in one of his many famous songs and look into that glass coated with metal amalgam in order to see the 'man in the mirror'. Nghimtina is in charge of a ministry that is tasked with executing the government's public works. This year his ministry alone will preside over the spending of nearly N$6 billion. If you add parastatals under his care, the value easily passes N$10 billion and that's no small change for a country that needs every penny to boost its development opportunities. Any waste, through fraud, mismanagement and other forms of corruption, should thus not be tolerated. If the latest reports published in this newspaper do not spur Nghimtina into decisive action then he must accept that inaction is tantamount (deliberately or inadvertently) to helping the acts of mismanagement and corruption. The Namibian understands that at least four people at the airports company are being threatened with losing their jobs. Their crime? They dared to question an order to implement a project that cost the company [read government] twice the amount more than it is necessary and which contract was awarded despite the best possible advice of the technical staff. The NAC has an acting CEO because they fired the previous one for questioning the way directors spend the parastatal's money. They paid more than N$2 million to Ben Biwa and are most likely to fire and pay the staff who are questioning the current round of dubious deals, too. Why award the security cameras contract at two of Windhoek's airports to Syntex for N$15.2m, when Schoemans, the company which the NAC tender committee rated as having technically the best offer, came in at N$7.7m? Even more questionable in this saga, is email correspondence by one of the employees telling directors that the recommendations of the evaluator were ""modified to favour Syntex as per the tender committee resolution"". Then there's another 'aha', if you consider that the board of directors last year did away with having management to do the leg work in big tenders and instead set up a tender committee comprised of the board of directors itself. Similar to the security cameras issue is a N$50m contract for airport scanners (not to be confused with the ones of the Ministry of Finance with Teko Trading of Teckla Lameck-Kongo Mokaxwa). Our information is that this contract was awarded to someone who does not meet the government requirements. Yet both of these are being pushed through and the people who question them are being persecuted. It's an old modus operandi. Two years ago, NAC hired one Brian Nalisa to 'restructure' the company. (Dozens of workers lost their jobs.) Nalisa walked away with N$7.5m for the five-month hatchet job. In one instance he allegedly charged the NAC N$400 000 for a 10-minute call to the Labour Commissioner. Two directors have been in charge throughout these shenanigans: Ndeuhala Katonyala and Frieda Aluteni. They have themselves been accused of milking the NAC by literally acting like full-time employees of NAC. Other directors have either resigned in disgust or have been sidelined and thus hounded out of the NAC the same way as happened to senior managers who are believed to have crossed Katonyala and Aluteni's paths. Nghimtina has been accused before of failing to act against the two. As recently as 2012 he sat on a report that recommended that he immediately fire the NAC directors because of allegations of mismanagement and fraud. But Katonyala and Aluteni have survived throughout. The latest reports surely must give Nghimtina new cause for decisive action. He should take a leaf from his Cabinet colleagues, such as Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, Doreen Sioka, who fired the board when she believed commissioners at the Social Security Commission acted beyond their duty and outside the bounds of good governance. If he does nothing he will be viewed, correctly, as aiding corruption and the abuse of State resources. He should rather heed the advice of the departed superstar who sang: ""I'm Gonna Make A Change; For Once In My Life; It's Gonna Feel Real Good; Gonna Make A Difference; Gonna Make It Right"". Go on, tate Erkki Nghimtina. Make that change."540,The Namibian (Windhoek),4/22/14,Majority of Businesses View Corruption As a Risk,,NAMIBIA (94%),Newspaper,Chamwe Kaira,ENGLISH,22-Apr-14,,344 words,"POLLS & SURVEYS (92%); BRIBERY (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); RISK MANAGEMENT (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); CRIME PREVENTION (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); MISAPPROPRIATION (78%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (73%) Namibia; Corruption; Economy, Business and Finance","THE latest Ernst & Young-Namibian Fraud & Corruption Landscape Survey shows that 79% of Namibian businesses view fraud and corruption as a big risk. Executive management and risk management staff of 90 Namibian companies were surveyed for their views on fraud, bribery and corruption in Namibia and their efforts to mitigate these risks. ""The percentage of respondents that view fraud and corruption as a big risk to their businesses, together with the indication that 76% suffered incidents of fraud and corruption in the last three years and 64% feel that their businesses are not adequately protected against fraud and corruption underscores the key conclusion of the survey,"" said Hans Hashagen, Partner for Fraud Investigation and Dispute Services for Ernst & Young Namibia. According to the survey, the most prevalent schemes in Namibia are asset misappropriation, procurement and tender fraud and corruption and bribery. Respondents further indicated that procurement, cash and stock are the most vulnerable areas in their businesses. The survey results showed 27% of respondents indicated that they have been requested to pay bribes in the course of doing business in Namibia while 58% indicated that they are aware that bribes are being paid in their industry. Respondents reported 2 776 incidents of fraud and corruption over the last three years. The survey showed that 51% of respondents indicated that they do not have pro-active fraud risk management programme in place. ""Practical steps that businesses can take to prevent fraud and corruption includes educating their management and employees on what fraud and corruption are and how to identify the red flags that could indicate that fraud and corruption are taking place in your business,"" the report said. Ernst & Young said appropriate fraud prevention policies and a tone of zero tolerance from top management is very important. In addition, an anonymous reporting mechanisms and regular fraud risk assessments go a long way in empowering businesses in the fight against fraud and corruption,"" it said."553,The Namibian (Windhoek),5/22/14,Traffic Cop Convicted of Corruption,,NAMIBIA (94%),Newspaper,Adam Hartman,ENGLISH,22-May-14,,286 words,CORRUPTION (93%); VERDICTS (90%); BRIBERY (90%); MAGISTRATES (90%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (90%); FINES & PENALTIES (90%); SENTENCING (90%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (90%); ARRESTS (90%); POLICE FORCES (78%); ARREST WARRANTS (78%); JAIL SENTENCING (77%); CORRECTIONS (77%); PRISONS (77%); EVIDENCE (77%); LITIGATION (77%); EMERGENCY VEHICLES (73%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"A VETERAN police officer attached to the Erongo traffic department, Constable Johannes Geiseb (50), who was nominated as the traffic officer of the year in 2009, was found guilty of corruption in the Swakopmund Magistrate's Court last Thursday. Magistrate Gaynor Poulton sentenced Geiseb to a N$15 000 fine or two years in prison. In addition, he was sentenced to one year imprisonment, which was suspended for five years on condition that he is not convicted of corruptly using his office or position for gratification or of any other offence of which corruption is an element during the period of suspension. Two other charges under the Anti-Corruption Act pertaining to alleged bribery and obstructing a police officer performing his duty were withdrawn against him because of lack of evidence. Geiseb paid the fine. The Namibian understands that police Inspector General Lieutenant General Sebastian Ndeitunga has been informed about the outcome of Geiseb's court case and that an internal police board of inquiry will be instituted to determine his fate in the force. Geiseb had been in the traffic division for nearly a decade and was arrested at Swakopmund in February last year after he solicited a bribe of N$1 000 from a local resident, Heidi Jantjies. He was supposed to execute a warrant of arrest on Jantjies, who had allegedly failed to pay a N$2 000 traffic fine. When he went to Jantjies' home, Geiseb suggested that she could pay him an equivalent of half the fine to avoid arrest. At the time, Geiseb was wearing his police uniform and driving a police vehicle. Jantjies reported the matter and Geiseb was arrested by ACC officials and the police shortly afterwards. The bribe money was recovered from him."559,The Namibian (Windhoek),6/20/14,How About 'Good' Corruption?,,NAMIBIA (95%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,20-Jun-14,,795 words,CORRUPTION (90%); ETHICS (89%); CONTRACT AWARDS (89%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (89%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (89%); SEDANS (78%); ENTREPRENEURSHIP (77%); RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION (77%); MOTOR VEHICLES (73%); CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTING (58%); GENETIC ENGINEERING (50%) Namibia; Corruption,"PHOTOGRAPHS are circulating on social networks in Namibia of a Bentley (a British-origin luxury sedan that retails at no less than N$2million)allegedly owned by Collin Venaani. The Bentley's arrival on Namibian soil coincided with Venaani getting one of the lucrative National Housing Enterprise (NHE) mass housing scheme contracts under shady circumstances. Similar reports abound of other mass housing tenderpreneurs who have gone on shopping sprees of consumer goods (TV screens worth N$100 000) on the promise of receiving some of the NHE largesse. The word tenderpreneur was coined in South Africa to reconcile the differences between those calling themselves entrepreneurs and those who the public see as parasites feeding on public jobs. The government's handling of the mass housing scheme, a N$47 billion plan allegedly aimed at building houses for the poor, is fast proving that corruption in Namibia has reached alarming proportions. It is about time the scourge is tackled from different angles. For this uncompromising anti-corruption campaigner, it has even come to a point where we begin to entertain debates as to whether there's something like 'good' corruption. When things get really bad, as corruption has in this country, people tend to entertain oxymorons like ""good corruption"" as a way out of a deficient situation and to avoid throwing the baby out with the bathwater. For example, empowerment of those who need it is good, but giving money to the greedy to, supposedly, save the poor is a huge mistake. The worry therefore is that the ruling elite in both government and business tends to limit corruption to a legalistic environment. President Hifikepunye Pohamba's defence that he had nothing to do with the NHE awarding a contract for the building of houses to his daughter, who is in partnership with the daughter of a respected business leader, Johannes !Gawaxab, is a case in point. Not only do the President's henchmen argue that he did not know, but also insists that Kaupumhote Pohamba and Taschiona !Gawaxab are entitled to do business as they wish because they are adults. So, they are entitled to bid and win a government contract to build Pohamba's retirement home? Would the president let it be if he were to find out they got such a tender? The list of those NHE tender beneficiaries as well as of most government contracts show that the relatives of the ruling elite (Venaani, Ekandjo, Hailulu's in-law) and their closest friends are ""winning"" them effortlessly. Nothing wrong? Morality and ethics don't seem to matter with our ruling elite. But it is moral values and ethics, supported by laws, which mould societies. Right and wrong cannot simply be regulated by laws. State House's defense is akin to genetically modifying the seeds of corruption and making it resistant against good values and ethics. Propping up a class of so-called business people who are perpetual parasites of government contracts does not add long term value and does not create meaningful jobs. Nor will it empower Namibians to learn the intricacies of doing jobs that will build the country instead of passing them on to (often foreign) experts while we play boss. The term ""good corruption"" is often used in relation to the South Korean success from the 1960s, starting with the dictator Park Chung-hee. Park is credited with ""democratising corruption"" by rewarding people and companies with good government contracts as long as they supported his party. They allegedly did not use state power to benefit either the political elite or personal friends. They reportedly also made sure to clamp down on self-enrichment of officials and busi- ness leaders. More importantly, Park and his successors reportedly rewarded those who kept resources in the country and improved Korean skills (the best form of empowerment). South Korea has since outstrippedAfrican countries that were better at the time. Despite the benefit of learning from those before us, we are seeing the opposite. Corruption is getting worse and is hampering economic growth for the majority. Our national statistics show how the gaps in income have been growing between a few rich and the many poor Namibians. Small firms, whereby professionals and unskilled individuals set up real SMEs that are the growth-engines of any economy, hardly get the support they need. What we see instead is the few political elite, their relatives and friends, running companies while they themselves are employed elsewhere in government or the corporate sector without putting their regular income on the line or learning in order to develop the country. The state we are in is dire, but we still have an opportunity to turn our backs on the most despicable forms of corruption rather than defend the indefensible."561,The Namibian (Windhoek),7/4/14,Five Accused of Corruption At Youth Ministry,,NAMIBIA (93%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,4-Jul-14,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (72%)",450 words,CORRUPTION (92%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); MAGISTRATES (89%); ARRESTS (89%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (78%); BAIL (78%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (78%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (77%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (70%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Children and Youth,"THE Anti-Corruption Commission arrested two men on Wednesday for allegedly defrauding the Ministry of Youth, National Service, Sport and Culture of N$178 000. In a press release issued yesterday, ACC spokesperson Albert Mbanga said one of the two suspects, Daniel Amaambo (29), is employed as a clerical assistant at the ministry, while the other, house musician Simon Mekondjo Nehoya (30), is the owner of the company Acro-Tech. Nehoya, who is also known as Cox, and Amaambo appeared in the Windhoek Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. They were denied bail and their case was postponed to 16 July for further investigations to be carried out. The two men are charged with corruptly using an office or position for gratification, in contravention of the Anti-Corruption Act. According to the ACC, Amaambo is accused of having certified payments for fictitious services or goods delivered to the ministry. Mbanga said bank records show that Nehoya had deposited cheques into an account from which the money was then withdrawn after he had asked for special clearance of the cheques. It was discovered during the ACC's investigation that another suspect, Joseph Haita, who was employed in the ministry's finance department, had been involved in the processing of a payment of N$178 000 allegedly made to Nehoya's company, Mbanga indicated. Haita has also been charged with corruptly using an office or position for gratification. He made a first appearance in the Windhoek Magistrate's Court in December last year and remained in custody until the bail that had been granted to him earlier was reduced to N$8 000 on 22 May. With the arrest and court appearance of Amaambo and Nehoya the number of people facing charges in connection with payments made by the Ministry of Youth, National Service, Sport and Culture for goods and services never delivered to it has risen to five. The first two people charged in the case in December last year were Edward Hategekimana and Alfred Ortmann, court records indicate. With their first court appearance a public prosecutor told the presiding magistrate that the charge against Hategekimana involved a payment of close to N$690 000 for services and goods that were not delivered, while the charge against Ortmann involved an amount of almost N$178 000. The ACC has investigated a number of cases of fraud and corruption involving payments for fictitious services or goods supposedly delivered to the ministry, said Mbanga. He appealed to officials of the ministry or concerned members of the public to report any suspicious tender awarded for the delivery of goods or services to the ministry to the ACC for investigation. Whistle-blowers' identity would be protected, he said."567,The Namibian (Windhoek),7/25/14,Anti-Corruption Commission - Is It the Car or the Driver?,,NAMIBIA (92%),Newspaper,Alexactus T Kaure,ENGLISH,25-Jul-14,,807 words,CORRUPTION (90%); APPOINTMENTS (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (77%); BOARD CHANGES (76%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (74%); INVESTIGATIONS (73%); WEALTHY PEOPLE (50%) Namibia; Corruption,"WHEN one reads screaming headlines like ""Nghimtina under probe"", then one thinks the ACC is up to its mission. But like in so many other cases they suddenly go cold. Are we losing the fight against corruption then? If the answer is yes, what is the problem? The recurrent criticism of the ACC is that it has hopelessly failed to deal with high profile cases, giving the impression (perhaps wrongly) that the director and the deputy have feet of clay. The simple question is: do we have the necessary and sufficient structures in place to fight corruption in Namibia? But why ask the question, some might wonder, since we already have a statutory body created by an act of parliament to do precisely that. Yes, we do but was the commission properly configured? Is it built on a solid foundation? I'm not a structuralist but in this case I have to make use of its principles to argue that the commission was from the outset not properly structured. Yes, we created a commission but then we forgot to appoint the commissioners. It is thus a commission without commissioners. Instead we appointed a director and a deputy as if we were setting up a directorate. And this is where the problems started - it was a design flaw. Some might even say: plus the driver's error. I recall that the initial reaction, reservation and perhaps skepticism about the appointment of Paulus Noa and his deputy, Erna van der Merwe, was that the two were neither high-profile figures nor known anti-corruption fighters. But, of course, the selection panel and later the authority felt that these were the best candidates to run the daunting task of the commission. It must have been a job that no one was particularly interested in. In some countries high-profile jobs like this one require that those who apply must reveal their credentials for public scrutiny - but not so in our case. Don't get me wrong here. I'm by no means questioning the qualifications of the two directors as lawyers. The point I'm raising is that this body is in need of redefinition and reconfiguration if we are serious about fighting corruption in this country. The unfortunate thing is that no one thought about (fighting) corruption for the good part of our existence as an independent nation. Commissions of inquiry were set up to probe corrupt cases in government and the parastatals but not much came out of those. This meant that for a good 15 years Namibia was a 'corruption paradise' - creating a few instant millionaires while the 'wretched of the earth' looked on in bewilderment. As it is now, corruption in Namibia reminds one of an Indian folk tale about the four blind men who are led to an elephant. Each of them is positioned at a different part of the animal. One feels the elephant leg, the other the tail, the third an ear and the last one the body. And as a result of their tactile encounter each in turn describes what he has felt as a log, a rope, a fern and a wall. Corruption in Namibia is like that elephant - it has taken root and spread its tentacles rather widely and I don't think that one person and his deputy would be able to figure out what this animal really is. Well, some might argue that the commission has a number of investigators (drawn mainly from former police officers) and other support staff. That's fine. Some people have, however, questioned the competence of the investigators given the lacklustre performance of many officers in the Namibian Police Force even in dealing with the most mundane cases. The issue here is that the support staff has to report their findings to someone. That person is, of course, the director and the deputy who in turn have to make the final decision. And this is where the question of perception and interest comes in. I personally think that the appointment of two lawyers to lead the commission was an ill-thought and shortsighted move that is now in need of immediate review and rectification. This is not just a legal issue. In fact, I have never come across a textbook on law dealing comprehensively with corruption as they do in political science for example. Corruption affects the whole of social, economic and political life; thus calling for a more nuanced approach to eradicate it. Thus, we need a team of commissioners drawn from a plethora of disciplines and, yes, from a broad section of our population to reflect the diversity of our society. Such a commission would ideally have a rotating chairperson in order to avoid building a hierarchical structure. There is always a danger in vesting the power of such a commission in one person because he or she can easily override decisions taken at the lower level. Yet another problem with the current set-up is that the director has his own perception and world view and thus his definition of what constitute corruption. It's time we revisit this institution."579,The Namibian (Windhoek),10/13/14,Soldier to Pay for Corruption,,NAMIBIA (94%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,13-Oct-14,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (73%)",459 words,CORRUPTION (92%); MAGISTRATES (91%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (90%); SENTENCING (89%); TESTIMONY (89%); BRIBERY (77%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (76%); LAWYERS (75%) Namibia; Corruption,"A SCAM in which a Namibian Defence Force member used a promise of employment in the military to solicit payment from two people has landed him with a conviction on corruption charges and a fine of N$4 000. Magistrate John Sindano convicted the soldier, Alfeus Phillipus (32), in the Windhoek Magistrate's Court on Thursday on two counts of corruptly receiving gratification as an inducement. Although Phillipus pleaded not guilty to the charges last month, he ended up admitting last week that he solicited payments from two women by promising that he could arrange employment in the NDF for them, and that he then used the money for his own benefit. It was ""just a mistake"" that he made when he solicited the bribes, Phillipus told the magistrate. ""I do not know what came in my mind,"" he said. After finding Phillipus guilty on the two charges under the Anti-Corruption Act, Magistrate Sindano sentenced him to 12 months' imprisonment or a fine of N$4 000. The magistrate told Phillipus that it was regarded as aggravating that he targeted two vulnerable women who were trying to make ends meet, and that two years passed before he paid back the money that the two women had given to him under the illusion that he would arrange employment for them in the NDF. Each of the two women paid N$1 000 to Phillipus during the period of June to July 2012. The first woman, Esther Shepane, testified that she was selling kapana when Phillipus approached her with an offer that if she paid him N$3 000 he could get her employed in a vacant position at the NDF. After negotiating his asking price down to N$1 000, she managed to scrape money together by borrowing it from relatives, before she handed over N$1 000 to Phillipus, she said. When she contacted him again about two weeks later, having heard nothing from him in the meantime, he told her that the NDF needed more people that it could recruit, she said. She then told a friend about Phillipus, and her friend later also paid N$1 000 to him to supposedly secure employment in the NDF, Shepane said. The two women testified that they were told they would be employed as cleaners after they had paid the money to Phillipus. The employment never happened, though. They also told the court that in July this year, after they had been notified that they were required to testify in court, Phillipus paid back the money that each of them had given to him. With the sentencing Magistrate Sindano commented that the only reasonable inference he could draw was that Phillipus refunded the money, two years after he had received and used it, only when he realised that his trial would be proceeding after all. Phillipus was not represented by a defence lawyer during his trial. The prosecution was conducted by Henry Muhongo."583,The Namibian (Windhoek),10/24/14,Corruption Gets Defence Official Six Years in Jail,,NAMIBIA (93%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,24-Oct-14,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (73%)",506 words,CORRUPTION (91%); JAIL SENTENCING (90%); MAGISTRATES (90%); EMBEZZLEMENT (90%); CORRECTIONS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS (90%); ADMISSIONS & CONFESSIONS (89%); PRISONS (89%); SENTENCING (89%); MONEY LAUNDERING (89%); GUILTY PLEAS (89%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (89%); LITIGATION (78%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION (74%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (74%); NATURAL GAS & ELECTRIC UTILITIES (69%); REPOSSESSION (63%); CRIME PREVENTION (62%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"AN OFFICIAL in the Ministry of Defence has been sent to prison for six years after he admitted that he was involved in a corrupt scheme in which close to N$800 000 was embezzled from his employer. Magistrate Cosmos Endjala sentenced Sam Natangwe Shingenge in the Windhoek Magistrate's Court in Katutura after Shingenge pleaded guilty to two charges of corruptly using an office or position for gratification, two counts of corruptly using a false document, and one charge of money laundering. Shingenge admitted that he was employed in the ministry's construction and maintenance division, which has to verify and process invoices from the ministry's service providers for payment, when he used his position to create and submit two false invoices from electricity distributor Erongo RED to the ministry. That was done in August and September 2010. Based on the first invoice the ministry issued a cheque in an amount of N$302 598,19 to Erongo RED, while a cheque in an amount of N$495 929,53 was also issued to Erongo RED as a result of the second false invoice. The cheques were then deposited in a bank account of a company with the potentially misleading name E Red Electrical and Electrical Services. Suspicions that were raised after the second cheque had been deposited resulted in the placing of the amount of N$495 929 in a suspense account, with the effect that Shingenge could not get his hands on that money. Shingenge also admitted that an amount of N$60 000, which was part of the money received as a result of the first false invoice and the first cheque from the ministry, was used to buy a Volkswagen Golf GTI car in his name on 20 September 2010. By using the ill-gotten money in that way, he committed the crime of money laundering in terms of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act, he admitted. Shingenge was charged with three co-accused: Tobias Shaanika, Moses Vahongaifa, and Andreas Hekandjo. His trial was separated from theirs after they pleaded not guilty to the charges while he admitted guilt. During Shingenge's sentencing Magistrate Endjala said he was taking into account that Shingenge was a first-time offender and that he had pleaded guilty, which was regarded as a sign of repentance. The magistrate recounted that according to Shingenge he committed the crimes because he was experiencing financial difficulties and his house was due to be repossessed. However, the fact that Shingenge used some of the proceeds of his crimes to buy the Golf GTI could only lead to the conclusion that he embezzled the money to enrich himself, Magistrate Endjala said. He sentenced Shingenge to three years' imprisonment on the first two charges of corruptly using an office or position for gratification and corruptly using a false document. On the second set of similar charges, Shingenge was sentenced to a two-year prison term, while he was sentenced to an effective jail term of one year for money laundering.

Nghixulifwa and his co-accused - David Imbili, Hafeni Nghinamwaami, and Anna Ndoroma - were informed during a pre-trial appearance before Judge Christie Liebenberg that the dates reserved for the trial are from 21 September to 8 October 2015, then from 16 to 23 November, and then from 1 to 9 December. The four accused remain free on bail of N$60 000 each, which was granted to them after their arrest by the Anti-Corruption Commission in February this year. They were arrested following a decision by the prosecutor general to prosecute them and two companies, represented by Imbili and Nghinamwaami, in the High Court on eight charges. Four of the charges flow from the RCC's involvement in the B1 City property development project in 2005 and 2006. Other charges relate to Nghixulifwa's tenure as chief executive officer of the parastatal, which came to an end with his resignation at the end of 2006, after he had been suspended from his position. Nghixulifwa is set to face all eight of the charges, consisting of three main counts of corruptly using his office or position for gratification, two main counts of fraud, two main charges of failing to disclose his interest in a contract to the board of directors of the RCC, and a charge of using or concealing property obtained through corruption. Nghinamwaami and Ndoroma are charged with two main counts of corruptly using an office or position for gratification and further charges of fraud and using or concealing property obtained through corruption. Imbili and the company /Ae //Gams Engineering are charged with main counts of corruptly using an office or position for gratification and using or concealing property obtained through corruption. The prosecution is alleging that Nghixulifwa was a shareholder in both /Ae //Gams Engineering and the company Cradle Investments, but concealed his stake in the two companies by having his shares held in Ndoroma's name, and failed to disclose his interests in the two companies to the board of directors of the RCC. Nghinamwaami and Imbili were also shareholders of /Ae //Gams Engineering. The RCC became involved in the B1 City shopping complex and taxi rank development after Imbili, representing /Ae //Gams Engineering, and Nghixulifwa, representing the RCC, signed an agreement in February 2005 in terms of which the RCC and /Ae //Gams Engineering were to undertake the property development as a joint venture. The prosecution is charging that Nghixulifwa, Imbili, Nghinamwaami, Ndoroma and /Ae //Gams Engineering corruptly used Nghixulifwa's position at the RCC to buy the plot of land where the B1 City development was to take place on behalf of /Ae //Gams Engineering, using RCC funds and a credit facility in an amount of N$4,87 million. Nghixulifwa allegedly also defrauded the RCC by bringing managers at the parastatal and the chairperson of the RCC board under the impression that a mortgage bond of N$4,87 million had been registered over the B1 City property in RCC's favour, when in fact that had not been done. The State is further alleging that Nghixulifwa defrauded the RCC and a construction company, Murray & Roberts, in December 2004 by concealing his shareholding in Cradle Investments and inducing the RCC and Murray & Roberts to pay a 'facilitation fee' of N$150 000 to the company and Nghinamwaami for the role they had supposedly played in the construction of a new head office for the RCC. It is alleged that in fact Nghinamwaami and Cradle Investments had not been appointed as project facilitators and were not entitled to receive such a fee. In pre-trial documents filed with the court the four accused have indicated that they would plead not guilty on all charges."586,The Namibian (Windhoek),10/31/14,Airports Boss in Corruption Probe,,NAMIBIA (96%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,31-Oct-14,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (73%)",917 words,INVESTIGATIONS (92%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (92%); CORRUPTION (92%); AIRPORT OPERATION (90%); ELECTRONIC MAIL (85%); LAYOFFS (78%); AIRPORTS (78%); WITNESSES (78%); CONTRACT AWARDS (77%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (77%); CRIMINAL LAW (77%); SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY (72%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (71%); EXECUTIVES (69%); SEVERANCE PAY (64%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE boss of the Namibia Airports Company, Tamer El-Kallawi (pictured), is a suspect in an investigation by the country's Anti-Corruption Commission relating to irregularities in a major CCTV contract at four airports, amaBhungane has learned. Prosecutor General Martha Imalwa confirmed that she had received a docket from the ACC and has examined it. She however declined to reveal whether she would prosecute, saying those affected need to be informed first. AmaBhungane has seen a copy of a letter from the anti-graft commission, dated 9 June, informing the chairperson of the NAC board, Ndeuhala Katonyala, that El-Kallawi, the airports company's acting chief executive, is under investigation in connection with a CCTV tender awarded to Syntex Technology. ""I refer to your letter dated 20 May 2014. I have since established that Tamer El-Kallawi is a suspect in the allegations against the NAC, which are currently under investigation by the [commission],"" the letter states. The letter hints that potential witnesses in the matter had been subjected to disciplinary action and warns: ""The [Anti-corruption] Act [states] that any disciplinary hearing, civil or criminal proceedings by any other person or authority against any informer or person who assisted the commission into the alleged suspect investigations is committing an offence against the law."" The Namibian previously reported that certain NAC officials refused to implement the Syntex tender because of irregularities. The officials subsequently fell victim to a restructuring process - one was demoted, another took a retrenchment package and yet another is on suspension. The investigation came after the NAC awarded to Syntex the CCTV tender for N$15,2 million - double the amount quoted by a rival bidder, Schoemann Technologies, which also scored the highest points allocated by the evaluation committee. Emails previously seen by The Namibian indicate that a staff member tasked with evaluating the tender committee's recommendations ""modified [them] to favour Syntex"". Schoemann took the NAC to court and won an unopposed interdict in the Windhoek High Court to stop the implementation of the tender award earlier this year. The Anti-Corruption Commission's director, Paulus Noa, said the investigation had been concluded and -recommendations sent to the prosecutor-general for a final decision. He declined to provide further details. NAC board chairperson Katonyala refused to comment: ""What do you want? Kindly never call me again, please."" Asked whether he knew that he was a suspect, El-Kallawi said: ""I do not care about what you want to ask. I do not want to know and even if you e-mail me, I will not respond."" Messages sent to his e-mail account and to the NAC's spokesperson Dan Kamati went unanswered. The tender will see the installation of surveillance cameras at Windhoek's Hosea Kutako International Airport, as well as at the Walvis Bay, Eros and Ondangwa airports. The deal caught the attention of the anti-corruption commission after e-mails emerged from NAC official Courage Silombela, addressed to the NAC board, in which he stated that he has altered the comments made to favour Syntex ""as per [the] tender committee resolution"". There have been claims that Syntex's owner Linus Amulungu is close to board chairperson Katonyala. Katonyala denied having a close relationship with Amulungu and said they were merely acquaintances. Amulungu told amaBhungane this week: ""We were not the only highest bidders; there were others too. At this point, we are just waiting and we rest our case. If they call us back to implement the tender we will. But business has to go on; there are other things to take care of."" The CCTV tender sparked an up-roar in the airports company in March this year, when senior staff members refused to implement it because of the way it was awarded. They included the general manager of operations, Gerson Katjangua, who, according to sources, took a severance package, and senior manager for quality assurance Titus Shuungula, who was to be transferred to the Keetmanshoop airport. Another senior official, Mia Davids, was demoted from the post of head of corporate communications to corporate communications officer, while the NAC manager for procurement, Mwangi wa Kamau, is still on suspension. At the time, NAC spokesperson Kamati described the developments as ""a realignment in accordance with the company's strategic plan"". AmaBhungane understands that Davids is fighting her demotion in the labour court, while Katjangua has since left the NAC. Katjangua, Shuungula and Davids refused to comment. El-Kallawi called for an urgent workshop in July, which all managerial staff were required to attend, where the subject was the restructuring of posts for certain individuals. The NAC leadership has also come under fire over the downgrading of the Hosea Kutako International Airport by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) following an audit in July. It was downgraded from category nine to five after the airport's rescue and firefighting services were found not adequate for the take-off and landing of the Airbus 330. The ICAO found that there were not enough trained firefighters and that the fire truck was not functional. Although the airports company had planned to upgrade Namibia's airports in accordance with a five-year strategic plan, it failed to do so in time for the audit.

Nghimtina was being investigated on corruption allegations that he awarded mining rights in exchange for kickbacks to oil exploration millionaire Knowledge Katti. Other allegations pertained to his relationship with businessman Elmo Kaiyamo, who runs a roads construction company, OTESA Civil Engineering. Nghimtina allegedly advised Kaiyamo to resign his post as a Roads Contractor Company manager to form OTESA, in which the minister allegedly has an interest. ""The ACC could not find evidence implicating minister Erkki Nghimtina in unlawful tender deals,"" read the statement issued by the ACC yesterday. In the statement, the ACC also said it made efforts to obtain all the information possible including statements under oath from potential witnesses. It said it could not find any evidence or information implicating Nghimtina in unlawful tender deals with Kaiyamo, and that it could not find information or evidence to substantiate allegations that Nghimtina, as mines and energy minister, awarded EPLs and mining rights to Katti. The ACC further said that no person came forward to inform them about the alleged shares Nghimtina received under the table. ""In the absence of evidence implicating the suspects, ACC concludes that the allegations against Minister Nghimtina, Elmo Kaiyamo and Knowledge Katti are baseless and lack substance,"" concluded the statement. Nghimtina's relationship with the businessmen has been the subject of media reports over the years. The Namibian has also, this year, written about the ACC's investigations into Nghimtina, with the minister's bank accounts also being inspected."598,The Namibian (Windhoek),12/11/14,ACC Records Decline in Corruption Cases,,NAMIBIA (97%); AFRICA (78%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,11-Dec-14,,380 words,CORRUPTION (95%); INVESTIGATIONS (91%); ANNUAL REPORTS (90%); POLLS & SURVEYS (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); ANNIVERSARIES (64%); HOTELS & MOTELS (63%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THERE has been a reduction in the number of reports of alleged corrupt practices in Namibia last year when 435 cases were recorded. This is according to the recently released annual report of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC). After the 2008/2009 financial year there was a reduction in the number of reported cases. However, during the 2011/2012 financial year, the number picked up again but dropped during the 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 with 20% and 29%, respectively. Off the 435 reports, 194 were closed as authorisation to investigate was declined, while 60 were referred to relevant institutions. Twenty-one cases were referred with a request for feedback and 10 other claims were regarded as unfounded after investigations, while investigations into 34 more cases could not prove any wrong-doing. Furthermore, the report indicates that investigations are ongoing for 56 cases with 22 cases in court and 23 awaiting the Prosecutor General's decision. The PG, however, declined to prosecute in nine cases. Contrary to this decline, Afrobarometer findings on corruption show that most respondents are of the opinion that corruption has increased over the past year and government is not handling the problem well. ""Close to two-thirds (63%) of Namibians believe that corruption in Namibia has increased over the past year,"" said Bill Lindeke, coordinator of the Afrobarometer Survey. The results further indicated, that on an average, a fifth of Namibians see widespread corruption in most institutions. The Afrobarometer Survey results were released as the World commemorated its 11th Anniversary of International Anti-Corruption Day, yesterday at the Hilton Hotel under the theme, 'Break the Corruption Chain.' In addition, survey results also indicate that police and government officials are seen as the most corrupt. About 40% of the reports received by the ACC are from the Khomas region. Lastly, deputy director of the ACC Erna van der Merwe said that while fighting corruption should be a top priority for government, it is also a personal responsibility. According to research by Transparency International Corruption Index 2014, Namibia is ranked 55th in the world and fifth in Africa in terms of perceived corruption in the public sector on a list of least corrupt countries."606,The Namibian (Windhoek),1/21/15,Swapo Parly Candidate Convicted of Corruption,,NAMIBIA (95%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,21-Jan-15,,418 words,CORRUPTION (92%); ELECTIONS (90%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (90%); FINES & PENALTIES (89%); SENTENCING (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); RESIGNATIONS (87%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (78%); VERDICTS (78%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (73%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (72%); CIVIL SERVICES (64%); GOVERNMENT GRANTS & SUBSIDIES (50%) Namibia; Corruption; Governance,"ONE of the ruling Swapo Party's members who was elected to the National Assembly has left her career chances hanging in the balance after she was convicted of corruption shortly before the elections in November last year. Rundu-based Marina Kandumbu, who is number 70 on the Swapo Party list of 77 candidates going to the National Assembly was charged and convicted of a case of corruption. Swapo secretary-general Nangolo Mbumba yesterday confirmed that the party was investigating and verifying details of Kandumbu's conviction before it can decide on the course of the action to take. Mbumba said that party policy dictates that convicted persons do not qualify to get onto the party list. He, however, said that Kandumbu was convicted after the party had held its electoral college. ""If she was really convicted, it is unfortunate,"" Mbumba said, adding that the party's policies are ""very clear"" on such issues. Furthermore, Mbumba said Swapo also upholds judgements handed down by traditional courts. Kandumbu yesterday said she was unaware of the party's probe and that she did not receive any communication from the party head office or from Mbumba. She said she could not comment on or confirm the conviction. An inquiry by The Namibian revealed that Kandumbu was convicted on 11 November last year at Rundu. She was charged under the Anti-Corruption Act for allegedly using her position in government for personal gratification. The case, with number 143/2011, had dragged on for four years before it was concluded. The charges originate from her allegedly renting out a government subsidised house. Magistrate Helen Olaiya found Kandumbu guilty and sentenced her to five years imprisonment or a fine of N$100 000. Four years or N$90 000 was suspended and she ended up paying a N$10 000 fine. The sentence was suspended on condition that Kandumbu repays the Ministry of Education N$87 887 in 31 instalments from 27 November last year to May or June 2017. Part of the suspended sentence was a condition that she is not convicted of crimes under the Anti-Corruption Act for the period of five years. Kandumbu was employed as an education planner for the Ministry of Education in the Kavango East region. It is not clear if she has already resigned her position as per the public service law which deems civil servants who are elected to parliament as having resigned as soon as election results are announced and they have secured a seat. Kandumbu refused to comment on whether she had resigned from the public service."610,The Namibian (Windhoek),1/28/15,Namwandi Cleared of Corruption,,NAMIBIA (94%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,28-Jan-15,,341 words,CORRUPTION (91%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (91%); CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); ACCREDITATION (78%); PRIVATE SCHOOLS (78%); STUDENT FINANCIAL AID (78%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (78%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (77%); STUDENT LOANS (77%); UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION (77%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (73%); APPOINTMENTS (73%); RESIGNATIONS (72%) Namibia; Corruption,"THE Anti-Corruption Commission of Namibia on Monday cleared Minister of Education David Namwandi of corruption. Media reports last year insinuated that Namwandi had used his ministerial position to influence the appropriation of loans to students at the International University of Management (IUM), an institution he founded. Namwandi had requested the ACC to carry out an investigation in order to put the case to bed, which found that he had in fact resigned from his position as the vice chancellor of the university when he was appointed deputy education minister to avoid a conflict of interests. Virginia Namwandi is the vice chancellor of IUM. Namwandi had also requested the ministry to stop funding IUM but the ministry only did so in 2013. The ACC also found that the education ministry had been paying rental fees to IUM since 2006 as part of the ministry's subsidy assistance to private schools and institutions. The university was granted the subsidy because at the time it was the only private institution of higher learning offering courses accredited by the Namibia Qualifications Authority (NQA) Board and it was also facing threats of eviction from its rented premises. It was however found that Vitalis Ankama, who was the permanent secretary at the ministry then failed to comply with the Treasury requirements as he did not seek authorisation before the ministry gave financial assistance to IUM. ""His decision constituted unauthorised expenditure making him liable for disciplinary action if he was still employed in public service. His decision cannot be attributed to IUM,"" read the statement. Ankama said it was unfortunate that he had been found not to have complied with Treasury requirements at the time, ""It was probably an oversight. I signed for the submission documents after it was certain that all requirements had been carried out. It is just unfortunate that it happened,"" he said. Namwandi said he had not yet been fully informed of the ACC findings as he had been out of office. ""It is a no comment for now,"" he said."614,The Namibian (Windhoek),2/13/15,Katzao Acquitted on Corruption Charges,,NAMIBIA (95%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,13-Feb-15,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (73%)",710 words,SUBPOENAS (91%); MAGISTRATES (91%); CORRUPTION (91%); TESTIMONY (91%); ACQUITTAL (90%); WITNESSES (90%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (90%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (89%); HOLDING COMPANIES (89%); BRIBERY (89%); EVIDENCE (78%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (78%); APPOINTMENTS (78%); LAWYERS (75%); EMPLOYEE PROMOTIONS (73%); HEARSAY (73%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (73%); EXECUTIVE MOVES (66%); PRINTING INDUSTRY (63%); RESIGNATIONS (62%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE absence of crucial witnesses who were supposed to testify in the corruption trial of a former senior manager in the Trustco group, Stanley Katzao has resulted in his discharge on all counts he was facing in the Windhoek Magistrate's Court in Katutura on Wednesday. Magistrate Cosmos Endjala pronounced Katzao not guilty on six main counts under the Anti-Corruption Act and various alternative charges after he refused to postpone Katzao's trial again to give the prosecution more time to secure the presence of the witnesses who were still to testify in the trial. The magistrate was told that the witnesses, who were supposed to travel from outside Namibia to testify, had not been subpoenaed to appear in the court. It is understood that subpoenas that were supposed to be sent to foreign governments in order to be served on the witnesses outside Namibia were not dispatched due to a slip-up at the Ministry of Justice. With Katzao's defence lawyer, Sisa Namandje, opposing public prosecutor Veiko Alexander's request for a postponement of the trial, which started in September 2013, Magistrate Endjala ruled in favour of the defence and refused to grant a further postponement. The effect of that ruling is that the prosecution's case against Katzao was deemed to have been closed. Namandje then asked the magistrate to discharge Katzao at the end of the State's case, and that application also succeeded. Without the testimony of the witnesses who were still due to testify, much of the previous testimony heard by the magistrate constitutes hearsay evidence. Katzao pleaded not guilty to all charges at the start of his trial. The prosecution alleged that on various dates during 2006 he solicited kickbacks from two foreign companies that supplied a printing machine and paper to a printing company that was partly owned by Trustco, where Katzao was employed in a senior post at the time. Katzao was later promoted to the position of managing director of Legal Shield Holdings, before he was suspended in November 2006, after allegations that he had solicited kickbacks for his own benefit had surfaced. Katzao resigned from his job in the Trustco group in February 2007, while disciplinary charges against him were still pending. Criminal charges followed later. In those charges, the prosecution alleged that Katzao solicited a kickback from the German company Globalsource GmbH in April and May 2006 by requesting to be paid US$35 for each tonne of paper that the company was to supply to the company Free Press Printers, in which Trustco and The Namibian were joint partners. The State also alleged that between November 2005 and August 2006 Katzao solicited kickbacks from a British company, Grafitec Web Limited, which sold a printing machine to Free Press Printers. The prosecution charged that Katzao received kickbacks totalling N$131 120 from Grafitec Web Limited. Two foreign witnesses who were still supposed to testify in the trial were employed with the German and British companies at the time the offences were allegedly committed. Namandje stated during the trial that his client was denying having requested anybody to pay a kickback to him, while he was also denying having received any such payments. A former colleague of Katzao in the Trustco group, Jan Jones, testified during the trial that an employee of Globalsource GmbH, Patrick Brennan, had told him during a meeting in November 2006 that he was uncomfortable about working with Katzao, because Katzao was asking him to make payments to him for each tonne of paper that the printing company was buying from Globalsource. A transcript of a recorded telephone conversation between Katzao and Brennan in May 2006 was part of the evidence placed before the magistrate. No direct reference to any payments for Katzao's benefit was made in that conversation. Jones claimed the matter of kickbacks was referred to when Brennan told Katzao, after they had discussed the price that the printing company was to pay for paper supplied to it: ""OK and regarding the other thing that we discussed that's all been taken care of in this price as well."" ""OK. All right,"" was Katzao's response to that. Brennan is one of the witnesses whose absence from the court led to the refusal of a further postponement."641,The Namibian (Windhoek),4/21/15,Conradie Corruption Trial Delay Continues,,NAMIBIA (94%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,21-Apr-15,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (91%)",677 words,LAWYERS (92%); CORRUPTION (91%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (91%); BOARDS OF DIRECTORS (86%); MARKETING & ADVERTISING AGENCIES (85%); BUSINESS & CORPORATE ENTITIES LAW (78%); INDICTMENTS (78%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (78%); JURISDICTION (78%); LEGAL SERVICES (78%); JUDGES (78%); LITIGATION (78%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (77%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (77%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (69%); MARKETING & ADVERTISING (68%); TALKS & MEETINGS (62%); MOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES (50%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE start of the corruption trial of lawyer Dirk Conradie and a co-accused, Sara Damases, will be delayed until at least next week, after Damases was suddenly left without the services of a defence lawyer yesterday. With the trial of Conradie and Damases supposed to start before Acting Judge Thomas Masuku in the Windhoek High Court yesterday, South African senior counsel Vas Soni informed the judge that he did not think it was desirable that he should be representing Damases any longer. Soni indicated that he had come to that decision after he had gone through the material that the prosecution disclosed to the two accused to enable them to prepare for their trial. Soni will continue to represent Conradie, though. As a result of the end of Soni's representation of Damases, she would need time to instruct another lawyer to represent her during the trial. The case was postponed to Monday next week to give Damases time to arrange her legal representation. The trial was scheduled to begin on Thursday last week, but did not start after defence lawyer Slysken Makando asked Acting Judge Masuku to grant the defence a postponement until Thursday this week. The judge ruled on Friday that the case would be postponed only until yesterday. The dates for the trial were set in July last year. Conradie (55) and Damases (50) are jointly indicted on three charges under the Anti-Corruption Act, namely corruptly soliciting gratification for using influence in procuring a contract, corruptly using an office or position to obtain gratification, and attempting or conspiring to contravene sections of the Anti-Corruption Act. Conradie alone is also facing a fourth charge in terms of the Companies Act, namely failing to disclose an interest in a contract of significance to be entered into by a company. The prosecution is alleging that Conradie, who at that stage was the chairperson of the board of directors of cellphone company MTC, solicited or demanded gratification from the directors of an advertising company, DV8 Saatchi & Saatchi, during a meeting at the offices of his law firm, Conradie & Damaseb, in Windhoek on 12 June 2012. He allegedly did so by asking the advertising company's directors to agree to take Damases on board in their business as a black economic empowerment partner or in any other role, while promising that in return he would use his influence with the MTC board to ensure an advertising contract worth about N$60 million would be awarded to DV8. The two accused have indicated they would be pleading not guilty on all charges. They have in the meantime also given notice to the prosecution that they would be raising a special plea at the start of their trial. In the notice on the special plea, Makando is claiming that the High Court of Namibia does not have jurisdiction to try Conradie on the charge under the Companies Act, because it involves an offence that was allegedly committed at an MTC board meeting in Portugal on 19 June 2012 and a Namibian court does not have the jurisdiction to try Conradie for an alleged failure to fulfil a statutory duty outside Namibia. In respect of the charges under the Anti-Corruption Act, Makando gave notice that Conradie and Damases would be arguing that the prosecution's indictment is invalid because those three charges are based on evidence that, according to them, was obtained illegally, improperly and in violation of their constitutional rights to a fair trial, dignity, and the privacy of their communications. The argument of the two accused will be that evidence for the charges in terms of the Anti-Corruption Act was obtained surreptitiously, improperly and unlawfully, through recordings that were made of a confidential meeting between them and the directors of DV8 and of a telephone conversation between Damases and one of the company directors. They did not consent to the making of such recordings and the directors of the advertising company did not have the authority to make the recordings, Conradie and Damases will be claiming, according to the notice of the special plea."643,The Namibian (Windhoek),4/24/15,Corruption Accused Battle for Bail,,NAMIBIA (97%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,24-Apr-15,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (72%)",815 words,BAIL (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); ARRESTS (90%); TESTIMONY (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (88%); MAGISTRATES (78%); CONSPIRACY (78%); TAX LAW (76%); LAWYERS (73%); BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (69%); TAX ENFORCEMENT (69%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (69%); TAX AUDITS (60%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"TSUMEB-BASED businessman Karel ('Kallie') Grunschloss, who has spent the past two weeks in custody after being arrested on corruption charges, says he fears for the survival of his businesses and the employment of about 300 people unless he is granted bail. In a written statement that the leader of his team of defence lawyers, senior counsel Raymond Heathcote, read out in the Windhoek Magistrate's Court yesterday, Grunschloss expresses worry about the fate of his businesses if he had to remain in custody for an extended period. Grunschloss says in his statement he has businesses that are active all over Namibia, including in the transport of copper ore and the import and distribution of sugar in Namibia. He says he works seven days a week and travels thousands of kilometres around Namibia every month to run his businesses. It is simply impossible for the companies in his business group, in which about 300 people are directly employed, to be run successfully in his absence, he argues in his statement. He also says his businesses would most certainly suffer irreparable damages in his absence and his companies would be in jeopardy without his hands-on involvement. Considering those facts, it would be in the public interest to release him on bail, he is arguing. Grunschloss has chosen not to testify in person in support of his request to be granted bail. Through that choice, he has sidestepped the risk of having to field questions from the prosecution on the charges he is facing after his arrest by the Anti-Corruption Commission on 10 April. The only reference that he makes to the charges in his statement is an indication that he would be pleading not guilty to all charges. Grunschloss also says he would stand his trial as required, would comply with bail conditions, would not interfere with the investigation of his case - although the ACC's head of investigations, Nelius Becker, is charging that he has already interfered after his arrest - and is willing to pay N$1 million to be released on bail. Grunschloss and a Ministry of Finance tax investigator, Eustace Mujohn Mujohn, are charged with three counts in terms of the Anti-Corruption Act. They are accused of having conspired to commit offences under the Anti-Corruption Act, corruptly using a public office or position to obtain gratification, and using a false document with an intention to mislead people. ACC investigations chief Becker testified during the bail hearing yesterday that additional charges would definitely be added to the three counts as a result of evidence uncovered by ACC investigators over the past two weeks. The existing three charges are based on allegations that Grunschloss approached a Walvis Bay businessman during February and March with a claim that he had a senior contact in the Ministry of Finance's division responsible for tax audits and that he could help the businessman obtain favourable tax audit reports for his business in return for a payment of N$1 million. The coastal businessman approached the ACC as a whistle-blower, and more than a dozen conversations in which he and Grunschloss subsequently discussed Grunschloss' proposal were thereafter recorded, Becker has told the court. Grunschloss was arrested at a restaurant in Windhoek after he and the Walvis Bay businessman had a meeting during which Grunschloss showed him the supposed audit report that he could obtain for N$1 million. By the time they had that meeting, Grunschloss had already emailed to the whistle-blower a false invoice from one of his businesses, Logistix International, which was supposed to serve as a cover for the payment of N$1 million that he was allegedly soliciting. Becker has testified that the ACC gathered evidence from messages and names found on a second cellphone that Grunschloss had in his possession at the time of his arrest, as well as documents found in his car and a second cellphone that belonged to Mujohn. He said the evidence collected so far led to a conclusion that Mujohn was feeding Grunschloss with confidential information on tax audits carried out by the Ministry of Finance, which Grunschloss then used to try to extract payments from people. Following the arrest of Grunschloss and Mujohn, two people - the one is also a Walvis Bay-based businessman, and the other is the owner of a hunting farm in the Outjo district - have told the ACC that they, too, had been approached by Grunschloss with an offer that he could help them get favourable tax audit reports from the Ministry of Finance in return for substantial payments of money, Becker said. One of the people contacted the deputy director of the ACC to report Grunschloss' approach to him, during which a payment of N$1 million was allegedly also solicited, while the other has admitted that he paid a substantial amount of money in cash to Grunschloss, the court heard. The bail hearing is continuing today."645,The Namibian (Windhoek),4/28/15,Conradie Challenges Basis of Corruption Charges,,NAMIBIA (96%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,28-Apr-15,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (90%)",616 words,CORRUPTION (92%); LAWYERS (89%); JURISDICTION (89%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (89%); BOARDS OF DIRECTORS (86%); MARKETING & ADVERTISING AGENCIES (86%); BUSINESS & CORPORATE ENTITIES LAW (78%); INDICTMENTS (78%); LEGAL SERVICES (78%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (71%); MARKETING & ADVERTISING (69%); TALKS & MEETINGS (68%); MOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES (50%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE special plea through which lawyer Dirk Conradie and a co-accused, Sara Damases, are trying to get the corruption charges against themselves thrown out of court is due to be argued in the Windhoek High Court on Thursday next week. The date for the hearing of arguments on Damases and Conradie's special plea was set when they made a short appearance in the dock before Acting Judge Thomas Masuku yesterday. With their return to court a week after South African senior counsel Vas Soni informed Acting Judge Masuku that he would no longer be representing Damases, but would be leading only Conradie's defence team, Damases was represented by defence lawyer James Diedericks yesterday. Diedericks told the judge he would instruct a senior counsel to represent Damases with himself. Damases and Conradie's trial was scheduled to start on 16 April, but has been delayed by a defence request for a postponement, followed by Damases' loss of her legal representation. Conradie (55) and Damases (50) are jointly indicted on three charges under the Anti-Corruption Act, namely corruptly soliciting gratification for using influence in procuring a contract, corruptly using an office or position to obtain gratification, and attempting or conspiring to contravene sections of the Anti-Corruption Act.

In respect of the charges under the Anti-Corruption Act, Conradie and Damases argue in the special plea that evidence in support of those charges was obtained surreptitiously, improperly and unlawfully, through recordings that were made of a confidential meeting between themselves and the directors of DV8 and of a telephone conversation between Damases and one of the company directors. They did not consent to the making of such recordings and the directors of the advertising company did not have the authority to make the recordings, Conradie and Damases are stating in the notice of the special plea. They are claiming that if the special plea is upheld, it would dispose of the entire trial they are facing.

Labelle, a Canadian, was on Tuesday speaking on the last day of her two-day visit to Rwanda. She said the country's legal and institutional framework were delivering good results. ""I am pleased to see what is happening here. There are institutions in place which are essentially independent or at least perceived as such,"" she told journalists. Transparency International's report last year ranked Rwanda the least corrupt country in Africa and was among the top 50 best performing countries in the world out of 177 surveyed. For Labelle, Rwanda's legal framework which has anti-graft laws and its functional judiciary and police as well as oversight institutions like the Auditor General and the Ombudsman, have helped create an environment with very little corruption. She said other countries can learn from Rwanda's practices. Calling for the cooperation of Rwanda with other countries to fight corruption, the activist said one of the most challenging factors in the fight against the vice in the world today is the international nature of the crime. Given the current ease at which criminals move funds across borders using the internet, countries need to work together more than before, she advised. ""Looking forward, I think it is important for all countries to cooperate on issues of money laundering,"" the TI boss told The New Times in an exclusive interview. Labelle met and held talks with top government officials, including the Ombudsman, the Prosecutor General, the Inspector General of Police, and the Minister for Local Government. ""Reading and finding out about Rwanda, I think it has some strong institutions,"" she said. In a seeming reference to Imihigo, she also commended the government's efforts at helping people in communities around the country to organise themselves and work with their districts and other local governments to plan and deliver development programmes. Imihigo is a homegrown practice whereby a lower entity of administration works with the people on the ground to plan their development programmes and sign performance contracts with a higher authority, pledging to realise the goals set in the contracts."519,The New Times (Kigali),2/20/14,TI Boss Speaks About Rwanda's Fight Against Corruption [interview],,RWANDA (94%); AFRICA (93%),Newspaper,Eugene Kwibuka,ENGLISH,20-Feb-14,,1005 words,CORRUPTION (93%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (89%); BRIBERY (89%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (86%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (78%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (76%); RULE OF LAW (76%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (76%); POLICE FORCES (76%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (67%); WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION (54%) Rwanda; Corruption; International Organizations and Africa; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"A Transparency International report last year ranked Rwanda the least corrupt country in Africa and was among the top 50 best performing countries in the world out of 177 surveyed. The New Times' Eugene Kwibuka caught with Huguette Labelle, Chair of the Board of Transparency International, as she wrapped up her trip in the country on Tuesday. Police officers, judicial staff and lawyers march against corruption of Friday last week. Timothy Kisambira The first thing that all countries need is rule of law, a judiciary that is professional and provides justice to all people as well as a professional police force that carries out independent investigations. The justice system in Rwanda in functional and there are also other institutions like the Office of the Ombudsman where people can report anything wrong. There is also a law protecting whistle-blowers and a number of other laws. So, Rwanda's legal framework, judiciary, and oversight institutions like the Auditor General are all functional and I think other countries need to emulate this. Many countries do not have the institutions or have them but they are not strong or lack independence. It is important for the prosecutor and Ombudsman to be independent so that they can dispense justice professionally. Unfortunately, these are some of the things lacking in many countries around the world. Well, I think in many countries, the local traffic police is vulnerable to corruption even more than the police who investigate crime, for example. The other areas of vulnerability in any country are procurement and construction which happen a lot at the local level. So, I think all countries have to strengthen local governance because this is the level of government that people interact with daily. It's about access to health, education, justice, water, and being able to get a licence without having to bribe. I think strengthening capacity and integrity at all levels of government is important but we need to pay more attention to the local levels in all countries. There are many things that are important but one of them is to ensure that people hold public officials accountable. People need to know how money for healthcare, schools and roads etc is spent. The transparency of the flow of money all the way to the point of delivery is a very important aspect. The other aspect is to ensure proper procurement procedures. And the third one is to ensure that local governance units perform their duties in such a way that services are rendered to people without request for bribes. For example, ensuring that there is no cash transfer between the service delivery person and the person receiving the service. There are a number of other prescriptions but these are the most important. There is strong commitment at the top. There is zero tolerance for corruption right from the top down to the citizenry. As I said ealier, many countries have laws in place that are not implemented, and have regulations that are not enforced. The big issues are always about procurement, local government, transparency, enforcement, and implementation of laws and regulations. That's what is perceived. That zero tolerance to corruption has been promoted is very important in any country. This might be rather interesting but I would like to hear your thoughts. Well, that is his opinion. One of the things that Transparency International is interested in is for the people in communities to work closely with their local governments in the planning and delivery of programmes and on overseeing budgets and ensuring that there is no corruption at the time of procurement or construction. I think that the involvement of all the people of the community is very important and there is some work, of course, in this country in that regard. I think this brings people together and, of course, the state has played a very important role in upholding unity. I think all our countries have to strive towards that. There are divisions in many countries around the world and this is not a good recipe for success. If you live in a corrupt-free society or where there is little corruption, people feel safer and that's a question of security. It's a question of having better services for all, not just for a few. It's a question of seeing justice being made as opposed to injustice. But with corruption; you have lack of security, you have injustice, you have loss of money because some of the stolen money is sent to fiscal havens or outside the country. So, people see the money disappear but when you have the opposite, people are able to see that the resources of their country are used for the public good. There are many compelling reasons for countries around the world to fight corruption. Well, I have heard about that. But this kind of approach to life has destroyed countries around the world. You may get your material out of customs more quickly by putting money under the table but in the end you've just got the tips of your fingertips in the grinding machine and the rest of your body will go. The first time you pay a bribe you think that you are doing fine, you think that you are getting something but you should be getting that something anyway without having to pay a bribe. And by the time you've paid, you become a complicit to fraud and that other person that you bribed will expect more and more. That's how you lose money and if this becomes known when you are investigated and you are taken to court you lose your company sometimes, you go to prison as well, and you pay very hefty fines. Looking forward, I think it is important for all countries to fight money laundering and illicit trade. I know this is not a big issue in Rwanda but it can be in the future. Western countries-the G20 right now-have committed to cooperating in preventing money that has been stolen from being hidden in their countries. That whole area of stolen assets, money laundering, and illicit trade has to be taken very seriously by the whole world community because w can nolonger work in isolation."539,The New Times (Kigali),4/16/14,More Awareness On Corruption Law Will Help Curb the Vice,,RWANDA (79%),Newspaper,Sunny Ntayombya,ENGLISH,16-Apr-14,,665 words,CORRUPTION (92%); BRIBERY (89%); SCANDALS (78%); JAIL SENTENCING (73%); SENTENCING (73%); CORRECTIONS WORKERS (67%) Rwanda; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"LAST WEEK, the Ombudsman released her yearly list of individuals who've fallen foul of anti-corruption laws. Unlike last year, however, because I'm not currently in the country, I can't peruse through the list of names. I have however learnt that like last year, this list came out with the names of parents appended onto the names of the errant individuals, which I have always found unnecessary. Last time around, I wrote an article in which I asked, ""What had these poor people done, other than give birth to a person who decided to engage in immorality""? I thought that adding their names was unnecessary. I certainly hope that they haven't done so this year. Last year, I was amazed by not only how many people were named, but rather the nature of their crimes. The vast majority of offenders were what I call 'petty offenders'. These poor people, literally, were given long jail sentences for either asking for and giving sums that I'd call pocket change. And, as many people complained, the lack of the 'big fish' on the list was disheartening. I understand that corruption in whatever form should be fought; however, the small sums that are being handed over don't impact that many lives. What impacts lives are shady deals, like the scandal over the sickly exotic cattle. In fact, a year or so, I remember reading a story in this paper about how some leaders hadn't submitted their wealth declaration forms on time. Did they get any punishment? Not to my knowledge. Of course, maybe they were. However, any such censure was done behind closed doors. The errant officials were not named and shamed. But let us pretend that only those small fish publicised are the only ones guilty of corruption. I find it hard to believe that these people handed, or received, those bribes knowing that they could potentially go to jail for up to six years for simply handing over Rwf10, 000. The potential reward for such a bribe was, by far, outweighed by the punishment meted for giving/ receiving such measly sums. I mean. So the question is, did these people giving and receiving such small sums kamikaze-like, with little care for their creature comforts (I've heard that jail isn't fun at all)? OR did they simply not know just how harsh our anti-corruption laws were? I'm leaning towards the latter. The fact of the matter is, while almost everyone knows that corruption is bad, they don't know that the law doesn't differentiate between Rwf1000 and Rwf100,000. They assume that a small amount will elicit a slap on the hand and not a long stint with our friendly prison warders. The vast majority of bribes that have been sought from me haven't gone above Rwf10,000. And truth be told, I've been tempted to pay them. Not because I'm a criminal, but because the sum had the potential to make life easier for me. Especially when I was dealing with unpaid (or poorly paid) local government officials. And I guess that is the issue. While decentralisation has brought services closer to the people, it has turned some of these leaders into little tyrants. They are the people who sign each and every document you need to submit to bigger institutions. So, when you're met with a sly request for 'Fanta' you have two choices, either pay up (or become a criminal) or refuse and die a slow bureaucratic death. And you can guess what the vast majority of people do. They hand over the cash. And if it is a sting operation, then they are arrested. What is the way forward? First of all, people need to know what the law actually states. Don't only tell them the 'ruswa' (bribery) is bad, but inform them of the sentences handed down for the offence. It's all about educating them. Let them know that if they go down the corrupt path, it will end extremely badly. Secondly, let's figure out how to report corrupt leaders. Do we need CCTV cameras in the offices? Whatever the solutions, we must not rest on our laurels. Yes, Rwanda is known for its fight against corruption, but we can and must do better.

Corruption remains a daunting challenge to good governance and sustainable development on the continent. The journalists made the resolution after a weeklong training of trainers on Investigative Journalism and Corruption Reporting in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. On returning to their respective countries these journalists should pass on the newly acquired skills to their colleagues if the training is to have a major impact. Newsrooms across the continent need to be encouraged and supported to invest in investigative reporting with view to unmasking the corrupt. Media practitioners are watchdogs for society and are in a privileged position to fight the vice through objective reporting. They are the eyes and ears of society and are in position to hold public officials accountable. Their role in exposing the corrupt cannot be overemphasised; that's why they are referred to as the Fourth Estate. Rwanda maintains its reputation as the least corrupt country in the East African region, according to the annual Corruption Perception Index (CPI) reports by Transparency International. But this does not mean that the media in Rwanda should rest on their laurels; rather they should play a major role in efforts to nip the vice in the bud. Nonetheless, for the media to play their part they need credible information, they need dependable sources, people who are willing to share important tips. Society should view journalists as natural allies in fighting evil and demanding accountability from those in privileged positions. You can have the best laws as far as access to public information and investigative journalism are concerned, but without a collaborative society the media can hardly play their rightful role."543,The New Times (Kigali),4/23/14,Curbing White-Collar Corruption Is What We Need [opinion],,RWANDA (94%); AFRICA (92%),Newspaper,Junior Sabena Mutabazi,ENGLISH,24-Apr-14,,854 words,CORRUPTION (92%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (89%); BUDGETS (89%); MISAPPROPRIATION (85%); BRIBERY (78%); LEGISLATION (76%); CORRECTIONS (74%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (73%); FOREIGN INVESTMENT (50%) Rwanda; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"ONLY A handful of critics will argue against Rwanda's current steady drive to eliminate corruption from all aspects of society. Indeed, Rwanda is often seen as one of a few countries in Africa to have successfully implemented a framework to combat the vice, an effort that has led to the country posting negligible levels of corruption year in year out. As a matter of fact, many observers have gone on to credit Rwanda's stringent legislation as well as political commitment as the two main forces behind this success. In like manner, as part of its name-and-shame campaign, the Office of the Ombudsman recently published a list of people who were convicted of corruption in the last three quarters of 2013. The majority of the convicts on the list are by and large small-time criminals involved in petty acts of corruption and they include farmers, drivers, prisoners, and police officers whose cases state that they gave bribes amounting from as little as Rwf5,000 upwards to RWF 2 million. This is commendable and without a doubt the right action. On close scrutiny, however, when I look at the current and previous lists, I cannot help but ask; why is it that every year the list does not feature high-profile white-collar officials from the public sphere and senior management of business who are likely to engage in grand corruption? Surely, the form of corruption they are involved in has more detrimental effects than petty corruption. Grand corruption does not only delay development projects, it also leads to state budgets being distorted, foreign investment becomes stymied, and public trust deteriorate. I am led to believe that grand corruption often takes place when public or private officials seek to gain privately at the expense of the state. Incidentally, we have all read and heard of cases of misappropriation of funds by certain government institutions that have, for example, failed to deliver on their targets and cannot account for missing funds. When such mismanagement happens, do the authorities responsible for tracking what happened simply sweep the dirt under the rag and hope that things will improve in the next state budget, or are the culprits simply too clever for the current crop of investigators? There are a combination of factors as to why the current system is only able to identify petty corruption and not cases that resonate grand corruption. Firstly, one can argue that there is a lack of proper financial management techniques within public and private institutions required to identify the misappropriation of funds. This limitation allows those at the top level to swindle the system and avoid detection. Such cases are very likely to take place in areas that involve the procurement of public goods and services where senior officials are vulnerable to improper influence over the decision making process in return for undue advantage. Secondly, in order to successfully identify grand corruption cases, there is a need for an equally strong and superior policing and prosecution systems. Although I am in no doubt that Rwanda is heading in the right direction with this initiative, it is quite clear that more needs to be done on this front, and soon. Law enforcement agencies need to be given superior training whereby they do not rely entirely on the public to report corruption incidents on the most obvious occurrences. We know that grand corruption requires significant resources and a lot of planning to succeed and to ensure that they remain untraceable. Therefore, the state must respond with counter measures to take the fight to the culprits rather than wait in the wings for the easy prey. Thirdly, we need to demand more from the media and civil organisations to uncover suspicious cases that may involve grand corruption. In many developed countries, media outlets are considered public watchdogs with a responsibility to investigate and report on instances that raise concern. This involves follow ups, and often, hard-pressed interviews. It is no wonder that where media and civil society are reluctant to report sensitive stories involving grand corruption, corrupt politicians and officials have less to fear. In the meantime, however, what can authorities do to curb white-collar corruption - a practice that I am convinced exists in Rwanda much as it does in the United States, the United Kingdom, and even the saint-plated Sweden? In the short-term, I would call for investigators to assertively investigate cases of illicit enrichment - whereby officials cannot openly explain their wealth in relation to the income they lawfully earn. There is a high correlation between such wealth and embezzlement, concealment of property, misappropriation of public funds, and false accounting. I am not oblivious to the existing wealth-declaration programme of the Ombudsman's Office; however, I cannot help but wonder year after year, as to what happens to those officials whose numbers do not add up? Which list do they appear on, and why isn't this public knowledge? The writer is a UK Parliamentary Intern and holds a Master of Science in Public Service Policy.

The issue was raised yesterday during a meeting between members of the Standing Committee on National Budget and Patrimony and officials from the Public Service Commission (PSC). The meeting aimed at discussing the parliamentary budget framework for the coming fiscal year. Adolphe Shyaka Bazatoha, the deputy chairperson of the Committee, said: ""Transparency International has raised the issue of sexual corruption across all sectors, especially during recruitment. But despite the warnings, little is being done to address the problem."" A study conducted three years ago by Transparency International Rwanda, revealed that gender-based corruption exists in the workplace and particularly affects women in search for jobs in both public and private sector. The study also stated that about 85 per cent of victims of sexual corruption are female. ""Only about 5.6 per cent of gender-based corruption victims have reported to police or Ombudsman's Office, while the majority prefer to keep quiet for fear of hindering their employment prospects,"" the report read in part. Executive Secretary PSC Angelina Muganza, told the lawmakers that it is hard to fight the vice since both actors make extra effort to conceal the act. In an interview with The New Times, Muganza said the Commission will soon set up a structure that will help fight the vice. 'The Commission is aware of the magnitude of the vice,"" she said, adding that it is against the country's cultural values. In the PSC budget framework for 2014/2015, we have set aside about Rwf30 million to hire a professional independent organisation to conduct a nationwide research on gender-based sexual corruption,"" Muganza said.

Gatare said Rwanda National Police has taken measures to ensure zero tolerance to corruption, including strict supervision and control among the personnel. He said as Rwanda celebrates the 20th Liberation Day and Police's 14 years of existence, crimes were going down due to several measures like community policing, which have ensured citizens are part of the process to ensure security in their respective communities.

The bill, endorsed Thursday evening, will become law after assent by the President and promulgation in the Official Gazette. The draft law had been passed by the Chamber of Deputies in February. The recovery of offence-related assets, will help boost the country's anti-corruption fight, observers say. Rwanda remains the least corrupt country on the continent, according to Transparency International. But the country's existing anti-corruption laws were not clear on recovery of offense-related riches. The proposed law will, therefore, enable the seizure, management and confiscation of ill-gotten wealth. ""It will be a big boost for the country's anti-graft fight,"" said Senator Appolinaire Mushinzimana, the chairperson of the senatorial Standing Committee on Political Affairs and Good Governance. The law will give authorities powers to trace, recover, manage, or confiscate assets and benefits accruing from corruption, terrorism, and illicit drug dealing. Other offences include trafficking of human organs and tissues, unlawful stock market practices and irregular public issue of shares and other financial frauds, as well as kidnap and human trafficking. Some analysts have argued that recovering public funds embezzled by convicts remains difficult because all they do under the current legal framework is serving their jail terms and then go on to enjoy their riches once they have been released. Clment Musangabatware, the Deputy Ombudsman in charge of preventing and fighting corruption, told The New Times that the new law will help in the recovery of embezzled funds. ""Cases where graft convicts were compelled to refund stolen monies were rare because of lack of a clear legal framework,"" he says. The law governing the recovery of offence-related assets will also make it possible to recover ill-gotten assets from heirs to the convict. ""When it is proved that an asset is related to an offence provided under this law, such an asset shall be seized or confiscated in accordance with laws relating to the code of criminal procedure,"" reads Article 6 of the bill, which also states reasons for seizure and confiscation. Some citizens are worried that the new law might encroach on their rights if their relatives commited offenses. ""My understanding is that they (heirs) will not be criminally liable but will have a civil case to answer and recovery of the wealth they own may be legitimate,"" Athanase Rutabingwa, a Kigali-based lawyer, who is also the president of Kigali Bar Association, said. Francine Umurungi, the in-charge of institutional development and advocacy at Transparency International-Rwanda, says that the new legislation is one of those laws that will ease their work as a corruption watchdog. ""We always found it difficult to address challenges that were not provided for under the law. This law will make our work easy,"" Umurungi said. Management of seized assets The draft law stipulates that a unit in charge of managing seized and confiscated assets will be created within the Public Prosecution. The unit's organisation and functioning will be determined by a ministerial order. Article 18 of the bill stipulates that the National Public Prosecution Authority and the Military Prosecution Department ""shall establish in each jurisdiction of the Public Prosecution warehouse for seized or confiscated movable assets and its manager""."580,The New Times (Kigali),10/13/14,Ombudsman Drafts Youth in Anti-Corruption Campaign,,RWANDA (92%),Newspaper,Jean d'Amour Mbonyinshuti,ENGLISH,13-Oct-14,"KIGALI, RWANDA (69%)",204 words,CORRUPTION (94%); SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (77%); CIVIL RIGHTS (68%) Rwanda; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Governance,"Youth constitute the majority of the population and can play a bigger role in fighting graft in the country, an official Ombudsman's office has said.

Jeanne Pauline Gashumba, in charge of preventing corruption and other related offences at the Office of the Ombudsman, told a news briefing yesterday that this year's theme is in line with what Rwandans need-end of poverty, and self-reliance. ""Self-reliance is possible in a corruption-free country. A society without corruption attracts investors,"" she told journalists.

The deputy Ombudsman, Bernadette Kanzayire, during a meeting of anti-corruption stakeholders from Transparency International Rwanda, Advocacy and Legal Advice Centre (Alac), Anti-Corruption Justice and Information Centre (AJIC) on Friday. ""More people especially in the rural areas are still vulnerable to corrupt officials and hence communities should not be complacent about our recent success,"" Kanzayire advised. According to data from Transparency International's 2014 Corruption Perception Index (CPI), Rwanda's corruption perception score dropped slightly to 49 per cent from 53 per cent last year, leaving the country among Africa's five least corrupt nations. Kanzayire commended the tireless efforts by government to stem graft. Beline Uwineza, the Alac Regional Coordinator of Western & Northern Provinces, said there are still more complaints especially from the rural areas. These complaints are raised via email, text messages, website and are addressed satisfactorily. Uwineza said that of the close to 15,000 complaints received this year, only 166 were deemed irrelevant. He, however, mentioned that, fewer complaints came in via the websites and the email. ""Between April and October, 14,730 complaints were registered from Kigali, Kayonza, Huye, Musanze, Rubavu and Rusizi,"" Uwineza added. However, more complaints came from men with Alac centres recording 1,454 cases from females and 1,765 from males while AJIC centre's recorded 1,067 from females and 1,072 cases from males in the Northern Province. Ingabire Marie Immacule, the chairperson of Transparency International Rwanda, urged the public to be keen on reporting corruption and to avoid waiting for government officials. ""This is why there are representatives of anti-corruption organisations within villages to assist people from the grassroots,"" Ingabire added. Although many cases were attributed to land issues and judicial cases, Ingabire said the figures can further go down. She called on the media to continue promoting the fight against corruption. ""Although our fight is limited by funds, all people should continue to work against corrupt systems,"" Ingabire mentioned. editorial@newtimes.co.rw"597,The New Times (Kigali),12/10/14,"Youth Urged to Shun Corruption, Create Own Jobs",,RWANDA (94%),Newspaper,Thogne Nsengimana,ENGLISH,10-Dec-14,"KIGALI, RWANDA (79%)",400 words,JOB CREATION (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); BRIBERY (90%); EMPLOYMENT SEARCH (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); POLLS & SURVEYS (76%); CHILD WELFARE (73%); WAGES & SALARIES (73%); UNEMPLOYMENT RATES (73%) Rwanda; Corruption,"Rwandan youth have been urged to create their own jobs instead of bribing to get jobs. The Permanent Secretary at the Office of the Ombudsman, Xavier Mbarubukeye, made the remarks on Monday at a national youth anti-corruption debate in Kigali held under the theme; ""Lack of jobs cause of corruption among the youth."" ""The future of the country lies in the hands of the youth. If the youth involve themselves in corruption, the country is doomed. The youth should work hard and create their own jobs instead of giving bribes in exchange for jobs,"" Mbarubukeye said. Mbarubukeye was responding to youths who claimed that they come across many forms of corruption while searching for jobs. Chantal Uwimana, 26, from Nyamagabe District, said sex corruption was common. ""When searching for a job, some bosses assure you that you cannot get the job unless they had sex with you. I have personally faced such cases and I do not know whether I will ever get a job,"" she said. But Devote Nikuze, from Nyarugenge District, advised fellow girls to remain firm in the face of such challenges. ""If you have self respect, you cannot sleep with someone for a job. You need to get what you want on merit,"" she said. The boys said they are often asked to part with the first salary in case they do not have cash to give a bribe. Eric Muhizi, a student at the University of Rwanda, said on several occasions, he has been asked for a bribe in return for a job. With my certificate in electronics, I attempted several times but I failed to be hired because I could not raise the money, and those who had something to give were hired, he said. Several youths said they are compelled to give bribes in return for favours. The 2013 Corruption Perceptions Index that ranks countries based on how corrupt their public sector is perceived to be, places Rwanda at 49th worldwide and 4th on the continent among the least corrupt countries. The recent demographic and household survey (2013) shows that youth constitute over 60 per cent of Rwandans with unemployment rate among them standing at 3.4 per cent. The anti-corruption debate attracted youth from different varsities and higher learning institutions and representatives of the National Youth Council in all districts across the country. The national youth anti-corruption day was part of the preparation for the world anti-corruption day marked yesterday in Kigali. editorial@newtimes.co.rw"599,The New Times (Kigali),12/11/14,Is the Proverbial Cow a Dent in the Fight Against Corruption?,,RWANDA (94%); BOTSWANA (92%); CAPE VERDE (92%); AFRICA (92%),Newspaper,Edwin Musoni,ENGLISH,11-Dec-14,"KIGALI, RWANDA (79%)",640 words,CORRUPTION (91%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); ETHICS (78%); APPOINTMENTS (77%) Rwanda; Corruption,"Rwanda is one of the least corrupt countries in Africa. The country does not only lead in the Sub-Saharan region but also ranks third least corrupt on the continent after Botswana and Cape Verde. The country's record is attributed to collective efforts from different institutions and legal instruments meant to fight corruption and promote accountability. Among those instruments include the leadership code of conduct that requires government officials to be persons of integrity and the Presidential Order determining modalities for a leader to receive and give donations and gifts. Although the two instruments are interlinked and clearly define what an official can take and what they cannot, they do not mention gifts and donations that may be given as cultural attributes. Culturally, Rwandans give cows to each other as a symbol of friendship or appreciation. The cow is, for instance, used for dowry and as a reward for accomplishment or service. Some government officials wonder if they indeed have to declare cows given to them as bride price or as a sign of appreciation from friends and family as stipulated by the law considering that a cow may cost over Rwf100,000 yet the law instructs them to declare gifts and donations whose value is over Rwf100,000. ""We recently encountered this problem when residents questioned whether giving a cow to a leader as a form of appreciation for distinguished public service would be considered a bribe,"" said the Mayor of Kicukiro, Paul Jules Ndamage. Ndamage brought up the issues during a conference to mark the international day against corruption in Kigali on Tuesday. ""We need to ensure that cultural norms do not hinder the fight against corruption,"" Ndamage said. Article 5 of the Presidential Order determining modalities for a leader to receive and give donations and gifts stipulates that, leaders shall not in normal circumstances receive or offer a donation or gift whose value exceeds Rwf100,000. The article further reads that; ""If the official receive or offers a gift or donation that exceeds the amount prescribed, they shall inform the Bureau of Senate in writing. The leader shall, by his or her discretion, estimate the value of the gift or donation received."" In responding to the concerns, Ombudsman Aloysie Cyanzayire, said though a cow is a cultural symbol, the recipient should assess the motive of the benefactor in giving out the cow. ""Assume you have just been appointed a leader and suddenly someone gives you a cow, definitely that person is up to something. He may not ask for it right away but this person will leverage this action to ask for a favour in the future,"" she said. The director of monitoring of interdictions and incompatibilities of senior officials at the Ombudsman Office, Jean Aim Kajanga, said although the Presidential Order does not specify circumstances under which someone can receive such a gift, it is upon the leader to determine the value and declare it. The Justice minister, Johnston Busingye, interpreted the situation, saying that a leader may decide to take the cow but must place conditions of never to favour or be part of any situation involving the party that gave the cow. ""Gifts are good but it's upon leaders to detect manipulation because the law will catch up with them if they are involved in any malpractices. If that cow is a basis for someone to favour another, then it tantamounts to corruption which is punishable by law,"" said Busingye, also the Attorney General. Although leaders explained the cow metaphor satisfactorily, the fact that a cow is found in almost all components of the Rwandan culture including concepts, values, customs, symbols, rituals, art, dance, music, sports and social organisation, it is considered a taboo to refuse a cow - a reason that may call for further debate on the matter.

According to a recent report by the global corruption watch-dog Transparency International, the country ranks first in the East African Community sub-region, fifth on the continent and 51st globally. Observers attribute the ranking to the focus on accountability at all levels of government in particular, and a general political will in the country that ensures that corruption is fought tooth and nail, an environment that has benefited from the commitment. They also point out that, more than anything else, it is this commitment to fighting corruption that has had a positive contribution towards the improved outcomes in people's lives as resources are channeled towards the public good. Close examination reveals that corruption has been wiped out of the health and education sectors, for instance. In education, the management and provision of bursaries and admissions to government schools as well as in the areas of public procurement have seen vast improvement in transparency. The introduction of health insurance cover to a large population, central procurements for drugs and effective monitoring systems of health services have partially contributed to the gains While these sectors provide an insight into improvements in systems of accountability and transparency, they are simply indicative of the general trends in the management of public institutions. However, this is not to suggest that all is well in regards to corruption. The same report points to Concerns in the Justice Law and Order Sector (JLOS) and, in local government, which conforms with recent reports by the Rwanda Governance Board whose study suggests poor service delivery that is likely due to elements of corruption. Thus, while strong systems have been put in place and while there is evidence that they have brought remarkable achievements, some individual managers in a number of institutions, such as procurement officers, internal auditors, and members of internal tender committees, are undermining efforts to uproot corruption in public institutions It is obvious, therefore, that mechanisms alone cannot uproot the vice of corruption. More emphasis will have to be placed on monitoring systems to ensure compliance with said mechanisms. A combination of such is likely to produce even more positive results, especially now that the country has a regional outlook with ambitions to increase regional trade and spur local development. It appears that internal improvements combined with the harmonisation of the regional leadership code of conduct, public procurement systems, and the enforcement of existing anti-corruption laws are what is needed in sustaining the fight against corruption. With that, the internal improvements in service delivery as well as the present drive towards enhanced involvement of ordinary citizens in development programmes bode well for Rwanda's future It has been noted elsewhere that trust is an important ingredient in the war on corruption. As such, it is worth insisting that by engaging citizens to demand for accountability, a culture is built that encourages them to report incidences of corruption, particularly when such citizen engagement results in action against corrupt officials. It is an engagement that is likely to enhance the trust that citizens have for their institutions and towards their government.

The call was made yesterday by President Paul Kagame during the RPF Political Bureau meeting that was attended by over 3000 members at Petit Stade in Kigali. Kagame is the Chairman of the RPF. ""No member of RPF should use the party for their own gain or place their interest above the interest of Rwandans. As leaders, if you witness corruption and do not take action, you become a part of it,"" Kagame said. The President commended the achievements in the current year, where the economy grew by 7.8 per cent in the third quarter overtaking the 6 per cent projections. ""To achieve more growth is not just numbers; it is about the work you as leaders will have to put in for us to reach our goal. We have achieved growth but it is not enough; we must aim to achieve even more,"" he said. Rwanda aims to achieve an 11.5 per cent economic growth by the year 2017 and reduce poverty levels to 20 per cent by 2020 from the current 44 per cent. President Kagame urged leaders to work hard in order to drive the country towards self-reliance for the sake of dignity since the country's current budget depends on foreign aid at about 40 per cent, mainly from developed countries. ""We have to ask ourselves; why countries with 1 per cent growth are feeding countries with 8 per cent growth...this means we have to do more,"" Kagame said, alluding to rich countries with slow economic growth which still help poor countries even if the latter have high economic growth. On the agenda of the Political Bureau meeting, members were to receive reports on activities of the party, review plans and activities as well as talk about discipline of some party members. The Minister for Finance and Economic Planning, Claver Gatete, who gave a presentation about developing the country's rural sector, emphasised the need to develop secondary cities in the country to drive urbanisation, create more off farm jobs, reduce poverty levels, and invest in both agriculture and agribusiness. Under the country's long-term development aspirations put down in a plan called Vision 2020, Rwandans who are employed in agriculture will be reduced to 50 per cent, down from the current 72 per cent. Among other key areas of work, President Kagame urged party members to work harder to end child malnutrition, domestic violence, road accidents, and human trafficking. He urged party members to always see themselves as the answers for the country's challenges and work to address them. ""Without leaders who are considerate and understand the issues we will remain with problems. Let's keep moving forward. It is about strong will and upholding our values,"" he said."603,The New Times (Kigali),12/29/14,Is East Africa Finally Taking Corruption Seriously?

Not waiting to be fired was the Attorney General, who quickly handed in his resignation, accepting to fall on his own sword because it was upon his legal advice that funds amounting to 120 million dollars were transferred to an ""escrow account"" that served the interests of the parties in the collusion. Even in resignation, however, the AG insisted that his advice had been ""misunderstood,"" according to a report carried by one of the regional newspapers. What suggests that the action to fire and suspend government officials came after some arm-twisting is the continued insistence by President Jakaya Kikwete that ""there was no wrongdoing by government officials,"" according to the same source. Indeed, Kikwete is resisting taking full action against all the officials involved, despite continued pressure from parliament, the public, and donors. One is reminded of the scandals that were unearthed in Kenya by John Githongo, the Anti Corruption Czar in the Kibaki administration. In the book ""It's Our Turn to Eat,"" Githongo details the fleecing of the public purse by that country's elite in two major corruption scandals, Goldenberg and Anglo Leasing, in which hundreds of millions of dollars were siphoned. Thanks in part to Githongo's whistle blowing, Kenya has since responded by instituting a new constitution that, it is hoped, makes it much more difficult to plunder public resources at such an obscene level. It may be too early to point to the specific gains of the legal and institutional changes brought forth by such a change; what is likely, however, is that its spirit has recently led to the firing of that country's Minister for Internal Security and forced the resignation of its Inspector General of Police over negligence and incompetence, something that was unheard of in the times past. Thus, the firings in Tanzania and Kenya suggest that incompetence can take the form of the corruption of siphoning of public resources, and also the dereliction of duty, both of which call for accountability and responsibility by the officials involved. It is a sentiment that was aptly noted by Tee Ngugi, the novelist and columnist for The EastAfrican. Ngugi observed, ""By requiring the highest possible performance standards from public officials, the Constitution infers resignation in cases of non-performance. Kimaiyo's and Ole Lenku's resignations are, therefore, a huge constitutional step forward. Let's have more."" What Ngugi is hoping for is what is taking place in Rwanda. According to this newspaper, at least four mayors -including one ""who resigned after exhibiting unbecoming conduct of a leader"" - have resigned in the past three months. ""We sat down and decided to step down,"" said the now former mayor of Gatsibo, Ambrose Ruboneza, who resigned along with his entire team, in a change that included the District Advisory Council president. ""Ours was to serve the public, but it lost meaning when we were ranked last in performance contracts."" ""We lost public confidence,"" Ruboneza was quoted as saying. ""It was thus a wise decision for us to resign."" With different circumstances, it is unlikely that the way Rwanda handles public service management will be replicated elsewhere. However, it could serve as an inspiration in the fight against corruption and dereliction of duty. Uganda, for instance, has chosen a different path by establishing a College of Civil Service that was ""prompted by the numerous loopholes in the public sector such as corruption, poor service delivery and incompetence"", according to an official involved in the setting up of the institution. While some could be joining the party belatedly, what is required in the fight against graft and official delinquency seems there for all to see. Indeed, the cases noted above suggest that only punitive action can undergird the values that place a premium on accountability in the public sphere."607,The New Times (Kigali),1/24/15,"Poor Service Delivery Exacerbating Corruption, Ombudsman Says",,RWANDA (79%),Newspaper,Athan Tashobya,ENGLISH,26-Jan-15,,513 words,CORRUPTION (93%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); NATURAL GAS (87%); GEOTHERMAL ENERGY (87%); BIOMASS (87%); METHANE (86%); EMBEZZLEMENT (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); SANITATION DISTRICTS (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (74%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (74%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (73%); BRIBERY (73%); WATER SUPPLY UTILITIES (70%); BIOFUELS (70%); TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE (69%); CONTRACT AWARDS (69%) Rwanda; Governance; Corruption,"Better service delivery will bring down corruption cases in public institutions, Bernadette Kanzayire, the Deputy Ombudsman in charge of preventing and fighting injustice, has said.

Kanzayire's comments were echoed by the deputy Ombudsman in charge of preventing corruption, Clement Musangabatware. ""Corruption remains a problem but we must acknowledge that the government is working hard to curb it,"" Musangabatware said. Presenting the report to Parliament in November last year, the Ombudsman, Aloysie Cyanzayire, said the office received 102 corruption-related complaints, including 61 about poor service delivery and maladministration, 19 about faulty tendering procedures, and eight about mismanagement of public property. Others ranged from gender-based corruption in the workplace to embezzlement. Only 8 per cent are still under investigation. Lawmakers mostly raised issues on the gross glitches noticed in the former Energy Water and Sanitation Authority (EWSA) regarding the management of the National Domestic Biogas Programme (NDBP) and problems to do with the geothermal exploration programme at Mt. Karisimbi. Sen. Jean Damascene Ntawukuriryayo said some procurement managers awarded contracts to incompetent contractors leading to shoddy work. The Ombudsman's investigations found that some biogas plants, constructed in 2010, were dysfunctional because of errors during construction. Contractors who neglected their responsibilities went unpunished, the report said. Of the 15 districts the Ombudsman investigated, 1,341 plants were built but only 999 were functioning. The biogas project, which started in 2008, was allocated about Rwf3 billion for a five-year period. However, the Ombudsman said only 25.16 per cent of the funds went into the actual implementation of the project. On the geothermal project, it was found that three potential wells were awarded yet they were not in the procurement plan. The project's tendering document was also not properly done. By April, the geothermal project had already consumed more than Rwf13 billion. Unpaid receipts worth Rwf5 billion were unearthed while disputed costs amounted to over Rwf3 billion. Disputed costs included over Rwf1.3 billion in penalties EWSA was supposed to pay the contractor because when the latter brought in equipment to start exploration, infrastructure such as roads were not yet set up as per the contract.

Mupiganyi was yesterday speaking to The New Times at the closing of the Anti-Corruption Week organised by the Judiciary. He said there was also improvement in the perceptions and corruption related experiences by members of the public in regards to corruption in the judiciary. ""According to latest reports, the likelihood that a member of the public will be asked for a bribe by staff of the judiciary went from 5 per cent in 2013 to 2 per cent in 2014.

However, he added, the average sum received as bribes by corrupt judiciary officials had gone up in the previous year, from Rwf4o,763 in 2013 to Rwf44,708 in 2014, which could be attributed to the higher risk of being caught and consequences.

That, plus the kind of determination at the highest levels of the state to be totally intolerant of corruption, ensures both dissuasion and punitive action where dissuasion fails. This increases the cost of corruption to the corrupt or those who might be tempted to engage in it and thus keeps the monster in check, even if it can never be totally eliminated. And since as we know the fish starts to rot from the head, once you manage to control corruption at the top, the benefits cascade to the lower levels, especially if the big fish are held responsible for corruption and wastage of public resources within their departments, even when they themselves have not acted corruptly. The trick, of course, is to ensure a delicate balance so that managers do not become so risk-averse because they fear the consequences to themselves that they prefer to do nothing rather than be entrepreneurial, taking decisions whose negative outcome for the public might lead to economic and legal jeopardy for the managers themselves. As they say, ""Show me someone who makes no mistakes and I will show you someone who does nothing"". Anyone who has an executive role and who has the authority to commit public resources will invariably take decisions that, in hindsight, can be interpreted in a way that puts them in the worst light. And yet without those decisions, no progress could be possible. Thus the need not to look at decisions-even those that did not result in the most optimum of outcomes-as being motivated by underhand considerations.

You can't issue a title deed for free,"" a source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said. editorial@newtimes.co.rw Follow @EdwinMusoni"630,The New Times (Kigali),3/30/15,Corruption - the Case of the Hiccups in Rwanda's Scientific State [column],,RWANDA (94%),Newspaper,Lonzen Rugira,ENGLISH,30-Mar-15,,745 words,REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (89%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (72%); SWIMMING (67%); SPORTS (67%); HOSTAGE TAKING (50%) Rwanda; Corruption; Governance,"A couple of weeks ago in this column I pointed out that over the past decade Rwanda has been trying to create a scientific state, that the country has established mechanisms for applying a systematic approach to state management, where there is significant reliance on measurement of socioeconomic progress, and that such an approach is intended to domesticate 'development,' with explanations that are due to chance greatly minimised. It is becoming clearer that such a system can only succeed to the extent that the different actors in it have a thorough grasp of their respective roles. Moreover, it appears that it is this in-depth understanding that in turn shapes the very institutions in which they are deployed to serve. Effectively, therefore, outcomes are tied to the extent to which the objectives of the institution and the disposition of its actors are, in a mutually reinforcing relationship. Indeed, what should gradually come out of such a relationship is a sort of institutional complexity that is comparable to synchronised swimming. So, why are our public servants not swimming together - synchronically? That is the question that has underlain the topical subject of this quarter: accountability. The answer, it seems, is that some of them are in it for themselves. In the broader sense of things, therefore, corruption is a case of the hiccups in the scientific project. Its effects are apparently being felt at the local government level, where it has 'hindered' service delivery. It follows, therefore, that some are holding hostage the scientific state. Moreover, recent studies have indicated diminishing public trust the lower one goes on the state administration ladder. Worse still is what all this translates into in the context of state building: Those unable to grasp their role in the scientific state are operating closer to the people, in the communities. The scientific state is trying to create the ideal public servant who is perceived by the public as 'genuine and caring' - a servant leader. Such a leader would 'lead by example' and would be a 'mirror of good governance,' according to Francis Kaboneka, the Minister of Local Government. Mr. Kaboneka is speaking of a public servant with a heart for the welfare of the people he or she leads. Moreover, his message carries particular import in the context of recent revelations during the launch of the Governance Scorecard that, ""Corruption at the local government level has hindered the delivery of some of the most important social protection services."" The reported 'hindrances' were in the G'irinka and VUP Umurenge programmes whose intention is to give a ""hand-up"" to the most vulnerable members of our society. Further, one is reminded of reports of cases involving the misdirection of beneficiary contributions from the Mutuelle de Sant programme. There is little wonder, therefore, that Mr. Kaboneka is speaking about matters of the heart. Indeed, it is simply heartless that monies intended for the most vulnerable are being targeted by these swindlers. However, there was something else. Those who paid attention would have known that in the one hand, the Minister extended the olive branch; in the other hand, behind the Minister's back, was the big stick. ""Local government is the mirror of good governance,"" he started. ""No one will impede our aim of good governance."" Let those with ears ... Most importantly, keen observers would have linked the messages coming from the National Leadership Retreat in Gabiro earlier this month, the Minister's admonition, and the presentation of the results of the Rwanda Governance Scorecard, the tracking mechanism - with key variables and indicators of socioeconomic progress - of the scientific state. The message is this: Those keen on misdirecting public resources towards private use are in for a rude awakening going forward because the option whether they are allowed to thrive or whether the scientific state will prevail in efforts geared towards the delivery of socioeconomic transformation is a false choice. In other words, in the quest to deliver this transformation the scientific state must necessarily rid itself of the deadweight going forward. To paraphrase the Minister, no one will be allowed to hold it hostage. Some - bringing neither the olive branch nor carrots, just sticks -were a harsher in their antidote: ""Instead of drawing back the intended progress"" an official observed, ""they should just leave public service."""633,The New Times (Kigali),4/1/15,Tougher Action Is Inevitable in the Fight Against Corruption [editorial],,RWANDA (79%),Newspaper,The New Times,ENGLISH,1-Apr-15,,253 words,POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (90%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (90%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (78%); BUDGETS (78%); NEGLIGENCE (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); CIVIL SERVICES (73%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (72%) Rwanda; Corruption,"The Ministry of Justice has pledged to clamp down hard on all those involved in misuse of public funds. This tough action should also affect those responsible for delays in implementing government projects. The latest to emerge from the Public Accounts Committee hearings is that construction works for the long awaited Mageragere Prison were delayed because Nyarugenge District Officials diverted and mismanaged the earmarked funds. This is negligence on the part of the district officials. For a district leader to use the project money claiming they did not know what it was intended for, is not acceptable; these are grounds that breed fraud. Do districts have budgets and annual plans for the activities? Besides why use the money without inquiring from the treasury or local government ministry for guidance on the issue? Hiding behind ignorance should not be a defence. Action should be taken against the erring civil servants in this and other similar cases highlighted by the Ombudsman and the Office of the Auditor General. Government needs to strengthen financial reporting and monitoring systems so that cases of corruption and misuse of public funds are detected early to avoid wastage and delays in implementation of government projects. And, leaders should take responsibility for mistakes committed by the officials under their docket, while anyone found culpable should be punished without fear or favour. Otherwise, the fight against graft and mismanagement of public funds could end up in a wild goose chase."638,The New Times (Kigali),4/18/15,Anti-Corruption Council Calls for Efforts Against Graft,,RWANDA (94%); AFRICA (79%),Newspaper,Eugene Kwibuka,ENGLISH,20-Apr-15,,521 words,CORRUPTION (94%); TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (89%); BRIBERY (89%); POLICE FORCES (89%); PRESS CONFERENCES (78%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (78%); RULE OF LAW (78%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (75%); EXECUTIVES (70%); SUPREME COURTS (70%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (70%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (70%) Rwanda; Corruption,"Members of the National Anti-corruption Advisory Council have urged Rwandans, such as the media, the private sector, and the civil society to set up efforts against corruption. The call was made shortly after their extra-ordinary meeting yesterday, which focused on strategies of institutions in the prevention and fight against corruption as well as collaboration among institutions in the fight against graft. The National Anti-corruption Advisory Council is made up of the Minister for Local Government, two Deputies of the Ombudsman, the Minister for Justice, the Vice President of the Supreme Court, the Inspector General of Rwanda National Police, the Prosecutor General, the Auditor General of State Finances, the Executive Secretary of Rwanda Public Procurement Authority, representatives of the Civil society platform, and the Chief Executive of the Private Sector Federation. ""Corruption is a big threat to both individual and national development. It destroys people's trust in the government, allows the country's resources to be misused and it disables the rule of law,"" the officials said in a press release issued after the meeting. They renewed their commitment in the fight against corruption, stressing to that whoever will be found taking bribes will be prosecuted, using the country's anti-corruption laws. In a press briefing shortly after the meeting yesterday, the Minister for Local Government, Francis Kaboneka, warned everyone against corruption. ""We would like to call upon all Rwandans to stand up against corruption. Whoever is involved in corruption should stop because it destroys the country,"" he said. Rwanda is among the least corrupt countries in the world, with Transparency International's 2014 Corruption Perception Index (CPI), putting the country among Africa's five least corrupt nations. Government maintains an anti-corruption stance, with 97.3 per cent of Rwandans expressing confidence in the government's efforts to fight corruption, according to the 2014 Rwanda Bribery Index by Transparency International Rwanda chapter. According to the Prosecutor General, Richard Muhumuza, the country's prosecution office has filed 155 cases of corruption in courts of the 225 cases reported in the fiscal year 2013-2014. ""We have urged people to report more about corruption cases and the response is positive,"" Muhumuza said during the press conference yesterday. To the general public, members of the National Anti-corruption Advisory Council asked for adoption of anti-corruption values as well as cooperation in reporting corruption cases. The officials also asked the media to help sensitise the public about the ills of corruption and reporting about its cases. Entrepreneurs in the private sector were also urged to always report challenges they are faced with during bidding for public tenders. As for members of the civil society, the officials urged them to sensitise the general public about the problems of being corrupt and report bribery to anti-corruption institutions such as the National Police of Rwanda, the National Public Prosecution Authority, as well as the Office of the Ombudsman."640,The New Times (Kigali),4/20/15,Fighting Corruption Is Everyone's Responsibility [editorial],,RWANDA (92%); AFRICA (75%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,20-Apr-15,,310 words,CORRUPTION (96%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (89%); BRIBERY (73%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (73%) Rwanda; Corruption,"DURING their extra-ordinary meeting on Friday, members of the National Anti-corruption Advisory Council urged the media, the private sector, and the civil society to step up efforts in the fight against corruption. The extra-ordinary meeting focused on strategies of institutions in the prevention and fight against corruption. The war on corruption is far from over. Corruption is still a threat to national development, despite the unwavering efforts to stamp it out, especially in civil service. The role of fighting corruption is not for only the mandated agencies, it's a collective responsibility and will take combined efforts to succeed. The fight against corruption starts with you. If you avoid giving or receiving a bribe, then you are playing a key role in fighting a vice which stifles development. Report any suspected cases of corruption in your community and by doing that you are saving national resources from being diverted for self aggrandizement . As responsible citizens, we need to renew our commitment in the fight against corruption by volunteering as whistle blowers. Leaders and all stakeholders should keep the momentum through sensitisation of people on the dangers of corruption starting at the grassroots level. People should know that getting a service is their right and should not pay anything to get a service from any government official. With advancement in technology and development, corruption is getting more sophisticated and we need to devise more efficient ways of fighting it as the culprits have devised sophisticated ways to thrive. Rwanda is among the least corrupt countries in the world, with Transparency International's 2014 Corruption Perception Index (CPI), putting the country among Africa's five least corrupt nations. But this also means that we can't afford to lose our guard but rather to keep the momentum."501,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),1/19/14,'Corruption Hampers Chipata-Mchinji Railway Ops',,ZAMBIA (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,19-Jan-14,,254 words,CORRUPTION (90%); RAIL TRANSPORTATION (90%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (77%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (75%); GOLF (64%); RELIGION (57%); HOTELS & MOTELS (57%); CITY GOVERNMENT (50%) Zambia; Corruption; Transport and Shipping,"Vice-President Guy Scott says corruption is affecting the smooth operations of of the Chipata-Mchinji railway line. Dr Scott said some truck owners were allegedly corruptly obtaining business to shun the railway services. Speaking when he met the business community and faith-based organisations at Chipata's Protea Hotel last Friday, Dr Scott said he was aware that there were a number of corrupt activities taking place and that truck owners were sabotaging the sector. ""Everything is being sabotaged by the truck owners because of corruption in the railway sector,"" he said. Dr Scott also accused the MMD government of rushing to commission the railway line. He said the Chipata-Mchinji railway needed proper time and planning for it to operate effectively. Dr Scott said his Government was determined to run the Chipata-Mchinji railway and that things were being put in place to correct the sitaution. He said the resumption of the Chipata-Mchinji railway would bring economic benefits to Eastern Province and the country at large. Dr Scott said the MMD regime further allowed plots to be allocated on land where owners had title deeds. He said the MMD had no regard for the people and that the Patriotic Front (PF) Government was going to do everything possible to correct the anomaly in the allocation of plots. Dr Scott said he was also aware that Chipata Municipal Council was harbouring people who were connected to crooks.

The decision to dismiss the directors was necessitated by intervention of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) following reports that the officials were soliciting for bribes instead of collecting taxes. ZRA public relations officer Mumbuna Kufekisa could neither confirm nor deny the dismissals, but ACC spokesperson Timothy Moono said it was only right that the affected officers were fired. It is believed that the officials involved had in the past been asking for bribes from different institutions owing the Government various amounts of money in form of taxes. Mr Kufekisa could not respond to the Press query on the names and positions of the affected officers and institutions that owed the money to the Government. However, Mr Moono said in response to a Press query during the week that the commission had been investigating some officials at the authority and necessary action had been taken against the officers involved. ""I wish to acknowledge receipt of your Press query dated January 28, 2014 in which you wanted the commission to confirm on whether it was conducting investigations against some officers at Zambia Revenue Authority in connection with corruption in tax collection who have since been dismissed,"" Mr Moono said. ""I wish to confirm that the Commission has in the past conducted investigations against some ZRA officials with regard to allegations of demanding bribes and other corrupt practices during the course of their duties. ""Some of these officers have been arrested and convicted. It is within public service regulations to terminate employment of such erring officers."" There have been speculations in the online media recently about some directors preventing junior officers from collecting taxes from some institutions. On the other hand, the examination of tax assessment on turnover tax and value-added tax by the latest Auditor General's report revealed that the ZRA failed to collect more than K2.1 million from the available K4.5 million. It stated that more than K2.4 million out of more than the K4.5 million had been collected by the Authority. ZRA Commissioner Berlin Msiska told the Auditor General last month when he was queried that uncollected tax had reduced from K2,171,941,172 to K2,169,441,171 after some payments. ""However, no details of such payment (the stations from where these payments were made) were provided for verification as at December 2013,"" the report stated."516,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),2/18/14,Livingstone Scribe in Court for 'Corruption',,ZAMBIA (92%),Newspaper,Brian Hatyoka,ENGLISH,19-Feb-14,,164 words,CORRUPTION (92%); WRITERS (88%); CITY GOVERNMENT (87%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (86%); ARRESTS (72%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (70%); CITIES (67%) Zambia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"A DISC jockey and journalist working for Zambezi FM Radio Station in Livingstone has pleaded not guilty to one count of alleged corrupt practices involving K4, 000.

The corruption fight of late has been in the limelight hitting headlines in most of the media houses in the country. While corruption scandals have made the headlines in the country recently, the underlying issues have been deeply entrenched in the bureaucratic and political system for decades. A week cannot pass without reading something about someone involved in corruption either in the print or electronic media even on social media networks. Corruption has been and still is a significant impediment to good governance systems in Zambia. Since attaining independence in 1964, successive governments have instituted legal, institutional, economic and social reforms which have been largely aimed at enhancing good governance for improving public service delivery and contribution to economic and social development. Other politicians have also led successful campaigns to bolster people's standard of living and reduce corruption. Corruption is the misuse of the public office and public resources for personal gain. The graft is also giving, promising or receiving something of value in return for a favour. Two examples of corruption are a teacher accepting money from certain students for helping them cheat in exams or politicians using their power to take public money which should have been spent on schools and hospitals for everyone's benefit. Corruption was currently common in schools, bus stations, Police road blocks, borders, courts and other public offices. Lusa Luhana of St Monica's Girls Secondary School once wrote: ""Society today looks at corruption as an evil and immoral practice done in order to obtain a favour. Corruption may also be defined as soliciting, giving, accepting, obtaining or promising of any form of gratification by way of a bribe or any other personal temptation or inducement."" In short, corruption perpetuates poverty, unfairness and undermines development. Corruption is a huge impediment to the development of the economy and the betterment of the people's lives. There are many different causes of corruption including dishonesty, personal greed and lack of respect for other people's rights and human needs. Honesty and integrity are like the rains and without them there was no future. If public resources are misused, wasted or stolen by dishonest officials there could not be enough books in schools or medicines in hospitals. Corruption normally flourishes in many poor countries where people compete for very scarce services such as primary and high school places. However, corruption has a corrosive impact on international business. Fighting corruption lays out the problems and offers practical solutions on how to attack commercial dishonesty at its source. Zambia has made tremendous efforts in domesticating provisions of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) which includes the development and implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Policy to coordinate and direct the fight against corruption. The UNCAC was adopted following its signing by 140 countries. The enactment of the Public Interest Disclosure (whistleblower Protection) Act, the Forfeiture of Proceeds of Crime Act, the Plea Negotiation and Agreement Act, Financial Intelligent Act and the Anti-Corruption Act NO:3 of 2012. The Patriotic Front (PF) has followed the foot-prints of late President Dr Levy Patrick Mwanawasa who declared a war against any form of corruption. Eastern Province Minister Malozo Sichone said corruption was a cancer which derailed development and, as such, the vice should be fought with vigour. Mr Sichone said Government has continued to develop and implement anti-corruption policies and activities aimed at prevention of corruption and encourage accountability, integrity, transparency and proper management of public affairs. ""Political support is crucial to the fight against corruption. Government shall, therefore, continue to strengthen the Anti-Corruption Commission and other Governance institutions to enable them function effectively. As you may be aware, Government has already put in place some measures aimed at strengthening the fight against corruption,"" he said. Various laws such as the Protection of Whistleblowers Act No: 4 of (No: 4 of) 2010-meant to protect those who report corruption, and the Forfeiture of Proceeds of Crime Act No: 19 of 2010 which was meant to make corruption a non-profitable venture were already in place. Early last year, Government repealed the Anti-Corruption Act No: 38 of 2010 and replaced it with the Anti-Corruption Act No: 3 of 2012 which has seen the abuse of authority of office clause reintroduced and also increased the maximum punishment for corruption from 10 to 14 years. These laws are meant to give an impetus to the fight against corruption in the country. Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) director general Rosewin Wandi said the commission has continued to promote activities that were aimed at educating the youth on issues of corruption and soliciting their support in the fight against corruption. In the years 2007 and 2008, the commission gave the youth of North-Western and Eastern provinces some platform to talk about corruption. Ms Wandi said corruption was affecting good governance in many ways, saying the rules of governance include accountability, transparency and integrity. ACC regional manager Raymond Banda said the devastating effects of the scourge were there for all to see which included enriching a few people at the expense of the majority, draining the resources of the economy through misuse, poor service delivery among many others. Mr Banda, who is in charge of Eastern Province, said corruption must be stopped at all possible cost. He said 'zero corruption, 100 per cent development' must be transformed into reality. ""This transformation is possible if we, as citizens of this great country each take up a role and contribute positively to the fight against corruption both in word and in action,"" he said. Mr Banda said people must not only condemn corruption in public, while secretly practising it but stop it. He said people must not sit idle to see corruption taking place, because in doing so it was draining the national resources. Mr Banda said people must realise that no one institution or individual could claim to fight corruption. He said the fight against corruption requires concerted efforts from all stakeholders regardless of their political or social affiliation. However, recent slow growth has not only reigned in this optimism, but it has also revealed just how rampant Government corruption is throughout the country. Consequently, in order for the entire nation to experience progress as a whole strong leadership is needed at the national level as preached by President Michael Sata. Each organisation should be responsible for preventing corruption from occurring within its spheres of control."565,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),7/17/14,'There's Corruption in Construction Sector',,ZAMBIA (94%),Newspaper,Dixon Bwalya,ENGLISH,18-Jul-14,,1821 words,CONSTRUCTION (92%); CORRUPTION (90%); PURCHASING & PROCUREMENT (87%); FUNDRAISING (77%); CLERGY & RELIGIOUS (76%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (76%); BUSINESS & PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS (76%); RELIGION (75%); PROTESTANTS & PROTESTANTISM (75%); WEDDINGS & ENGAGEMENTS (75%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (72%) Zambia; Corruption; Construction,"ADMITING that there is a problem is the starting point in the search for a solution to any problem or a wrong. Recently, the Acting Chief Justice was quoted in the print media to have admitted that corruption was a reality in the judicial system in Zambia which position was supported by the President of the Law Association of Zambia. On July 6, 2014 Father Richard Luonde was quoted in the print media to have stated that there was something amiss in the conduct of some Church marriages where some pastors were bribed to breach accepted Christian procedures in the conduct of Church marriage ceremonies. The Acting Chief Justice as well as the Anglican priest are very senior members of their respective professions who have had the courage and boldness to call a spade a spade. Whatever negative social and economic impact corruption in the judicial system and Christian circles may be having on the Zambian society it is definitely chicken feed when compared to the damage caused to the nation by the rampant existence of corruption in the construction industry and yet no stakeholder has come out in the open to boldly accept this fact and pledge to fight this scourge. Traces of corruption in the construction industry are evident at all levels of the construction process from procurement methods by clients or developers right through to consultants up to the construction stage. These matters have been addressed before under this column. The tendency, for instance, to pretend to procure goods and services through invitations to suppliers of goods and services to register with companies on payment of non-refundable fees has no valid justification other than as a means of easy fundraising and yet this has become an annual event taking place at the beginning of each year. Providers of services in the construction industry are registered members in their respective professional bodies where they pay annual renewal or membership fees and registers are available to anyone in need of such services and it is therefore not necessary to request such members to pay additional registration fees to each and every company that advertises for registration to hopefully do business with them annually. And yet no stake holder in the institute of purchasing or other procurement bodies has condemned this practice. Single sourcing for provision of services in the construction industry has been in use for a long time but no strings were attached to this procurement process until recently. There are certain services which can only be satisfactorily delivered by limited specialists in the construction industry in which case architects and other consultants may nominate a particular contractor or indeed supplier to provide such a service because the consultants, based on past reputation in terms of workmanship, pricing and delivery periods, are confident that the so nominated contractor will deliver the requested services to the satisfaction of all concerned. Single sourcing is still used in procuring services in the construction industry only this time round it is sometimes dressed in sheep's clothing where those in need of services go through all the routines associated with open tender processes to give an impression of transparency meanwhile they have already identified who is ultimately to be awarded the contract, at a fee of course. One sign of such a ""wolf"" process is where the invitation to tender does not include a clause to allow participants to attend and witness the tender opening or the invitation to tender has too many unnecessary qualifications. It is the abuse of the single sourcing process which is used by those in charge of the procuring of goods and services to corruptly raise funds for themselves or even raise ""contributions"" to fund political parties. This may be done by asking the chosen and preferred supplier of goods or services to quote for the services to be provided then add a markup which is later given in cash to those who facilitated the contract award, that way it is difficult to trace these corrupt dealings. And yet no stake holder has openly acknowledged the reality of this practice. Appointment of consultants is sometimes based on technical and financial proposals where a decision is made depending on the financial bottom line. It is then possible, with a little help from a cooperating adjudicator, to submit an unrealistically low financial proposal to provide justification for the award of the contract with no intention at all of sticking to the submitted figures knowing very well that over claims will be made during the process of the project either directly or indirectly through connivance with the contractor/client project representative either through persuasion or appointment made through similar manner. An examination at the end of such executed projects would reveal that the so called lowest bid at tender evaluation stage has ended up with a tender sum much higher than the highest received tender sum at tender evaluation stage. This method of siphoning money out of a construction project may be applied at both consultancy stage and at project execution stage involving either the consultant or the contractor even the client or client's representative may have an active role to play in facilitating this process, all of course at a fee. Turning a blind eye to either defective work or nonobservance of specifications and contract clauses can lead to very significant ""cost savings"" which savings do not accrue to the client but becomes additional profit to the contractor most likely to be shared with the consultant who has suddenly developed technical blindness for a fee. The simplest example is where a contract agreement has included a clause on liquidated and ascertained damages to apply where a contractor delays completion of the project within the agreed contract period and instead of invoking this particular clause the consultant decides to turn a blind eye either by cooking up seemingly valid reasons to justify the extension of the building period or ignores to refer to the clause altogether. And yet consultants and contractors are not openly condemning this practice. A construction project would describe in advance the total scope of works to be executed for the stated tender amount. A possible loop hole is to adjust downwards the initial scope of works without similarly adjusting the tender sum for instance a road construction project may involve construction of the actual road, construction of a pedestrian/cyclist path and construction of, say, stone pitched storm drains. After commencement of construction it may be decided either officially or by deliberate omission to exclude works related to the pedestrian/cyclist path, for instance, but without making a similar adjustment in the tender sum meaning making a payment to the contractor including works he has not executed. This over payment may also come in the form of Contingencies; this is where an amount of money is allowed at tender stage to cover possible unforeseen works emerging during the construction period where if no unforeseen works emerge the amount allowed for contingencies must not be paid to the contractor since he has not executed any works under this item. And yet this practice may have happened on a number of projects and no condemnation has been made from consultants. There are a number of building contract agreements being used on various construction projects some of which have not been tested in courts of law and contain various grey areas even though there are court tested building contracts available on the Zambian building market. There are various clauses that address the issue of how payments for executed works would be made during the construction period and it is important to understand the implications of each of these payment clauses to appreciate potential loopholes that may be available as possible avenues for corrupt practices meant to unfairly relieve the client of his project funds. Most projects proceed to construction stage on the basis of construction tender documents including bills of quantities which comprise a full description of the scope of works to be executed for which a contractor submits the accepted tender sum and parties agree in advance on how this money will be paid as works progress. One method of making progressive payments to the contractor is by evaluating the quantity of builder's works satisfactorily executed based on the agreed pre-contract building rates minus any agreed deductions such as retention funds or advance payments made at the commencement of the project. There is a recent tendency to draw up contract agreements that stipulate payments to be made based on a per centum basis even though tender documents include priced bills of quantities. Such payment clauses may include terms like ""twenty-five per centum of the contract price shall be paid to the contractor upon completion of half of the project"" On the face of it this is a seemingly clear clause but it is, in actual fact, a potential area of abuse because while it is very easy to calculate twenty-five per centum of the contract sum assessing what comprises half of the scope of works may not be that easy. It is this grey area where a contractor may be paid, by connivance, more money than is actually due to him. In short there are potential areas of corruption in the construction industry which have been taken advantage of over the years. Just as the Acting Chief Justice has done as far as the judicial system is concerned, it is equally important that key players in the construction industry must accept, to start with, that there is rampant corruption in the construction industry which is depriving the nation of the much needed resources. Secondly stakeholders must make public measures they plan to take to curb the scourge; meaning the Road Development Agency, The National Council for Construction, the Zambia Institute of Architects, Consulting Engineers of Zambia, Quantity Surveyors of Zambia, Procurement Agencies and Association of Building Contractors in Zambia must accept that corruption is a reality in the construction industry and also outline corrective measures they will individually and collectively take. The Anti Corruption Commission should not adopt a position of waiting in offices for whistle blowers to submit cases of suspected corruption but rather be proactive and engage all stake holders to sensitize them on dangers of allowing corruption to take root in the industry and persuade the councils of these bodies to follow up and conclude cases of corruption or unprofessional conduct reported to them because a number of such cases have been frustrated by the same people entrusted with the responsibility of enforcing professional conduct. It is economically profitable for the nation to prevent corruption rather than prosecute offenders after resources have been squandered."611,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),2/3/15,CCPC Director Nabbed for Corruption,,ZAMBIA (70%),Newspaper,James Kunda,ENGLISH,4-Feb-15,"LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (70%)",120 words,CORRUPTION (93%); ARRESTS (90%); CONSUMER PROTECTION (88%); CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (88%); CONSUMER LAW (86%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (86%) Zambia; Corruption,"THE Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has arrested Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) director of legal and corporate services Maureen Mwanza, for corrupt practices involving K50, 000.

A4T is a pioneering project that fights corruption and mismanagement of public funds by putting the power to monitor the vice in the hands of citizens through the use of latest technology. The project is funded by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) and managed by Fojo Media Institute at Linnaeus University. A4T coordinator, Andrew Miti said many people, especially at the grassroots, were afraid to report suspected corruption because of fear. He said as part of the activities, the project was carrying out awareness activities in Lusaka communities, educating people on the importance of reporting corruption in their communities. The ground-breaking project is being implemented in the health and education sectors in Lusaka District only but may be rolled out to the rest of the sectors if successful. Mr Miti explained that people could now report suspected corruption in an efficient and anonymous manner by visiting the A4T official website at (www.actionfortransparency.org) or downloading for free the project mobile app. ""By visiting the A4T website, people can know how much has been allocated or spent on their schools and clinics. Equipped with this knowledge, they can question or even report suspected mismanagement of public funds or corruption by using a mobile phone. ""The report will then be published on our website, facebook or even on the Transparency International website. Prosecution authorities such as the ACC may even take action,"" Mr Miti said. The project is being implemented by the Zambia Institute of Mass Communication Educational Trust ZAMCOM in collaboration with the Anti-corruption Commission (ACC) and Transparency International Zambia (TIZ). The project has already conducted sensitisation activities in Linda, Mandevu and Kabanana townships, and more would follow in other townships, and the feedback from members of the public was overwhelming. Mr Miti said it had come to the attention of project officials during the awareness drives that many cases of corruption were going unreported in the communities because of fear. ""This is why are equipping community members with knowledge on how to track resources allocated to clinics and schools within their communities,"" Mr Miti said."625,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),3/7/15,Women Must Join Fight Against Corruption,,ZAMBIA (92%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,8-Mar-15,"LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (71%)",431 words,CORRUPTION (94%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); BRIBERY (78%); POLITICS (71%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (71%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (67%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (67%) Zambia; Women and Gender; Corruption,"AS women toast their day today, it would be pleasing if they used their powerful voice to highlight corrupt practices that appear to be an everyday phenomenon at the grassroots level. Corrupt behaviour is wrong, so everyone agrees, because the vice is often integrated in the essential aspects of the economic, social and political system. This is why corruption poses a danger to development as it threatens to sap the nation of economic resources. As a result all people desire to have it wiped off the face of society. When people talk of corruption in Zambia, like many other countries, eyes are often focused on the technocrats and, most importantly, political decision-makers. Corruption emanating from especially the latter - this powerful group of people - is called political corruption and mainly occurs when the laws and regulations are abused, side-stepped, ignored, or even tailored by those in high offices to fit their interests. This is where such things as Government contracts are illegitimately given to private individuals, usually not on merit but precisely because of the connections they have with those awarding them as they try to amass wealth for themselves. One of the end results, as often stated in the Auditor-General's report, is misallocation of resources. There is also what is commonly known as petty corruption, which is bribery in connection with the implementation of existing laws, rules and regulations. Technocrats and just ordinary citizens are mostly involved in this vice. Some people call this 'low level' or 'street level' corruption because modest sums of money are involved. Yet people experience it more or less daily. This form of corruption takes place in people's daily encounter with police at roadblocks, public administrators and service providers at such places as hospitals, schools, and local licensing or levying offices and other places. 'Low level' or 'street level' corruption, therefore, does not take place in posh offices, highways or central business districts of towns and cities. As Action for Transparency (A4T) says, this form of corruption is rife at the grassroots level, yet people who are victims of this vice do not bother to report it, perhaps because they feel it is a normal way of life. It is encouraging, therefore, to note that A4T is carrying out sensitisation activities in communities, beginning with Lusaka, educating people on the importance of reporting corrupt activities of the low-level nature and, surely, the project needs everyone's support, especially women movements whose voice is usually louder and clearer."627,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),3/13/15,Dj Convicted for Corruption,,ZAMBIA (92%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,15-Mar-15,,256 words,CORRUPTION (92%); MAGISTRATES (90%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (90%); CITY GOVERNMENT (78%); BRIBERY (77%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (76%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (73%); CITIES (70%) Zambia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE Livingstone Magistrate's Court has convicted a Disc Jockey (DJ) and journalist working for Zambezi FM radio station in Livingstone for engaging in corrupt practices. Danny Anakene, 39, of House Number DNB 111, Dambwa North in Livingstone was charged with one count of corrupt practice with a public officer contrary to the Laws of Zambia. Details are that between November 1, 2012 and December 31, 2012 in Livingstone, Anakene corruptly offered K4,000 to Vivian Chikoti, a town clerk then at the Livingstone City Council as an inducement for her to allocate him a piece of Land in Livingstone. When the matter came up for judgment in Livingstone yesterday, Livingstone Resident Magistrate Chinkashi Chilingala said he found the accused guilty as charged and convicted him accordingly. He said Anakene had been convicted because he acted in a corrupt manner when he offered K4,000 to a public officer, Ms Chikoti, for a plot he never applied for. Mr Chilingala said it was also overwhelming to note that the accused had not applied for a plot when he offered K4,000 and that there was no logic for the accused to seek acceptance of the money for a service that was not provided. ""I am reluctant to accept the explanation by the accused person that part of the K4,000 was for the payment of the plot fee and a gift for the services which were never provided. ""I am convinced that the K4,000 offer was meant to bribe Ms Chikoti and I have therefore, found the accused guilty as charged and convict him accordingly,"" Magistrate Chilingala said."635,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),4/9/15,'Fight Corruption in Procurement Process',,ZAMBIA (93%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,10-Apr-15,,332 words,CORRUPTION (91%); PURCHASING & PROCUREMENT (91%); GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (90%); ECONOMIC NEWS (90%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (90%); SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT (90%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (90%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (88%); SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE (74%); RURAL DEVELOPMENT (74%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (73%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (73%); POOR POPULATION (69%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (69%); MISAPPROPRIATION (67%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (65%); POVERTY RATES (65%); RURAL COMMUNITIES (64%); HOTELS & MOTELS (55%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (50%) Zambia; Corruption; Governance,"GOVERNMENT has urged the Zambia Institute of Purchasing and Supply (ZIPS) to help fight corruption in the procurement processes. Transport, Works, Supply and Communication Minister Yamfwa Mukanga said the Patriotic Front (PF) Government was determined to fight corruption and hence it was important for ZIPS to join hands in fighting the scourge. Mr Mukanga said it was high time the procurement and supply professionals started defending the profession by ensuring that the established procedures and guidelines in the procurement process were followed. He was speaking in Livingstone at Zambezi Sun Hotel yesterday when he officially opened the third ZIPS annual national conference under the theme, 'Celebrating jubilee and focusing on the economic growth beyond the jubilee'. ""There will be no development without procurement and that is how important this procurement and supply profession is. ""Therefore, the mismanagement of this function has always had adverse effects in the economy such as increased costs for goods and services, misapplication of funds, mismanagement of funds, lack of transparency and accountability, wastage of materials and the list is endless,"" Mr Mukanga said. He said the quality of purchasing professionals must change through continuous professional training, capacity building and skills improvement. Mr Mukanga said despite an impressive economic growth averaging six per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per year, the country still needs to reduce poverty levels which are high especially in rural areas. ""We need to improve in agriculture and also tap into the mineral resources and place emphasis on enhancing growth and rural development,"" Mr Mukanga said. Speaking earlier, ZIPS President George Mumba said their role as supply chain management professionals was to support the Government in its pursuit of creating sustainable economic development. Mr Mumba said this could be achieved through adherence to procurement procedures as good governance tenets."636,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),4/14/15,ACC Records 413 Suspected Corruption Cases,,ZAMBIA (90%),Newspaper,Nakubiana Shabongo,ENGLISH,14-Apr-15,"LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (90%)",390 words,CORRUPTION (96%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); ARRESTS (90%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (90%); ELECTION FRAUD (89%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (74%); CONTRACT AWARDS (74%); POLITICAL PARTIES (73%); POLITICS (72%); POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS (69%); ACQUITTAL (69%) Zambia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has received 413 reports of suspected cases of corruption in the first quarter of this year.

Mr Moono said this during the ACC first quarter media briefing for 2015 in Lusaka yesterday. He said that of the 129 cases, 60 were authorised for investigations, while 56 reports did not have sufficient details of the corruption offences to warrant investigations to be conducted. ""Currently, the commission has a total of 1,151 cases under investigation. The commission recorded 12 arrests around the country and 92 prosecution cases are before the courts of law. We recorded 5 acquittals, secured 9 convictions and 10 cases were at appeal stage,"" he said. Some of the ongoing matters and convictions which occurred during the quarter and those forwarded from the previous year include the arrests of Southern Province Permanent Secretary Annie Sinyangwe, Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary Annie Mwewa, and Mwansabombwe Member of Parliament Rodgers Mwewa which are before the courts of law. Mr Moono reaffirmed the commission's commitment to the fight against corruption to ensure the country yields results that contribute to good governance and national development. The ACC also carried out investigations where the commission received 3 complaints of suspected electoral corruption that were unsubstantiated. Mr Moono said the ACC had monitored various campaign rallies and activities of political parties which participated in the January 20 election to ensure they adhered to the provisions of the law pertaining to electoral corruption. On the alleged corruption in the procurement of Oil, he said that the ACC was vigorously following up the matter to take note of allegations of corruption. He said that the Commission sat on various tender committees to ensure that guidelines were followed. ""The ACC acknowledged the allegations of the illegal procurement of oil as the country had a shortage and will take measures to tackle the issue. This was in public domain and we are following it up to ensure transparency and accountability,"" he said. On communication towers, he said that the commission was thoroughly investigating the construction of the towers and how the tenders were awarded."623,The Daily Monitor,3/7/15,"With corruption, Ugandans need not wake up from deep sleep",,UGANDA (96%); AFRICA (92%),Newspaper,Henry Edison Okurut -1,,7-Mar-15,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (91%)",244  words,CORRUPTION (90%),"This way you might be catapulted overnight from your current sleep depriving jua kali work environment into the air conditioned sleep-inducing palatial settings of a ministerial office!

I agree with the President entirely. But does one need to lose sleep in order to earn a decent living in Uganda today? Not necessarily! For example, when you are a Member of Parliament, all you need do is ensure a regular monthly flow of about Shs20m into your personal account and programme your sleep in such a way that, you are always able to wake up in time to vote in favour of the ruling government! This way you might be catapulted overnight from your current sleep depriving jua kali work environment into the air conditioned sleep-inducing palatial settings of a ministerial office! As for the typical Ugandan bureaucrat, all you need is to master and perfect the art of making trumped up requisitions that actually get paid and properly accounted for as you snore away!
