It is indeed an honour and privilege for me to be given this opportunity to deliver a keynote address at the third launch of such an important campaign - the Anti-corruption Revolution. I must from the outset congratulate your Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for initiating such a campaign. It is more pleasing to note that the Anti-Corruption Revolution concept is designed to provide a platform for citizens' participation in the fight against corruption, economic and financial crimes in Nigeria. This is an important recognition that the Government cannot fight corruption alone, but needs the active participation of ordinary citizens, the public sector, the private sector and the civil society. Corruption is a problem that affects us all; we are all its victims; therefore we all have to be involved in fighting against it. I applaud you for reaching out to the public and civil society because corruption is a problem of immense proportions. It is complex and threatens national development and service delivery. Public education and mobilisation is therefore, crucial because we do not only need people's active participation but their confidence and support as well. Corruption should never be allowed to grow roots in any society. It must be nipped in the bud before it becomes widespread and sophisticated to a point where it threatens the very fabric of society. When corruption reaches endemic proportions it impacts on all aspects of life, and nothing can be done unless a palm is greased. For example, a bribe to the right person will enable one to pass an examination, get a driver's licence, land a contract and win a law-suit. Corruption should never be allowed to become an acceptable culture in any society. It is therefore, pleasing to note that as a nation you have taken it upon yourself to start a process of uprooting the germination of such a dangerous tumour. Nobody is going to come from somewhere to weed corruption in Nigeria, but it is up to the Nigerians themselves, at all levels, to shoulder that responsibility. I am, therefore, happy that what we are witnessing, in the form of the Anti-corruption Revolution campaign, are efforts of a people taking up the responsibility of building a clean society. Corruption retards development because it leads to loss of Government revenue; it leads to a slowdown in the development of essential services; it is a threat to democracy - because it can enable those involved to win power and influence; it can circumvent the will of the people and undermine the rule of law. It is enemy number one of law and order and good governance. Corruption also exacerbates poverty in that it effectively transfers resources from state coffers to the few rich and powerful. However, it is not confined to the rich and powerful, but corrupt Licencing Officers, Immigration and Customs Officials, Police Officers, Army Officers, can inflict untold damage to an economy and society. A corrupt bureaucracy can ruin the integrity of a nation, retard national development and impede service delivery. Greedy, selfish and corrupt public officers and that includes politicians, are a danger to development and law and order. Countries that have attained the dubious distinction of being some of the most corrupt nations in world attained that unfortunate label because of their corrupt bureaucracies and politicians. Corruption also distorts factor prices, to the extent that those at the receiving end are rewarded for little or no work done and the cost of a project turns out higher than it would be. Corruption distorts priorities in that those who are corrupted tend to give priority to development projects of little or no national benefit. What you are embarking upon requires a realistic and honest assessment of the extent of corruption in your country and its dimensions. Above all, ask yourself whether you have adequate political will to ensure that combative action is taken. Without political will this campaign will not go anywhere. It is also important to emphasis that for an anti-corruption campaign to succeed, the Government must be prepared to risk potential embarrassment to itself, and there must be an accompanying realisation that whatever mechanisms are put in place, they must be so organised and structured that the campaign and the campaigners have unfettered operational autonomy. The Government must also ensure that the campaign enjoys adequate human and physical resources, and that irrespective of the possible political consequences, there will be no slackening of resolve. You should also bear in mind that any anti-corruption campaign, which seeks to provide immunity to any group of people is bound to fail because it will lack public confidence and support, which is essential to its success. Allow me now to briefly tell you how we fight corruption in my country, Botswana. In addition to the constitutionally-entrenched oversight organisations such as the Auditor-General and the Directorate of Public Prosecution, we have established independent organisations such as the Directorate on Corruption and Economic Crime, the Ombudsman and the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Board. These key anti-corruption and accountability institutions ensure strict adherence to proper financial management practices and good corporate governance. They have strong legal mandates and powers to investigate and report on possible abuses and departures from financial laws and regulations, designed to protect the public interest with regard to, among other things, safeguarding of the collection, custody and use of public funds and assets, including land, the security of private property, as well as the freedom to trade anywhere in the country. An independent judiciary underpins these institutions, and we continue to exercise vigilance to ensure that they all adapt to the changing times. In Botswana we are committed to the goal of 'zero tolerance' for corruption. Our resolve is that corrupt practices must remain a 'high risk low return undertaking'. This has earned Botswana a rating, by Transparency International, as the least corrupt country, in Africa and the developing world, and indeed among the best in the world. Our anti-corruption agency was established in 1994 as a response to the unfolding of incidences of corruption in the country which were threatening our hard earned economic development and good reputation as a society. The DCEC, as it is popularly known, is an operationally autonomous agency armed with special powers to investigate acts of corruption. We have charged this agency not only with the responsibility of investigation and prosecution, but also modelled it upon other successful examples from the Far East, given it the responsibility for corruption prevention studies and public education. Public education is a major component of the DCEC mandate. This anti-corruption agency has made corruption a public issue, bringing it to the forefront of our citizens' attention. Because of public education and involvement the agency receives reports of alleged corrupt practices from members of the public and they investigate them to establish their nature. Those that happen to fall within its purview are followed and some end up as court cases. The agency also follows media reports on allegations of corruption. We also have a long established Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee, or PAC, to ensure transparency and accountability in public spending. The PAC, whose members are Members of Parliament from both the ruling and opposition parties, holds permanent secretaries to account for any misdeeds in their ministries. They have to account for their budget expenditure and that includes under-expenditure and over-expenditure. We have also embarked upon an intensive campaign to make the whole of the public service accountable and performance-oriented with a view to providing the tax payers with the services they have a right to expect. We inculcate codes of ethical conduct, transparency and accountability into the whole of the public service. Chairperson, let me conclude by reiterating the point I have already made that, the task of fighting against corruption cannot be left to Government alone. It needs partnership between the public sector, the private sector, civil society and the general public. Public participation, confidence and support are paramount in any anti-corruption campaign. I have noted with satisfaction that this is what you are doing - building partnerships between the government and other critical stakeholders - general public, public sector, private sector and civil society. There is no other way but for everybody to be involved. Your theme for this campaign - 'Popular Participation for National Rebirth'- is very much appropriate but it should not remain just a slogan; it should be translated into reality through the mobilisation of the general public. I thank you for your attention and wish successful in this crucial campaign."3,Concord Times (Freetown),2/8/10,ACC Mourns Corruption in Schools,,SIERRA LEONE (79%),Newspaper,Ibrahim Tarawallie,ENGLISH,,,12-Feb-10,,292  words,CORRUPTION (94%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (90%); STUDENT EXPENSES (72%); SECONDARY SCHOOLS (65%) Sierra Leone; Crime and Corruption; Education,"Deputy head of the Anti-Corruption Commission, ACC has voiced out his commission's frustration at the number of alleged corrupt practices reported in some schools across the country. Addressing members of the conference of principals in Freetown, Morlai Buya Kamara said the ACC was inundated with several reports of illegal charges, extortion, unfair treatment of pupils, illegal sale of pamphlets and extra school charges from the general public. ""The commission is seriously disturbed and worried about these problems in our schools. The commission's patience has been over-tested. What we have in our schools today is complete system failure,"" he lamented. Kamara said as a responsible commission, the ACC would not sit by and allow the educational system to collapse due to corruption, adding that they would ensure they enforce what was inside the ACC Act. ""This time around, we are very much determined to prove the conference of principals wrong. Let us try and improve the system because if we leave it as it is right now, posterity will not be kind to us,"" he maintained. Kamara said some principals need commendation because of their role in ensuring that the education system is improves. ACC's director of systems and processes review unit, Neneh Dabo said the commission has realized that since the release of the education report last year, not much has been done. She encouraged the school authorities to report to the commission issues of importance. Some of the schools that were reported to the ACC include; St. Augustine secondary school in Lungi for increase in school fees; Government Rokel secondary school; Government Model; and Albert Academy for illegal sale of pamphlets to pupils; and Prince of Wales for unfair treatment to pupils."4,The New Times (Kigali),2/8/10,Nyamabuye Local Leaders Accused of Corruption,,RWANDA (79%),Newspaper,Daniel Sabiiti,ENGLISH,,,10-Feb-10,,163  words,BRIBERY (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); EXECUTIVES (88%); WETLANDS (55%) Rwanda,"Local leaders in Nyamabuye sector along with local defence in the area have been accused of taking bribes. Nyamabuye Sector Executive Secretary, Jean Babptiste Mugunga made the remarks on Saturday, after a resident Sosthene Minani- said he bribed grass-roots leaders and local defence personnel in an effort to get authorisation to construct a house in a wetland. Minani, whose house was being demolished by local leaders and security official said: ""I cannot understand why my house is being demolished yet I have already handed Rwf600,000 to some local leaders including police and local defence personnel in Gahogo cell."" He added that he paid the last instalment of Rwf100,000 on February 4 through a third party. The District agronomist, Jonathan Sunzu, said Minani was informed of the illegal activity and asked to halt the construction, but didn't heed. Reacting to the claims, Mugunga said, 'we are going to investigate this case and culprits involved will be severely punished."""5,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),2/8/10,Clergyman Cites Corruption in Church,,ZAMBIA (93%),Newspaper,Chishimba Chishimba,ENGLISH,,,10-Feb-10,,407  words,RELIGION (94%); CLERGY & RELIGIOUS (91%); CORRUPTION (90%); CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY (90%) Zambia; Religion,"UNITED Church of Zambia (UCZ) Synod Bishop Mutale Mulumbwa has called for transparency in the manner members handle finances as the church should be free from underhand activities. Bishop Mulumbwa regretted that issues pertaining to church finances in some congregations were being done 'underground.' The Bishop was speaking in Ndola yesterday during a sermon at Northrise Congregation under the theme 'finding out what pleases the Lord'. He said in some instances, church treasurers and other congregation leaders did not want to make public financial positions and revenue of the church because they lacked accountability. ""There is corruption in church. Things are being done underground. There should be transparency in the way things are done,"" he said. Bishop Mulumbwa, however, expressed happiness that at Northrise Congregation, church leaders were able to outline every income and expenditure to congregants and appealed to others to do the same. ""I am happy that things here are being done transparently. The announcements about money are important. This building is beautiful because of the manner you are handling matters. I was here when it was just a plot some years back,"" he said. In an apparent reference to the need to contribute to the church, he said God had his own way of doing things and advised Christians to always establish what the Lord wanted. ""You should pay attention to what God requires us to do. Many Christians ask God to give them what they want, but they don't want to give to God what he wants,"" he said Quoting from Luke chapter 6 Verse 38, Bishop Mulumbwa said Christians should give willingly to others, so that in return they would continue to receive with the blessings of the Lord. ""God is not the beneficiary, beneficiaries are ourselves. People should learn to please God. Give and it shall be given to you. When you do what God wants, you are inspired,"" he said. He said people should not get discouraged by fellow Christians who disparage them when they contribute to the Church's development, as it is those who give in good faith that will enhance God's work. Northrise Congregation minister-in-charge, Mwape Chilombo said she was elated that the Synod Bishop found time to deliver a sermon when the congregation launched the first English service. Reverend Chilombo said the English service was introduced because the congregation had grown and some were not conversant with the vernacular language, Bemba."6,Concord Times (Freetown),2/15/10,Immigration Dept Admits Corruption,,SIERRA LEONE (93%),Newspaper,Alusine Sesay,ENGLISH,,,19-Feb-10,,197  words,CORRUPTION (94%); IMMIGRATION (93%); EXECUTIVES (90%); PASSPORTS & VISAS (90%); TERRORISM (52%) Sierra Leone; Migration; Crime and Corruption,"Chief Immigration Officer has admitted to the public that his office was guilty of corruption. Alpha Kholifa Koroma said he was not surprised when President Ernest Bai Koroma accused the institution of being corrupt. The department was counted among institutions which the president recently upbraided for not performing to the expectations of the government and members of the public, and also for being corrupt. The Immigration department was particularly scolded by the president for issuing out passports to foreigners. Koroma revealed that there were workers who were bent on derailing the president's agenda for change. He accused some unscrupulous immigration officers of issuing out passports to foreigners thereby imperiling the country's image. The Immigration boss totally condemned the act of criminally selling Sierra Leonean passports to foreigners saying, ""Terrorists can use it to create havoc elsewhere while Sierra Leone will carry the blame"". He promised to put stringent measures in place to curb all corrupt practices currently plaguing the establishment. ""I have put in place watertight measures to stop all corrupt activities in the department,"" Koroma maintained."7,The New Times (Kigali),2/15/10,Parliament to Assess Anti-Corruption Measures,,RWANDA (94%),Newspaper,Edwin Musoni,ENGLISH,,,19-Feb-10,,246  words,CORRUPTION (95%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (92%); TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (78%) Rwanda; Crime and Corruption,"Members of Parliament, Senators and Parliamentary support staff are expected to meet in a day-long meeting today to assess the progress made in fighting corruption and lay new strategies to boost the role of Parliament in curbing the vice. The consultative conference organized by African Parliamentarian Network Against Corruption/ Rwanda- Chapter (APNAC-Rwanda) will be graced by the president of the Senate, Dr. Vincent Biruta. A concept paper from APNAC-Rwanda, a copy of which The New Times has obtained, indicates that the meeting will address root causes of corruption, policies put in place against it and how to improve service delivery as a strategy to fight corruption. The document adds that the main objective of the meeting is to sensitize lawmakers from both Chambers to take the prime role in promoting several anti-corruption policies. ""Members of Parliament are expected to come up with concrete and harsh measures against corruption and related crimes,"" the document reads in part. Several experts in the fight against corruption are expected to address the Parliament during the extraordinary plenary meeting. ""There will be several presentations on the current status of corruption in the country and the role of the Parliament in fighting corruption,"" the concept note from Parliament adds.

She made the call while opening a day-long parliamentary anti-corruption meeting organized by African Parliamentarian Network against Corruption/ Rwanda- Chapter (APNAC-Rwanda). The meeting brought together all MPs, Senators and parliamentary support staff. ""Corruption is a vice that is hard to eliminate and that is why collaborative efforts are required,"" said Mukantabana. She equated corruption to the HIV/AIDS saying that the two are closely related since both involve victimization. Mukantabana called upon the entire House to be exemplary in the fight against corruption articulating that Parliament should take a lead by being a corrupt-free institution in the country. ""Intensified curbing of corruption is one way to progressive development and economic growth,"" she said. The Speaker, however, accused nationals who do not invest in their country and opt to bank their money in foreign banks. ""Corrupt officials do not invest their money in the country; they instead opt to channel the money to foreign banks leaving people back home in extreme poverty,"" she said. The Chairperson of APNAC-Rwanda, Constance Mukayuhi, a member of the lower chamber, said that by virtue of Rwanda's position as one of the poorest countries in the world, it has to protect its economy by strengthening measures against corruption. ""In order to catch up with the pace at which globalization is moving, we need to do away with all forms of corruption,"" said Mukayuhi. During the meeting, lawmakers hailed government policies and strategies and pledged to increase their collaboration with State institutions charged with fighting corruption."9,Mmegi/The Reporter (Gaborone),2/18/10,Stop Looting and Corruption - Ntuane,,BOTSWANA (94%); ZIMBABWE (79%); AFRICA (79%),Newspaper,Bame Piet,ENGLISH,,,19-Feb-10,"GABORONE, BOTSWANA (92%)",501  words,ETHICS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); BUDGETS (89%); NATIONAL SECURITY (88%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (79%); CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (78%); RECESSION (77%); ECONOMIC NEWS (77%); CONTRACT AWARDS (76%); COMPANY STRUCTURES & OWNERSHIP (76%); MANUFACTURING OUTPUT (76%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (73%); BUDGET CUTS (72%); GOVERNMENT BONDS (71%); INTELLIGENCE SERVICES (69%) Botswana,"Member of Paliament for Gaborone West South, Botsalo Ntuane has called on government to adopt ethics that will curb corruption if it is serious about attracting investors here. He said there is a developing trend by some people close to power, to loot the government. Ntuane was making a comment on the budget speech on Monday. He cited instances where some ministers own companies that tender for the supply of government goods and services. This is wrong, he said, adding that it is unethical. He said people should make choices between either being ministers or businessmen. Though he did not mention any names, the MP was probably referring to recent reports that a company owned by the wife of Minister of Justice, Defence and Security Ramadeluka Seretse has won tenders to supply equipment to government security organisations. When contacted for comment late last year, the minister said he did not see any conflict of interest when his wife's company won a tender to supply the government ministry he heads with equipment, because the President had no problem with it. Ntuane suggested that it should not only be the President who declares his assets and liabilities but that all public office holders - MPs and members of the judiciary should do the same. He said the current system where Cabinet ministers only declare to the president could be a breeding ground for corruption. This, he warned will turn investors away as some of them prefer to do business with transparent countries. He alleged that Botswana is run by a few individuals who are looting the riches of the nation, as has happened in those African countries known for corruption and nepotism. The MP further told the House that government should reduce the budgets of the Botswana Defence Force (BDF) and Directorate of Intelligence and Security (DIS) because Botswana is not under siege. He also said courts should be given time to litigate on cases involving people who have been declared Prohibited Immigrants by the President adding that it is wrong for them to be kicked out of the country, whilst their cases are still incomplete. The MP did not hide his discomfort with the constituency league saying it should also be set aside because the economy has suffered a recession and there is no money. He said money spent on the games should be spent on important areas of social services such as trucks for garbage collection, repairing streetlights and provision of water system toilets. Meanwhile, Bagalatia Arone told the house that the BDP has for many years failed to develop his constituency. He said the President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe is a better man compared to the BDP government because he has educated his people. He said in Botswana the manufacturing sector has not been fully exploited despite abundant raw materials. On sport development he suggested that the constituency league be abolished and Botswana football Association allowed to run football in the country. He said the league does not develop sport in any way."10,The Herald (Harare),3/5/10,MDC-T Riddled With Corruption - Chamisa,,ZIMBABWE (79%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,5-Mar-10,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (79%)",169  words,CORRUPTION (92%); SENTENCING (90%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (90%); ETHICS (88%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (88%); INVESTIGATIONS (88%); VERDICTS (87%); JAIL SENTENCING (70%) Zimbabwe; Crime and Corruption,"MDC-T has admitted its ranks are riddled with corruption. In an interview on Wednesday, party spokesperson Mr Nelson Chamisa said they needed a code of ethics to rein in their errant rank and file. Councils dominated by MDC-T all over the country have come under investigation over allegations of rampant corruption. Recently, Government had to dismiss Israel Marange as Chitungwiza mayor after the courts found him guilty of corruption involving residential stands and sentenced him to serve prison time. Marange is appealing against both conviction and sentence. ""When people vote leaders into office, they do it because they want better service delivery and development and not for individual gratification,"" Mr Chamisa said. In other corruption cases, senior party officials are accused of plundering thousands of dollars in South Africa and the United Kingdom. The most recent incident of corruption in the party involves three Highfield councillors who are accused of clandestinely transferring houses into their names."11,The Herald (Harare),3/8/10,Tsvangirai Slams Corruption,,ZIMBABWE (92%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,8-Mar-10,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (79%)",400  words,CORRUPTION (89%); CITY GOVERNMENT (89%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (75%); AGREEMENTS (72%) Zimbabwe; Crime and Corruption,"MDC-T leader Morgan Tsvangirai has publicly admitted that his party is riddled with corruption that is threatening its integrity and vowed to fire all members found guilty. Addressing party supporters in Chitungwiza yesterday, Mr Tsvangirai said corruption had become a deep-rooted cancer in the party structures. ""What is happening now is a manifestation of a party yapindwa napongwe. This is a reflection of a party eroding as a result of corruption. This is a serious matter and recently we fired the Chitungwiza executive because of corruption. ""We again fired the Chitungwiza council that was also mired in corruption. As president of the party, I have an obligation to protect the integrity of the party and in pursuit of this obligation, I prefer to become the most unpopular leader for a very popular reason,"" he said. He maintained that the Chitungwiza councillors that were dismissed by the party for corruption did not have legitimacy to continue serving in the local authority. Mr Tsvangirai said he would meet the responsible minister over the issue soon. However, Local Government, Urban and Rural Development Minister Ignatius Chombo has already indicated that he will not fire the council over party squabbles. Mr Tsvangirai said some of the party officials who secured Government positions were abusing them for self-enrichment. ""Vamwe venyu manga musina kana nebhutsu chaidzo asi mave kufamba nemota six-six. We are very serious about this issue. Some of you are already building white houses, saka chii ichocho?"" he asked. Mr Tsvangirai's remarks on corruption come at a time when there are reports of corruption and maladministration in Chegutu, Bindura and Kadoma. Sources close to the party said a report that was tabled before the party's national council last week had shown alarming levels of corruption, with councillors being accused of enriching themselves. Turning to the ongoing talks over the implementation of Global Political Agreement issues, Mr Tsvangirai said the negotiations should come to an end to allow the inclusive Government time to rebuild the economy. He said people were waiting for the Government to deliver, hence the need to conclude the dialogue. Before addressing the rally, Mr Tsvangirai planted a palm tree at his Strathaven home in the morning in memory of his late wife Susan who died in a car accident on March 6 last year. He was assisted by his son Edwin."12,The Herald (Harare),3/11/10,Cast Anti-Corruption Net Wider [editorial],,ZIMBABWE (92%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,11-Mar-10,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (87%)",534  words,BRIBERY (91%); DRIVERS LICENSES (91%); TRANSPORTATION LAW (90%); INSPECTIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); LICENSES & PERMITS (90%); VEHICLE INSPECTIONS (90%); DRIVER EDUCATION (89%); TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE (78%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (77%); INFRASTRUCTURE (73%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (71%) Zimbabwe; Crime and Corruption,"INCREASED carnage on the roads is no doubt a reflection of deteriorating standards of driving compounded by the deplorable actions of some Vehicle Inspection Department officials issuing out drivers' licences to unqualified and undeserving people who are prepared to pay bribes to get the document. A motor vehicle is a very tame machine in the hands of a competent driver, but a dangerous contraption in the hands of an incompetent handler. This explains why prospective drivers have to undergo rigorous testing to determine their competence. This process should never be short-circuited by cash or kickbacks. To this end, we hail Government's cancellation of 199 drivers licences issued at Chiredzi Vehicle Inspection Department depot between January and June last year. The people holding those licences have to acquire genuine ones failing which they must stay off the roads. Learner drivers licence testing requirements are the same countrywide and there is no reason why those who fail to make it in Harare or Bulawayo end up making it in Chiredzi or Nyamapanda. We urge the Ministry of Transport, Communication and Infrastructure Development to thoroughly investigate the goings on at the VID depots. We have reason to believe Chiredzi could just be a tip of the iceberg as VID officers have for long been accused of soliciting bribes from all prospective drivers to the extent of failing competent learners who will have refused to pay bribes while passing dullards willing to grease their palms. Such a situation is a sure recipe for disaster and may account for the carnage on the roads. To this end we urge the relevant authorities to work to flush out the bad apples. This might warrant setting up whistle blower funds and sending plain clothes law enforcement agents to identify the bad apples who must be dealt with severely to send a message to all bent on corrupt dealings. It goes without saying that all the 199 drivers who got their licenses at Chiredzi during the period in question should undergo re-testing, and if they fail the officers who signed the certificates of competence should face the wrath of the law. It is also vital to categorically stipulate the requirements learner drivers have to meet so that they are not taken advantage of by unscrupulous testing officers. If the process is cumbersome and unclear, it fuels corruption because the learner drivers will not know whether they have genuinely failed or been made to fail in lieu of kickbacks. There is no doubt that the persistent allegations of bribery have tainted the VID's image to a point where many have lost confidence in it. Bribery is corruption of the highest order and the Government should clamp down on all offenders. Some driving schools are also known to work in cahoots with some VID officials to issue licences to incompetent drivers who have money to pay and there is need to monitor their operations and de-register all found on the wrong side of the law. When a minister goes public about dealing with corruption, like what Minister Nicholas Goche has done, it helps the public will feel encouraged to report any corrupt activities that they come across; safe in the knowledge that corrective action will be taken."13,The New Times (Kigali),3/16/10,"""Quiet Corruption"" Derailing African Economies - WB Report",,"AFRICA (96%); RWANDA (93%); BURUNDI (92%); UGANDA (92%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (92%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (92%); KENYA (92%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%)",Newspaper,Edmund Kagire,ENGLISH,,,17-Mar-10,,387  words,CORRUPTION (90%); DEVELOPMENT BANKS (90%); BRIBERY (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (78%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (76%); SCANDALS (73%) Rwanda; Crime and Corruption; Banking and Insurance; International Organizations and Africa,"The World Bank on Monday released the 2010 Africa Development Indicators (ADI) Report, revealing a new phenomenon of ""Quiet corruption"" that is pervasive and widespread especially across Sub-Saharan Africa. This new type of corruption is also said to have a disproportionate effect on the poor, with long-term consequences for development. According to the report, it is mainly attributed to the failure of public servants to deliver goods or services paid for by governments. The 2010 ADI report, notes that most corruption studies in the past focus on an exchange of money - bribes to powerful political designees or kickbacks to public officials. This year's report, however, focused on the way ""quiet corruption"" leads to an increasingly negative expectation of service delivery systems, causing families to ignore the system. ""Quiet corruption, although smaller in monetary terms, is particularly harmful for the poor, who are more vulnerable and more reliant on government services and public systems to satisfy their most basic needs,"" the report observes. Rwanda fared better than other countries in the region. It has the lowest percentage in the incidences of corruption and perceived corruption. ""Quiet corruption does not make the headlines the way bribery scandals do, but it is just as corrosive to societies,"" said Shanta Devarajan, Chief Economist for the World Bank's Africa Region. ""Tackling quiet corruption will require a combination of strong and committed leadership, policies and institutions at the sectoral level, and - most important - increased accountability and participation by citizens,"" he further added. Rwanda registered 19.96 percent of corruption incidence -where firms' informal payments are likely to be made or kickbacks given to have things done while in the area of perceived corruption the country registered 4.35 percent. Kenya on the other hand registered 79.2 in corruption incidences-making it the most corrupt country in the East African Community followed by Burundi with 56.46 percent, Uganda with 51.7 percent and Tanzania with 49.47 percent. In perceived corruption Kenya scored 38.35 percent, Uganda 23.57, Tanzania 19.73 and Burundi 19.71 percent. D R Congo registered the highest corruption incidences in the Great Lakes region with 83.79 percent and 20 percent of perceived corruption."14,New Democrat (Monrovia),3/21/10,"Impunity, Poverty = Corruption [opinion]",,LIBERIA (94%); UNITED STATES (92%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,22-Mar-10,,343  words,CORRUPTION (95%); CIVIL SERVICES (91%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); WAGES & SALARIES (90%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (78%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (78%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (78%); BUDGETS (77%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (76%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (76%); EXECUTIVES (74%); BOARDS OF DIRECTORS (74%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (73%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (73%); INFLATION (73%); ECONOMIC NEWS (73%); COUNTIES (71%); PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (66%); PETROLEUM REFINERIES (50%) Liberia,"Some causes of pervasive corruption have been advanced in the current US State Department report, amongst them 'the culture of impunity, poverty' and low salaries for civil servants.

Official corruption was exacerbated by low pay levels for the civil service, lack of job training, and a culture of impunity. On October 8, the auditor-general said that boards of directors of public corporations in the country were being used as ""cover-ups"" to justify illegal transactions. The LACC and the Ministry of Justice are responsible for exposing and combating official corruption, but it was unclear whether the commission or the ministry had responsibility for prosecuting corruption cases. The LACC, which had a minimal budget and insufficient staff, had completed no corruption investigations by year's end. ""Despite her strong emphasis on decentralization, President Sirleaf urged the legislature during the year to withdraw from allocating and implementing local development projects financed by County Development Funds; such funding was intended to support local projects to reduce poverty. The move to reclaim centralized executive administration of local development projects was widely seen as a result of inadequate management at the local level, which often funnelled development funds to support political interests rather than to reduce poverty. The government dismissed or suspended a number of officials for corruption. For example, on September 5, President Sirleaf dismissed the managing director of the state-owned Liberia Petroleum Refining Corporation (LPRC) after an investigation revealed alleged irregularities in awarding a no-bid 1.75 billion Liberian dollars ($36 million) concession."19,The Namibian (Windhoek),4/1/10,Ex-NA Secretary Denies Three Corruption Charges,,NAMIBIA (93%),Newspaper,Werner Menges,ENGLISH,,,5-Apr-10,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (88%)",774  words,CORRUPTION (92%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); INDICTMENTS (78%); LEGISLATION (78%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (77%); LAWYERS (75%); ARRESTS (73%); WAGES & SALARIES (62%); HOLIDAYS & OBSERVANCES (55%) Namibia; Crime and Corruption,"FORMER National Assembly Secretary Nama Goabab and parliamentary accountant Abraham John George pleaded not guilty to all charges when their trial on three counts of corruption started in the High Court in Windhoek this week. The charges against Goabab (52) and George (49) are all based on allegations that they illegally hired two vehicles at Government expense for Goabab's private use in March and April 2007. The total cost of the vehicle rental is alleged to have been N$23 552,20. Goabab alone is also accused of having illegally used a Government-owned vehicle for private purposes on the public holiday of May 25 2007. With his former position at the National Assembly having been on the level of a Permanent Secretary in the Public Service, Goabab is the most senior public official to have gone on trial on charges under the Anti-Corruption Act of 2003 to date. Together, Goabab and George are charged with two main counts of corruptly using their offices or positions for gratification, alternatively fraud and fraud or theft respectively. Goabab alone is also accused of corruptly using his office or position for gratification, alternatively using a motor vehicle without the owner's consent. ""Not guilty,"" Goabab and George both told Judge Marlene Tommasi when they were asked to give their pleas to the charges on Wednesday. In a plea explanation that Goabab's defence lawyer, Lucius Murorua, provided to the court, Goabab specifically denied that he had corruptly used his position as National Assembly Secretary, whether directly or indirectly. Goabab admitted that he had instructed George to hire a rental car for his use. The rental was to be at his own expense, he indicated. Goabab also stated that he agreed with George on April 24 2007 that the costs of the car rental would be deducted from his salary in instalments. The first rental is alleged to have been at a cost of N$5 055. Government did not lose that money, Goabab indicated. The second rental is alleged to have been at a cost of N$18 497,20. He paid that amount to the National Assembly on June 12 2007, Goabab stated. That was the day after he and George had made a first joint court appearance following their arrest on June 8 2007. On the third charge over his alleged unlawful use of a Government-owned vehicle, Goabab stated that he had the necessary permission to use the car for an official function, which was a memorial service for the late former Cabinet member Richard Kapelwa Kabajani. Goabab charged that the indictment under which he and George are being prosecuted ""is a mental construct of the Anti-Corruption Commission with an air of unreality"". He charged that his prosecution is based on bad faith, with the State having ""in an arbitrary and high handed manner criminalised otherwise non-penal administrative acts"". The State alleged corruption ""in wanton disregard"" of the arrangement he had to pay the car rental costs by way of deductions from his salary, Goabab stated. George's defence lawyer, Christie Mostert, also provided a plea explanation to the court. George stated that at the time covered by the charges, he was the Chief Accountant at the National Assembly. As Secretary, Goabab was in charge of George and other employees at the National Assembly, and they were therefore obliged to comply with his orders, George stated. With regard to the first car rental at the start of March 2007, George stated that he had been instructed by Goabab to hire a car for him. He claimed he only found out about the second rental when Goabab presented an account from the car rental company to him for payment. Goabab ""instructed me to pay the amount from our office's budget and indicated that he will make arrangements for the repayment of the money back to the Government,"" George stated. One of the prosecution's witnesses, Ulf Thaumuller, told the court yesterday that he was still employed at Budget Rent-a-Car when Goabab and another National Assembly official visited his office on April 24 2007 and asked to be provided with copies of invoices for two car rentals that had been done with the company. Thaumuller testified that Goabab told him that he would be paying for both rentals by cheque. Goabab also asked him not to charge the second vehicle rental on the credit card that had been used when the car was hired, since a cheque payment would be done instead. On a question from Judge Tommasi, Thaumuller said it was not indicated to him whether a Government or a private cheque would be used to make the payment. The trial is continuing. Deputy Prosecutor General Orben Sibeya is conducting the prosecution. Goabab and George are both free on bail."20,Concord Times (Freetown),4/14/10,Minister Engages Regional Workers On Corruption,,SIERRA LEONE (94%),Newspaper,Ben Samuel Turay,ENGLISH,,,15-Apr-10,,223  words,PREGNANCY & CHILDBIRTH (93%); WOMEN'S HEALTH (90%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (90%); DEATHS & DEATH RATES (90%); MEDICAL CHARITIES (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); INFANTS & TODDLERS (77%); CHILDREN'S HEALTH (77%); TRENDS (73%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (72%); BREASTFEEDING (72%); INFANT MORTALITY (67%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (52%) Sierra Leone; Crime and Corruption; Labour; Health and Medicine,"Deputy Minister of Health and Sanitation has concluded a week-long training of health personnel in the Bombali and Kambia districts in northern Sierra Leone ahead of the free health care service delivery for pregnant women, lactating mothers and children under five. The training focused on the need for medical personnel to stay away from corruption as the president launches the free health care package on Independence Day April 27. ""Let us stay away from corruption; very soon this ministry will be given free medical service to pregnant women and under five children in the country. Health personnel should not take money for the services they will be rendering, which is why we held the training sessions in the two districts,"" Mohamed D. Koroma said. The clinic started on April 6 and ended on Monday April 12. According to Koroma, a survey conducted by his ministry showed that maternal and infant mortality rates were highest in the north ""because people are still very much attached to traditional birth and delivery practices."" According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Sierra Leone has the world's highest death rate among pregnant women and children. ""We are determined to bring down the deplorable figures of deaths among pregnant women and children and reverse the trend which is not good for the country's image,"" he said."21,The New Times (Kigali),4/16/10,EALA Should Enact Laws to Fight Corruption [editorial],,EASTERN AFRICA (92%); RWANDA (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,16-Apr-10,,249  words,CORRUPTION (95%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); BRIBERY (90%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (73%); CLINICS & OUTPATIENT SERVICES (69%); HOSPITALS (69%) Rwanda; Crime and Corruption,"At the opening of the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) on Wednesday, President Paul Kagame, called upon the members of the EALA to use their positions to improve the lives of EAC citizens. He further reminded the lawmakers that there should be zero tolerance for corruption. It is one vice that is probably the greatest hindrance to public and private sector service delivery, with adverse consequences to the welfare of the people. When a road isn't built, or is built in a shoddy manner, because someone took a kickback, it's the road users and pedestrians who are at risk. When a public hospital doesn't get enough life saving drugs because someone in the ministry has diverted the funds, or even worse when hospital staff sell those drugs, it's the poor citizens, who can't afford to visit a private clinic, that suffer. When policemen and women accept bribes from errant drivers, they simply endanger the lives of road users. While corruption is often seen as a 'victimless crime' by the perpetrators, this isn't the case. EALA has a role to play in the fight against corruption. The first thing that they can do is enact an East African Anti-Corruption Bill. Additionally, they can use their visibility as eminent citizens to launch anti-corruption campaigns and sensitize their constituents against either receiving and offering bribes or engaging in any sorts of corruption. The fight against corruption needs everyone's involvement and the East African legislators can take the lead."22,The Informer (Monrovia),4/19/10,Finance Minister Denies Corruption Allegation,,LIBERIA (97%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,19-Apr-10,"MONROVIA, LIBERIA (88%)",365  words,BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (90%); PRESS CONFERENCES (90%); PUBLIC FINANCE (90%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (90%); AUDITS (89%); US DOLLAR (78%); CORRUPTION (73%); PUBLIC DEBT (71%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (69%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (55%) Liberia; Crime and Corruption,"Finance Minister Augustine Ngafuan has reacted sharply to media reports, that he is involved in the disappearing of millions of dollars at the ministry. Addressing a press conference Saturday in Monrovia, Minister Ngafuan said the report alluded to by the media was gathered from previous audit conducted during the administration of his predecessor, Dr. Antoinette Sayeh. Min. Ngafuan said Liberia is operating on 12 triggers, which have to be implemented by a host of Government Institutions and not for an individual to rush into the coffers of the country to use tax payers' money. He said the twelve triggers are to prepare a full Poverty Reduction Strategy through a participatory process and implement satisfactorily its recommended actions for at least one year. The Finance Minister also said the country is not retrogressing when it comes to accountability, transparency among others. The Minister noted that he will not be teaching auditing at the University of Liberia and turn his back to what he is teaching. Minister Ngafuan stated also that he will never allow himself to be a thief, or form part of thieves, but rather do everything possible in the interest of the Liberian people. Minister Ngafuan further stated that the statement published in the Front Page News Paper Friday under the caption ""Mess at Finance Ministry"" is worrisome, and as such he wants reporters to double check their stories before publication. He said reporters should exhibit their professionalism so as to avoid future embarrassments. He said, he will not allow himself to be a part of thievery attitudes, because he does not want to serve the Liberian people with dishonesty. The Minister also made reference to a publication in the media that the HIPC which is intended to establish whether Liberia has a sound and responsible financial management policies as a way of protecting state resources from plunder and abuse as was done in the past. On the contrary, the Minister said, audit has uncovered a lot of mess which include massive abuse of ghost transactions, ghost workers including others unwholesome financial practices bent on defrauding the Liberian people of thousands of United States dollars."23,New Democrat (Monrovia),4/22/10,President Passes Corruption Ball to PUL,,LIBERIA (94%); UNITED STATES (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,22-Apr-10,,199  words,POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); SUITS & CLAIMS (87%); JOURNALISM (78%); BRIBERY (78%); LITIGATION (74%); PRESS CONFERENCES (73%); WRITERS (73%); LAWYERS (71%); HUMAN RIGHTS (69%); BANKING LAW (68%); BANKING & FINANCE (68%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (51%) Liberia; Press and Media; Crime and Corruption,"President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf on Tuesday boomeranged a reporter's question on escalating corruption in the country to the Press Union of Liberia, which received US$100,000 from her last year to build its headquarters, but the project remains at a standstill.

The current PUL administration and its predecessor are now locked in a lawsuit over the use of the money, with allegations that former PUL leaders misused the money. Reports say that President Sirleaf's brother-in-law Estrada Bernard, who is also her legal counsel, allegedly disbursed the US$100,000 to former PUL President George Barpeen in violation of PUL's constitution and banking regulation. There are other reports that former President Charles Taylor offered a similar amount to the PUL for the same project but there is no result.

The sane are usually attracted by other things other than power,"" said David Brin, the 20th century American fiction writer. One year after the inception of the inclusive Government, the moderate gains that have been achieved are on the brink of going down the drain because of corruption. There seems to be no willpower on the part of Government or the political parties to apply chemotherapy to the growing cancer. Forget about politics and the so-called outstanding issues. Corruption has become endemic and so entrenched into the nation's bloodstream that it has become the biggest threat to the country's survival. The major problem we now have is that when people talk about corruption, be it politicians or the common man in the street, it is as if it is some theoretical issue and not something that is happening under our noses. Corruption has led to cronyism and the growth of a criminal state, whose future is but gloomy. This is the tragedy of Zimbabwe today. It is also common cause that the so-called independent media, for political expediency, have by and large ignored these acts of corruption. After having for so long presented themselves as watchdogs, reporting acts of alleged corruption by Zanu-PF officials, they have largely turned a blind eye to the scourge, as the MDC officials continue to abuse their positions of authority. This hypocrisy is understandable, for any negative coverage may derail the regime change agenda and offend their funders. MDC-T spokesperson Nelson Chamisa confirmed that some ministers, councillors and legislators were under investigation for engaging in corrupt activities. He, however, refused to disclose the names of the people under probe, but said there would not be any sacred cows to demonstrate the party's zero tolerance of corruption. Chamisa was earlier on quoted acknowledging that the MDC-T had ""rotten apples"" in their basket. He probably failed to notice that the whole basket has become rotten and needed to be thrown into the rubbish bin. As a party ""we are a party of excellence. Transparency, accountability and good governance are part of our fabric,"" he said. ""We expect these from our Prime Minister, from our ministers and from, most importantly, our councils."" However, the party's actions to date have contradicted what they are saying in public. It would seem that they are paying lip service to corruption. While they are quick to point out alleged Zanu-PF misdemeanours, they seem reluctant to deal with even reported acts of corruption from within the party. ""Is this the new beginning that they promised us? They are surely excelling in corruption and misgovernance,"" said a dejected MDC sympathiser. For a party that promised ""a new beginning"", and economic emancipation, it is busy eroding the base created by those who fought for the independence of this country. Chamisa said the party's biggest challenge at the moment was to deal with corruption and plans were underway to weed out those people involved in any corrupt activity, irrespective of their position in the party. ""Unfortunately, others are now falling for this culture of corruption. Our crusade to get rid of bad apples is unstoppable. There will be no sacred cows -- this goes for ministers, MPs, councillors,"" he said. It remains to be seen whether the party will carry out its threat to dismiss the hordes of affected officials. The irony was lost on the MDC-T leaders, with their multiple properties both in the country and outside and top-of-the-range vehicles that the ordinary person can only dream of. This contradiction symbolises the MDC-T today. It is the outcome of a double think of the so-called ""national democratic revolution"" gone awry. But it is not hard to understand Chamisa's publicity stunt. The MDC-T's local government leadership has been accused of ineptitude. Thus the party has had to resort to such theatrics to respond to the accusations that it is blatantly corrupt. Growing reports of corruption by MDC-T councillors have further raised questions about the willingness on the part of the MDC-T to curb the scourge. One would have thought that the party, as per their election manifesto, would have breathed a ""new way"" of doing things in the governance of local authorities. The authorities are agreed that all is not well but it is the indifference to the acts of corruption that has left more questions than answers. ""A lot of our councillors have breached the citizen's charter and flouted tender procedures we need to nip this corruption demon,"" said Chamisa. The party tried to pacify the nation by instituting a commission of inquiry led by Tapiwa Mashakada to probe the allegations. While the ""commission's findings"", are not yet out, at least for now, the party has tried to defend the indefensible by trying to portray the alleged perpetrators as victims of political chicanery by Zanu-PF. Why would a political party or anybody for that matter establish a commission of inquiry to protect from scrutiny those nobs that have used their political influences to enrich themselves? Trying to gloss over the acts of corruption by going public about instituting a commission of inquiry, whose findings remain a mystery, does not instill confidence in the people. Trying to apportion blame and claiming conspiracy theories does not help either. Reports of corruption within the party, save for the dismissal of the Chitungwiza councillors, who were dismissed for refusing to carry out a corrupt directive, i.e. imposing an outsider to become mayor of the town, have largely gone unchecked. Millions of party funds are said to have been looted by known culprits both in the United Kingdom and Zimbabwe. The party's director of elections, Denis Murira, is said to have fleeced the party of thousands of dollars and was rewarded with a senior post in Government. The question that needs answers is: Can such people be trusted to lead the country? Are their promises to deal with corruption a political gimmick? There is need for self-introspection amongst Zimbabweans as the country is faced with a bigger threat. Very soon many people might find themselves without houses and other property, falling prey to the marauding breed of new politicians, who are using their positions to fleece the public."29,The Informer (Monrovia),5/10/10,"Supreme Court Warns Reporters Against Corruption, Partiality",,LIBERIA (94%); UNITED STATES (92%),Newspaper,Marcus Zoleh,ENGLISH,,,10-May-10,,319  words,LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (91%); SUPREME COURTS (90%); INTERVIEWS (78%); CONSULTING SERVICES (73%); CORRUPTION (70%); COMPUTER SOFTWARE (53%) Liberia; Press and Media; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"The Supreme Court of Liberia has endorsed the introduction of three newly trained court reporters into the judicial system of the country. Senior Associate Justice Francis Korkpor said the insertion of the new reporters will immensely assist in the timely conduct of court proceedings. Florence Harris, Fayiah Tambah, and Roselyn Simpson were selected among dozens of applicants, after passing a detailed test and interview. They completed a six-week intensive training in Atlanta, USA. The training prepared them for pioneering the high advanced equipment in Liberia's court. The new technology works to allow the court reporters to produce a precise verbatim record of legal proceedings. As the court reporter hears the words spoken by each person in the courtroom, he/she repeats those words very carefully into a microphone. These sounds are automatically translated into text on the screen by computer software, and each person in the courtroom is also recorded. This allows the reporter to later re-listen to proceedings and make any corrections. Justice Korkpor urged the reporters to 'demonstrate complete professionalism' in their reportorial duties in to uphold the credibility of the judicial system and also pave the way for the training of more court reporters. For her part, Justice Gladys Johnson warned the reporters against 'partial reporting', terming it as 'corruption' on the part of the reporters in the judiciary. The Country Representative of the International Legal Assistance Consultancy ((ILAC), Mr. Michael R. Euwall, told the reporters that his organization decided to introduce such new idea into the Liberian judicial system, due to delays in court proceedings. According to him, such delays are responsible for the over crowdedness of courts dockets with numbers of cases which said needed to be dealt with in shorter time. He put the cost of the training of the three reporters at US$120,000."30,The Herald (Harare),5/14/10,MPs Must Partake in Anti-Corruption Drive [opinion],,ZIMBABWE (94%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,14-May-10,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (79%)",1184  words,CORRUPTION (93%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (79%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (78%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (78%); CITY GOVERNMENT (77%); SMUGGLING (76%); INVESTIGATIONS (75%); POLITICAL PARTIES (74%); POLITICS (71%); EVICTION (63%); INFRASTRUCTURE (50%) Zimbabwe; Crime and Corruption,"CORRUPTION has been cited as one of the cancers that have bled the country, impacting on economic growth. The Zimbabwe Chapter of the African Parliamenta-rians Network Against Corruption issued a statement castigating the scourge of corruption and called on relevant authorities to institute measures that would compel public officials to declare their assets and business interests. The grouping is a voluntary body of legislators from all political parties in Parliament and is an affiliate of the African Chapter that was founded in 1999. The practice to disclose assets has been adopted by a number of countries as they attempt to stem abuse of public resources. Some may question the benefit of such disclosure. While I acknowledge that corruption is impossible to completely eradicate, the disclosure of assets and other business interests is important as it helps in tracking any other deals an individual in a senior position may enter into. It also helps even those individuals in high positions from being viewed as corrupt when they could have acquired their wealth legitimately. While Government has initiated a number of measures to deal with this menace, a lot can still be done to safeguard resources. The call by APNAC has, therefore, come at an opportune time. As a country, we are currently in the process of writing a new constitution and we should therefore include provisions that ensure that public resources are safeguarded. However, declaration of assets should not only be confined to public officials. I believe even those executives especially in public listed companies should also be compelled to do the same. There is a general belief that corruption is in the public sector but the private sector has also contributed to the abuse of resources. A few years ago, Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Governor, Dr Gideon Gono said the country had lost approximately US$2 billion through smuggling of diamonds. Other precious minerals like gold are also being smuggled daily while the country continues to suffer from inadequate funds to finance a number of public works programmes. All these nefarious activities have cost the country dearly and have to be stopped. The call by the legislators could also not have come at a better time given the ongoing constitution-making process. We need to ensure proper use of resources is enshrined in the new constitution. Most local authorities have been afflicted by this scourge with councillors in some urban areas allocating or illegally acquiring stands for themselves, flouting tender procedures, evicting poor residents from council accommodation and so on. In some countries, abuse of public resources attracts heavy penalties and I think we should be moving in that direction to discourage such crimes. We also have to ensure that the police are adequately resourced to investigate corruption. Corruption is white-collar crime that requires expertise to expose. Zimbabwe should, therefore, invest heavily in this fight. So when the Anti-Corruption Commission is constituted, we hope it will work hard to curtail the cancer. However, the fight against corruption should not be used to settle political scores and then degenerate into a farce like what the Scorpions of South Africa ended up doing. The South African special police unit was disbanded after accusations that it was being used to settle political scores. Parliamentarians should be actively involved in the fight against corruption and APNAC should be commended. Last week, the Zimbabwe Power Company, a subsidiary of Zesa Holdings responsible for electricity generation said it would activate two more units at Hwange Power Station a situation that would increase output from 200MW to 500MW. However, soon after that announcement, power cuts appeared to have worsened and the question that begs an answer is whether the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mines and Energy was misled. The increase in generation at Hwange should have brought some relief to the cuts that we have been experiencing but this has not come to be. While we acknowledge the challenges that Zesa is facing, it does not help however, that increase at Hwange is not enough. What is baffling is that the frequency of the power cuts seems to have increased following the announcement. A number of people have been calling complaining that the information that ZPC gave was misleading, so I hope they will clear the air and tell us what is really happening. Another disturbing matter concerning another subsidiary of Zesa, this time the Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company, is the switching off of power to Shabanie that caused flooding and damaged equipment worth over US$450 million. The same fate also befell a number of mines. While it is a fact that electricity cannot be obtained for free, it becomes another thing to destroy equipment worth close to half a billion over bills. It is shocking insensitivity and lack of appreciation of national resources. Zesa also owes a number of institutions but I don't think there is anyone who has threatened to shut down its plants over debts. In this instance, there is no one who benefited because valuable equipment has been lost while Shabanie Mine's ability to pay its debts is next to zero since its source of income has been closed. It is going to be very expensive to resuscitate the company and the costs are also great in that a number of people were made redundant. The environment that we are operating under is abnormal, therefore it does not make sense to take a drastic measure like the one taken by ZETDC when everyone is struggling to make ends meet. The Secretary in the Ministry of Regional Integration and International Co-operation, Mr Tedious Chifamba said South Africa appeared not keen on setting up a One-Stop Border post at Beitbridge similar to the one set up at Chirundu with Zambia last year. A number of observers have said the One-Stop Border concept is a positive development as it reduces bureaucracy and congestion at border posts. This is because all immigration procedures from countries involved would be done under one roof. We hope that with further engagements, the South Africans will change their minds on that one. We also hope that talks to ensure that Zimbabweans with the new Temporary Travel Document are allowed access into South Africa will be completed soon to prevent continued inconveniences being experienced by the public. Registrar General Mr Tobaiwa Mudede said Zimbabwe did all procedures internationally recognised when it introduced the new travelling document. He said he was baffled why South Africa was the only country rejecting the document. Lastly, former deputy clerk of Parliament, Ms Helen Dingani, was recently appointed to take a similar position in the Pan African Parliament. This is another feather added to Zimbabwe's cap and recognition of the country's intellectual prowess. There are a number of eminent Zimbabweans that have been honoured to take up important posts in various international bodies and we thank Ms Dingani for continuing to make us proud. We wish her the best in her new position at PAP."31,Concord Times (Freetown),5/17/10,Tejan-Cole's Resignation And the Complexities of Corruption [opinion],,SIERRA LEONE (97%); AFRICA (94%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%),Newspaper,Muctaru Wurie,ENGLISH,,,17-May-10,,3058  words,CORRUPTION (90%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (87%); TRENDS (78%); APPOINTMENTS (73%); LAWYERS (63%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (60%) Sierra Leone; Crime and Corruption,"Back in 2002, a summit of the African Union on corruption clearly highlighted just how serious this evil is within African societies. The statistics for the cost of corruption to the continent was an estimated 148 billion dollars annually. In Sierra Leone, the legacy of corruption had already seen the Athens of West Africa become the laughing stock of the world. A country that was once the bedrock of British colonial rule in the sub region, wherein the bureaucracy was prided as one of the best in the entire British colonial empire, was surely taking a downward trend. By mid 1970s, that positive reputation had already slipped off and by the 80s the saying ""Usai den tie cow na dae e dae eat"", was already a common adage. And as the late Professor  Akintola Wise put it in a paper presentation on the socio-political history of Sierra Leone; a society that once valued virtue and scholarly achievements now tend to have lost it completely by the late 80s as the widespread maxim then indicate; ""Den say Bailor Barrie, u say Davidson Nicol."" At the end of war, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission noted that one of the war's main causes had been the rampant corruption that had infested every level of government in the preceding decades. If Sierra Leone was to avoid a repeat of the 1990s, corruption was the biggest vice to be eradicated. Yet even after the commission published its conclusion in 2004, Sierra Leone's post-conflict government is still struggling to solve this ever growing problem. Inaugurating the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) on February 6, 2000, then president Kabba told the country, ""My government and the ordinary people of Sierra Leone now have a new war to wage. This is the war against corruption. And in this fight, nobody will be above the law, including myself."" Ten years after that epoch-making statement there is no doubt that corruption is still an entrenched menace in Sierra Leone today. In the two years after its launching, ACC statistics showed the cases investigated by the Commission paint a picture of a country rotten with corruption. By 2002, the ACC had investigated 500 cases and submitted its findings to the Justice Ministry with recommendations that it follow up. The snag there as many pointed then was that only the justice minister can charge cases of corruption. By force of the constitution, only he can decide whether to prosecute or not to prosecute. However, now that the 2008 ACC Act empowers the commission to use the shortcut option of bypassing the law officers department, (not only can the ACC investigate corruption, as before; it can also now launch prosecutions on its own, without having to refer cases to the  attorney-general, a political appointee.) On the backdrop of the resignation of ACC boss, Abdul Tejan-Cole, does his resignation indicate something much deeper? How has the fight against corruption gone? Is it that our country has been doomed to live with corruption? Is it that our political leaders lack the political will to swallow the bitter pill and enforce a robust anti-corruption campaign or is it that we are making an exaggeration and corruption is not the real issue here? Desmond Johnson, acting director of public education - an external outreach of the ACC - who defines corruption as not having any clear-cut definition, but they see it as misusing offices for personal gains and also as when someone fails to act or act in an inappropriate manner believes that dishonesty is the main problem: ""It is affecting our socio economic development and in the ACC we believe that it is a fight that we can only succeed in if we have the support and cooperation of the general public."" When I put it to the ACC PR chief whether the government has genuine intentions towards the fight against corruption he replied; ""I believe so, if not the government would not have the commission existing."" Desmond Johnson cited the ACC Act 2008 as an instance to back up his claim that the government is serious about the fight against corruption. He referred to the ACC Act 2000 as 'very weak' and said the 2008 Act now gives them more strength to fight corruption. Is the ACC equipped and using the right approaches to fight corruption and are we not seeing the same trend of those found in ACC net? According to Mr Johnson, the ACC is doing its best and it is using the three pronged approach, namely punitive, which involves investigating and prosecuting alleged acts of corruption. The preventive and education approach. Contrary to what many believe he claimed the ACC is daily carrying out intelligence investigations and prosecutions; ""We don't make  our intelligence works public and we have a proactive and intelligence wing that secretly goes out there but you cannot see them."" Interestingly, Mr Johnson told me that although the ACC was able to convict 11 people in 2009 the greatest challenge to the institution is public support; he thinks the ACC needs more support and cooperation from the general public. He also pointed out what many fear it might be the stumbling block to minimising corruption. ""We need logistical support; the commission works throughout the country and if we are to succeed logistics like vehicles and other gadgets are vital. Finance and office is another problem,"" he said. Whilst the ACC boasts its success stories such as raising the public's awareness of the dangers of corruption and recovering billions of Leones for the government, David Tam-Baryoh - a political commentator in Sierra Leone said that the issue about whether the fight against corruption is being done in the proper way should be assessed on the amount sacred cows the current and previous governments have, something he humorously said he is not prepared to enter. But Charles Mambu, director of the coalition of civil society told Sierra Eye; ""A fish is a fish, whether it is big or small. If the ACC wants to succeed in its fight against corruption, we believe it should investigate and prosecute any sacred cow or special personality but the best option  for the ACC is that it should set an example at all levels of corruption; that is the best way it can minimise the evil,"" said Charles Mambu. The civil society leader also criticised the ACC and said it should be 'more open and transparent'. To Charles Mambu, his greatest fear is that of government interference; ""We will continue to talk to the government not to interfere into any of the functions and activities of the ACC. We will also talk to ACC officials not to allow themselves to be used by selfish politicians and members of the public because of the money or power they wield."" He believes that leaders should be an example for progressive change and that the fight against corruption, though not only reliant on them, should be key in enabling its success. The Kenyan Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, Wangari Maathai in her book ""The Challenge for Africa"", powerfully argues that the continent is in urgent need of a revolution in leadership and ""those in power - the presidents, prime ministers, politicians, and other elites - have to recognize that the way Africa has been conducting its affairs of state has neither protected nor promoted the welfare of the continent's citizens nor provided for the long term growth and stability of its nations. According to James Taiwo Cullen, a broadcaster for VOH FM 96.2 radio station, the greed and selfishness of government officials is to blame for high-level corruption in Sierra Leone. But meagre salaries within the civil service--which can be as low as US$1 a day--may have as much to do with the problem. This brings us to the point of poverty and corruption, in the latest edition of Development Drums, titled DOES CORRUPTION CAUSE POVERTY, OR IS IT THE OTHER WAY ROUND? by Daniel Kaufmann and Mushtaq Khan. Both authors argue that though poverty and corruption come from quite different  points of view, there is quite a lot of convergence between them. They agree that there is much more corruption in poor countries than in rich countries; that nobody should put too much faith in econometrics to decide whether corruption is a reason that poor countries remain poor; and that you do not fight poverty by only fighting corruption. But whereas Daniel Kaufmann believes that you have to tackle corruption to create the conditions for markets to work and to create economic growth and prosperity, Mushtaq Khan believes that you should focus on policies to promote growth and that a certain amount of corruption is an inevitable (albeit undesirable) corollary of the transition to a capitalist economy. Most Westerners they say believe that corruption is one of the most important reasons why poor countries remain poor; and yet a lot of them working in development seem to be willing to tolerate some corruption as an inevitable fact of life in poor  countries. According to a Human Right Watch briefing paper on Sierra Leone, petty corruption, extortion, and bribe-taking, particularly by police officers or low ranking officials, is rampant. Money has to change hands in order to secure entrance for children into public school, receive treatment in a public clinic, obtain a permit, authorisation, or letter from a ministry, or even file a police report. Corruption has historically bought the support of both the police and the army, making them subject to political interference and undermining their duty to protect. Personal gain through corruption remains the primary motivation for those entering the civil service..... the efforts of those seeking redress through the legal system are often frustrated by  corruption within the very system designed to combat it. So is it a way of life for many in Sierra Leone. Mabinty Sillah residing at Moyiba in the hilly side of Freetown is a very mother of five, struggling to send his children to school and provide them with basic meals but she was forced to bribe as she went for her national ID card at the National Registration Secretariat; ""I didn't even have enough money to feed my children that day, I had no option but to pay a bribe of Le 5,000 to officials filling our forms. Those who didn't comply were made to endlessly sit down and wait. I needed the ID to enter into the micro credit scheme, so I had to ensure I got my ID otherwise I will not be considered for credit,"" said Mabinty who told me that because of that bribe she could not feed her children on  that day. A young graduate, Andrew Conteh believes that ordinary Sierra Leoneans should resist the temptation of corruption and stop bribing public officials; ""In the words of Elbert Hubbard ""All that is necessary for evil to succeed is that good men do nothing. Therefore we should openly oppose and expose anyone who encourages any form of bribery. We are ourselves aiding corruption in our little corners and at the end blaming government for all our problems,"" he said. Whilst leaders such as Tejan Kabbah in the past have stated that lower salaries should not be the reason for the high corruption in our society, many ordinary Sierra Leoneans I spoke to believe any effort to stamp out corruption should be matched up with what some described as 'decent salaries' for lowly paid government officials. ""I don't care what any moralist or man of God tells me, but I know that you don't expect a man to be free of corruption when his salary is so meagre but handles millions of daily transactions. Except the government tries to augment the salaries of workers, then we are only fooling ourselves,"" said a civil servant who prefers anonymity. Another civil servant tells Sierra Eye that despite the fact that he is a  Master's holder he is ashamed to say his salary to his wife; ""My colleagues in the private sector earn five times more that what the government pays me and yet every emphasis is now being laid on corruption and they are ignoring a grave problem that is threatening our livelihood, paltry salaries."" Is the ACC being used as a tool to stifle opposition and other dissent in the state? At the initial setting up of the commission some Sierra Leonean journalists and politicians claim the ACC is nothing but a political tool used to hunt opponents of the government. Victor Foh, now the ruling party secretary for the incumbent All Peoples Congress, said back in 2000; ""The ACC is an albatross and a tool to grab those who do not see things the way the government sees them."" A signal to that criticism came to the fore back in November 2, 2001; acting on direct orders from then president Kabbah, the ACC began investigating outspoken critic, For di People editor Paul Kamara for tax evasion. Kamara, who has been a blunt critic of the Kabbah government, was eventually cleared of the charges, but the investigation sent a clear message then. Sierra Leone still has a long way to go in its battle against corruption. That officials from the government waging the battle against corruption are themselves corrupt compounds the problem for the ACC investigators, who must depend on the government's good graces to continue their work. As a senior British diplomat stationed in Sierra Leone put it, ""A greater percentage of the president's men are from the old block, and this is where corruption breeds in this country. In order for government to win the uphill battle against corruption,"" he says, ""The president must continue to distance himself from the older politicians who have had their hands in every political pile since Sierra Leone gained independence in 1961."" Clare Short, former British Development minister, described corruption as endemic and ingrained within both the public and private sectors in Sierra Leone. ""It permeates all levels of government and most business transactions. Scandals involving the looting of state coffers and development aid are commonplace."" However, African economy expert, Dambisa Moyo in his work titled; Why Foreign Aid Is Hurting Africa, stated that money from rich countries has actually trapped many African nations in a cycle of corruption, slower economic growth and poverty. Cutting off the flow would be far more beneficial, and many times he pointed out when the west talks about corruption in Africa it usually refers to huge  mineral monies or aid monies. Citing World Bank figures he referred to nations such as Rwanda, Somalia, Mali, Chad, Mauritania and Sierra Leone, countries which from 1970 to 2002, have had over 70% of total government spending coming from foreign aid but still struggling with problems such as corruption that hampers growth. So is there the feeling within the ruling elite that aid money is just money from abroad and not the people's money? In a presentation titled GOVERNANCE, DEMOCRACY AND DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA: A CULTURAL APPROACH, presented by: The Ghana Center for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana) corruption is identified as a universal problem, with complex causes. ""Its net effect is commonly regarded as negative for all societies, especially developing countries. It leads to economic inefficiencies; distorts development; inhibits long-term foreign and domestic investments; misallocates talents to rent seeking and away from productive activities; induces wrong sectoral priorities and technological choices."" What are the solutions to corruption in our societies? The paper states that there should be a creation and sustenance of a low corruption environment, and it requires the establishment of effective mechanisms of discovery and punishment. An institutional framework conducive to fighting corruption must promote easy oversight, assessment of wrongdoing and punishment for those convicted of wrongdoing. Equally important, the institutions established to oversee, expose and punish corruption must be insulated from the very actors they are supposed to be controlling (Diamond 1998). ""Here too, we must build institutions for preventing, detecting and punishing corruption instead of relying on individual morality,"" it  concluded. As challenging as the fight against corruption may be, despite all the impediments faced by the ACC in Sierra Leone, there has been some positive features that could be signs that all is not lost. Twenty-seven public officials have been indicted for corruption in the past year or so, including judges and the heads of the post office and the national broadcasting service.  The number of prosecutions has soared from nine in 2008 to 29 in 2009. The ACC has clawed back around 3 billion leones in assets from those found guilty of corruption. Such changes brought some joy to now resigned Abdul Tejan-Cole who said they have given the ACC 'more teeth'. This will tempt one to further ask the question, do we need  more reform in the state to enhance the fight against corruption. Because it is certain that no matter how capable and robust an ACC commissioner is, there are extra dynamics to ensure success in the fight against graft in Sierra Leone. In a November 2009 article in the Economist Magazine titled, Sierra Leone's corruption problem, A mortal enemy, the ACC was praised for its lead on a very tough challenge in fighting corruption in Sierra Leone as indicated in the annual Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International, a Berlin-based lobby, which showed Sierra Leone steadily climbing up the rankings, albeit only to number 146 out of the 180 countries surveyed. The magazine hailed Abdul Tejan-Cole for introducing a system whereby every public official must declare all his or her assets and also for persuading parliament to change the law governing the ACC's operation in the ACC Act of 2008. Abdul Tejan-Cole clearly set a legacy at the ACC that can be hard to emulate, he was like a radical outsider calling for what many in state establishments will see as drastic measures. He called for the repeal of the criminal and seditious libel laws; he also called for the enactment of an access to information act among others. Although he did not clearly state any reason for his resignation, it was very clear for all to see that Abdul Tejan-Cole, a man who had a very strict disciplinary record was certainly put off by political pressures from some sacred cows. But whosoever will replace him have a very huge task to carry on, it is clear for all to see now that the ACC position is one of the most challenging assignments in the land."32,Concord Times (Freetown),5/17/10,APC - the Inconsistency in Fighting Corruption [opinion],,SIERRA LEONE (94%),Newspaper,Alusine Sesay,ENGLISH,,,18-May-10,,580  words,CORRUPTION (97%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (79%); INVESTIGATIONS (77%); POLITICS (72%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (72%); FISHERIES ADMINISTRATION (71%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (71%); NATURAL RESOURCES (71%); FISHERIES (68%) Sierra Leone; Crime and Corruption,"Corruption is a social enemy that is responsible for the backwardness of Sierra Leone. Each and every Sierra Leonean has suffered one way or the other from the ills corruption. The 11-year rebel war in the country was largely as a result of this social ill referred to as corruption. With the help of the TRC report after the war, there was a general call to set up a commission to champion the fight against graft. One would therefore commend the SLPP government under the able leadership of Alhaji Dr. Ahmad Tejan Kabbah for setting up the Anti-Corruption Commission, an independent body to fight this social enemy, though it was not given much power. When Ernest Bai Koroma assumed power in 2007, he declared zero tolerance for corruption. In view of this, he helped to strengthen the Anti-Corruption Commission by giving it prosecutorial powers. Initially some public officials, including the former Health minister, were investigated, prosecuted, and convicted by the Anti-Corruption Commission. This however earned President Koroma praise in and outside the country. But the case of the former Minister of Fisheries and Marine Resources has started raising many questions in the minds of Sierra Leoneans as to how consistent is the APC government to fighting corruption. The resignation of the Anti-Corruption Commissioner, Abdul Tejan-Cole as a result of alleged government interference into the case of Haja Afsatu Kabba is indeed a slap in the face of the APC government. This has somehow justified suggestion by some sections of the media that Afsatu Kabba is a sacred cow and a strong member of the APC who can commit the worst crime and get away with it. Why is it that the APC youth leader is in solidarity with Afsatu Kabba while being tried in the court? One would conclude that he is being sent under the guise of government solidarity. One thing I want the APC government to realize is that they are meddling with the people's power and Sierra Leoneans are no longer prepared to accept any mess from politicians. A source from the Anti-Corruption Commission told this writer that the APC government tried in vain to influence the Commissioner not to charge the case of Afsatu Kabba to court. After failing to influence the Commissioner and the case being charged to court, government was said to have spoon fed some political stooges like the APC youth leader and other mediocre to stage a riot while the case was in progress. It is indeed a big disappointment to the expectations of the people who were hoping the APC would allow the Commission to operate independently so as to nip corruption in the bud. Again, it was revealed that the APC government had called on the Anti-Corruption Commission to relax the procurement law so as to allow them dupe the people of their resources. This is a clear indication that the APC wants to accumulate money for the 2012 elections, which they think perhaps would not go in their favour. Mind you, the APC government must have learnt lessons from the 2007 election when the people played the watermelon politics by receiving money from Berewa and then refusing to cast their votes for him. I'll make bold to tell the APC government that they would be treated likewise if they fail to do what the people want. The APC government should realize that 'what goes around comes around'. Finally, am appealing to the President for him to continue as he started because the whole world is looking forward to him for credible governance."33,Concord Times (Freetown),5/17/10,Tejan-Cole's Resignation And the Complexities of Corruption in Sierra Leone [opinion],,SIERRA LEONE (97%); AFRICA (94%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%),Newspaper,Muctaru Wurie,ENGLISH,,,18-May-10,,3055  words,CORRUPTION (90%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (87%); TRENDS (78%); APPOINTMENTS (73%); LAWYERS (63%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (60%) Sierra Leone,"Back in 2002, a summit of the African Union on corruption clearly highlighted just how serious this evil is within African societies. The statistics for the cost of corruption to the continent was an estimated 148 billion dollars annually. In Sierra Leone, the legacy of corruption had already seen the Athens of West Africa become the laughing stock of the world. A country that was once the bedrock of British colonial rule in the sub region, wherein the bureaucracy was prided as one of the best in the entire British colonial empire, was surely taking a downward trend. By mid 1970s, that positive reputation had already slipped off and by the 80s the saying ""Usai den tie cow na dae e dae eat"", was already a common adage. And as the late Professor Akintola Wise put it in a paper presentation on the socio-political history of Sierra Leone; a society that once valued virtue and scholarly achievements now tend to have lost it completely by the late 80s as the widespread maxim then indicate; ""Den say Bailor Barrie, u say Davidson Nicol."" At the end of war, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission noted that one of the war's main causes had been the rampant corruption that had infested every level of government in the preceding decades. If Sierra Leone was to avoid a repeat of the 1990s, corruption was the biggest vice to be eradicated. Yet even after the commission published its conclusion in 2004, Sierra Leone's post-conflict government is still struggling to solve this ever growing problem. Inaugurating the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) on February 6, 2000, then president Kabba told the country, ""My government and the ordinary people of Sierra Leone now have a new war to wage. This is the war against corruption. And in this fight, nobody will be above the law, including myself."" Ten years after that epoch-making statement there is no doubt that corruption is still an entrenched menace in Sierra Leone today. In the two years after its launching, ACC statistics showed the cases investigated by the Commission paint a picture of a country rotten with corruption. By 2002, the ACC had investigated 500 cases and submitted its findings to the Justice Ministry with recommendations that it follow up. The snag there as many pointed then was that only the justice minister can charge cases of corruption. By force of the constitution, only he can decide whether to prosecute or not to prosecute. However, now that the 2008 ACC Act empowers the commission to use the shortcut option of bypassing the law officers department, (not only can the ACC investigate corruption, as before; it can also now launch prosecutions on its own, without having to refer cases to the attorney-general, a political appointee.)

But whosoever will replace him have a very huge task to carry on, it is clear for all to see now that the ACC position is one of the most challenging assignments in the land."34,New Democrat (Monrovia),5/19/10,"Greaves - ""Corruption a Big Problem """,,LIBERIA (94%); SIERRA LEONE (79%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%); BRAZIL (79%); RUSSIAN FEDERATION (74%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,19-May-10,,719  words,CORRUPTION (90%); PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (90%); IRON MINING (89%); INTERVIEWS (89%); OILSEED PROCESSING (86%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (78%); PETROLEUM REFINERIES (78%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%); NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (77%); CONFLICT MINERALS (74%); TREASON (72%); FOREIGN INVESTMENT (71%); DIAMOND MARKETS (69%); UNEMPLOYED PERSONS (69%); MISC OILSEED PROCESSING (68%); RUBBER & SILICONE (68%); REBELLIONS & INSURGENCIES (67%); CHILD SOLDIERS (66%); WAR CRIMES (66%); EXPORT TRADE (65%); IRON & STEEL MILLS (62%) Liberia; Crime and Corruption,"The dismissed Managing Director of the Liberia Petroleum Refining Corporation (LPRC), Mr. Harry A. Greaves, Jr., has now conceded that ""corruption is a big problem"" in the government hindering development. Mr. Greaves, who rejected similar allegations from the UN Panel of Experts in the past, and suggested that Auditor General John Morlu be charged with treason for reaching similar conclusions, in an interview with Reuters, said Liberia at this moment is not an investor friendly country. ""This is not a very investor-friendly place,"" said Harry Greaves, a local businessman and former head of the national petroleum refinery. ""The legal system is tough, laws are too favourable to debtors, people in government constantly harass business, doing all kinds of inspections. Corruption is a big problem,"" he told Reuters. In its analysis 'Liberia faces hurdles on road to prosperity', Reuters observed: Mining and agriculture companies are preparing to pour billions of dollars into Liberia, but the battle-scarred nation faces big hurdles if it is to turn these investments into a robust post-war recovery. After 15 years of near constant conflict that killed tens of thousands and left its infrastructure in tatters by the time it ended in 2003, the small West African nation is opening up to foreign investment, especially into its rich iron ore deposits. Since coming to power in 2006, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has tried to restore stability and woo investors to a country that was more often associated with child soldiers and conflict diamonds than billion dollar projects. ""This country is so rich,"" national investment commission chairman Richard Tolbert told Reuters in an interview. ""Iron ore, gold, diamonds, rubber, coffee, cocoa, timber, oil palm. We've got the land, labour and natural resources. We need the finance, knowhow and access to markets. Better jump on this band wagon, because it's moving fast."" Top steelmaker ArcelorMittal   have large concessions in Liberia, as does Russia's Severstal . Officials are in talks with Brazilian miner Vale  , the world's biggest iron ore producer. The largest single investment in the country is China Union's $2.6 billion iron ore project, which officially opened towards the end of last month. Asian palm oil companies are seeking plantation concessions in the well watered countryside. Production of rubber, still Liberia's biggest export until iron gets underway, is on the rise. Such things were unthinkable during war-wracked reign of former President Charles Taylor, ousted by rebels in 2003, and now on trial for war crimes in neighbouring Sierra Leone. The numbers look impressive, but transforming Liberia from a broken into a prosperous nation is a huge task. Around three quarters of Liberia's 3.5 million people are unemployed, Tolbert said, and the country is heavily dependent on donor aid to help run almost every aspect of government. Liberia hosts the second largest U.N. peacekeeping mission in Africa, after Democratic Republic of the Congo. U.N. police vehicles ply the streets of Monrovia on routine patrols for which Liberian police lack the resources. Outside the capital, warlords are kept at bay largely by U.N. troops. Diplomats say the mission even helps draft legislation. Few jobs will be created by the iron ore projects. Tolbert estimates each project will create between 2,000 and 3,000 direct jobs, though farming would have more of an impact on employment: a palm oil project signed with Sime Darby will bring 30,000 jobs. Another being negotiated with Indonesia's Golden Agri Resources  would create 40,000. While mining giants have been welcomed, smaller businesses complain of red tape, high taxes, corruption and harassment. Officials say efforts have been made to tackle this, pointing out that registering a business now takes 27 days, instead of 90, and that the nation has been praised by the World Bank for its reforms, moving it up the ease of doing business index to 149th this year from 173rd in 2008. But poor roads and power shortages remain a big deterrent. ""The biggest challenge we have is the cost of electricity, which has made people uncomfortable about business here,"" Deputy Commerce Minister Frederick Norkeh told Reuters. ""But still, the potential is high. We're one of the last frontier markets."""35,The Informer (Monrovia),5/20/10,PIN Vows to Fight Corruption,,LIBERIA (94%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,21-May-10,,338  words,CORRUPTION (95%); RELIGION (90%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (90%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (89%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); FAITH BASED SCHOOLS (77%); PROTESTANTS & PROTESTANTISM (77%); VIRUSES (70%) Liberia; Crime and Corruption,"A local non-governmental organization known as Peace Interaction Network (PIN) yesterday launched its campaign to fight corruption in the Liberian society. The program which was held on the campus of the United Methodist University (UMU) was held under the theme: ""Using the bottom to the level approach in the fight against corruption"". Speaking at the occasion, former Information Minister Rev. Dr. Lawrence Bropleh encouraged students of the school to remain steadfast in the fight against corruption. Dr. Bropleh said corruption is a disease in our society that needs to be eradicated by all cost. According to him, corruption started in Liberia before its birth in 1847 Speaking further, Dr. Bropleh said corruption can be seen in every fabric of the society, including the religious communities. He named commercial honoring programs, Father of the Year, Mother of the Year, Special Brother and Sister that can always take place in religious institutions as areas where religious people carry out corruption. He observed that segregation in families is also a recipe for corruption. Also speaking at the program, the Chairperson of the Liberia Anti Corruption Commission (LACC), Cllr. Frances Johnson-Morris warned against demonizing people who are helping to fight corruption. Cllr. Johnson-Morris said the fight against corruption must be done with justice, equality and fairness without favor. She said despite the LACC's determination to fight corruption, both the Judiciary and Legislative Branches are not cooperating, as evidenced by their failure to declare their assets. She however used the occasion to admonish the student body to encourage their respective lawmakers to declare their assets. For his part, PIN Executive Director, Mr. Emmanuel Gonquoi lauded the students for their participation and promised to extend similar program to every school in the country. He told the well attended gathering that PIN will love to partner with the LACC in the fight against corruption owing to the fact that corruption is deadly virus."36,The Namibian (Windhoek),5/24/10,Namugongo Guilty On Corruption Charges,,NAMIBIA (94%),Newspaper,Werner Menges,ENGLISH,,,24-May-10,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (90%)",679  words,CORRUPTION (91%); MAGISTRATES (90%); SENTENCING (90%); TESTIMONY (90%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (90%); CULTURE DEPARTMENTS (89%); FINES & PENALTIES (89%); LICENSES & PERMITS (88%); GAMING (88%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); TOURISM DEVELOPMENT (78%); TOURISM (78%); JAIL SENTENCING (77%); WITNESSES (77%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (77%); CRIMINAL FINES (77%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (77%); LAWYERS (74%); ARRESTS (72%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (71%); DOCUMENTARY FILMS (61%) Namibia; Crime and Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"FORMER Ministry of Environment and Tourism official Sackey Namugongo became the most high-profile victim of the Anti-Corruption Act to date on Friday, when he was convicted in the Windhoek Regional Court on 19 counts of corruption. At the age of 58, Namugongo should be sent to prison for ten years, Deputy Prosecutor General Orben Sibeya suggested to Magistrate Sarel Jacobs after the magistrate had convicted Namugongo on almost half of the 40 charges he faced. Defence counsel Titus Mbaeva suggested Namugongo should be sentenced to pay a fine. As for Namugongo himself, he continued to insist he was an innocent man when he got his turn to testify in mitigation of sentence. ""I did not receive money from them,"" he said, referring to the string of witnesses who told the court they paid tens of thousands of dollars to him for what they thought would be gambling house licences that would be issued to them. ""I did not commit these crimes,"" Namugongo added. Earlier in his testimony he told the court he did not have words to describe the effect the case in which he has been facing charges since his arrest in mid-September 2006 has been having on him. ""I am rejected, I am condemned, and I live in isolation,"" he told the court. Namugongo also asked the court to sentence him to pay a fine, rather than send him straight to prison. Although he does not have money available to pay a fine with, he is confident that he would be able to raise funds from friends, relatives and comrades, Namugongo said. Magistrate Jacobs postponed the sentencing to June 11. Namugongo pleaded not guilty to 20 counts of corruption and 20 charges of fraud when his trial started on July 1 2008. He was accused of having corruptly received hundreds of thousands of Namibia dollars from people who wanted to apply for gambling house licences that would allow them to operate gambling machines in Namibia. It was alleged that Namugongo, who at the time was the Deputy Director of Gambling, Casinos and Lotteries in the Ministry of Environment and Tourism, received the money from gambling house licence applicants from March to September 2006. This allegedly took place while a freeze on the issuing of such licences was in place. The moratorium has been in force since 1997. In the course of the trial, 17 of these applicants told the court they handed over supposed licence application fees to Namugongo either in cash, or by making deposits into his bank account. Namugongo pocketed a total of N$332 500 in this way, the court heard. In his own testimony Namugongo however denied having received most of these payments. He denied he received any of the cash payments, and only admitted having received three payments, totalling N$43 000, for which documentary proof existed. This money, which was deposited into his bank account, was lent to him, Namugongo claimed. After all of the evidence in the trial had been placed before the court, Sibeya and Mbaeva agreed that the fraud charges in essence were a duplication of the corruption charges. This led to Namugongo's acquittal on all of the counts of fraud. The prosecution did not present evidence on one of the corruption charges, leading to Namugongo's acquittal on that charge as well. Magistrate Jacobs rejected Namugongo's denial that he received cash payments from State witnesses as ""inherently false"". On his claims that the money paid into his bank account were loans from friends who were assisting him in a time of financial need, the magistrate commented: ""The court can find no reason why these good people who voluntarily assisted accused when he needed them will now try to mislead the court to believe that the payments made were for gambling house licences if it were indeed intended for the purposes as explained by the accused."" The magistrate found that Namugongo acted corruptly when he received applications for gambling house licences, issued acknowledgement letters to the applicants and received payments from them while a moratorium on the issuing of licences was in place. Namugongo is remaining free on bail until he is sentenced."37,The Namibian (Windhoek),6/7/10,Corruption Remains Root of Business Evil,,NAMIBIA (90%),Newspaper,Jo-Mar Duddy,ENGLISH,,,9-Jun-10,,252  words,POLLS & SURVEYS (92%); EXECUTIVES (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); STOCK EXCHANGES (72%) Namibia; Crime and Corruption,"""CORRUPTION needs to be addressed - it is overshadowing every deal.""

""The ACC seems to have solved a very low percentage of cases,"" the survey quotes another executive. According to the 2009 survey, released last Thursday, a large number of executives have had direct experience of corruption. The tender process is central to the problem. ""The overall perception of the tender process is fairly negative with a significant majority of respondents believing that the tender process is only sometimes fair and transparent,"" the survey states.

In her inaugural address on January 16, 2006, President Sirleaf declared corruption as a public enemy number one of the government of Liberia. The battle to eradicate corruption has continued, with more people still adamant and deeply involved in the practice. But, speaking at a special cabinet meeting Friday following her return from meeting with President Barack Obama in the United States, President Sirleaf said, ""people who have responsibilities should carry out their responsibilities, for if they don't carry them out, they sabotage the whole government."" According to Dr. Momo Rogers, Director General of the Cabinet, President Sirleaf urged ministers to take the ""hard decisions"" necessary to root out corruption in government. She ordered that ""When you find corrupt individuals in your ministries, you should fire them em-masse,"" She said this would change public perception that the government does not have the ""political will"" to act against corruption. The Liberian leader told members of the cabinet that from now on, when she fires any government official, she will tell the public exactly the reason for which the person is being fired rather than letting the Ministry of Justice determine later what the person is guilty of. She raised qualms with the court system, describing it as very slow and has asked the Ministry of Justice to know whether there was any way to speed up cases of corruption already at the courts without infringing on the rights of the individuals involved in terms of their innocence or guilt. President Sirleaf said the Ministry of Justice has to win more cases to show that the government is serious about fighting fraud and corruption. The government has demonstrated over the past four years its commitment to fighting corruption by putting in place many initiatives, including the GAC and LACC. These measures against corruption are ongoing as evident by the one-day Ethical Leadership Interactive Forum beginning Tuesday, June 8, hosted by the Civil Service Agency (CSA), for members of the Cabinet and selected heads of Government Agencies and Commissions, at the Robert L. Johnson Kendeja Resort."39,The Informer (Monrovia),6/9/10,"U.S.$10,000 Corruption Scheme Bursts at MOF-Ngafuan - More 'Crocodiles' at Finance",,LIBERIA (92%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,10-Jun-10,"MONROVIA, LIBERIA (88%)",1159  words,CORRUPTION (92%); BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (90%); PUBLIC FINANCE (90%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (90%); ARRESTS (90%); BRIBERY (90%); TAX AUTHORITIES (89%); SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES (89%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (89%); TAXES & TAXATION (89%); NATIONAL SECURITY (89%); INTELLIGENCE SERVICES (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (77%); TAX LAW (76%); EVIDENCE (63%); PRESS CONFERENCES (57%) Liberia; Crime and Corruption,"Three officials of the Ministry of Finance are in the custody of the National Security Agency (NSA) after they were caught red-handed in the act of corruption I the tone of US$10,000, Finance Minister Augustine Kpehe Ngafuan told a news conference in Monrovia yesterday. Minister Ngafuan said the three officials (Mr. Dawo Z. Morris, Principal Director Large Tax Division, Madam Brenda Dahn Caine Tax Clearance Supervisor and Mr. Kollie Dougba, Tax Analyst) were arrested in a corruption syndicate that would have robbed the state coffer of at least US$200,000. The disappointed said the individuals, who are among the highest paid staff of the Ministry based on their strategic functions, demanded and accepted a bribe of US$10,000 to perform their official duties, from the Cocopa Rubber Plantation in Nimba County. ""They are undergoing investigations for bribery and economic sabotage and will be dumped out of the ministry to face the law for their action, Ngafuan said. The Finance Minister related that circumstances leading to the arrest began on Friday, June 4, when he was contacted by a senior official of the Cocopa Rubber Plantation that the arrested employees of the Ministry of Finance were soliciting a US$10,000 bribe in exchange for a downward adjustment of Cocopa's ""tax liability"" from US$229,394.21 to US$25,989. ""My initial reaction"" Minister Ngafuan said, ""was that of consternation and the urge to take immediate drastic actions against those concerned. However, considering previous incidents wherein individuals we dismissed for criminal behaviors obtained security clearances and rulings compelling us to reinstate them for lack of sufficient evidence, I had second thoughts and opted for a situation wherein they will be booked red-handed."" He said he therefore suggested to the Cocopa official for them to enlist the expertise of the National Security Agency as part of a ""sting operation"". The company, through its Chief Accountant and the Superintendent, and, with the prior understanding and endorsement of the NSA, agreed to provide the US$10,000 to facilitate the transaction, he explained. Upon being told that the company was prepared to pay the bribe, Mr. Morris, Madam Cain and Mr. Dogba reduced the tax penalty from $229,394.21 to $25,989 at the detriment of the Liberian government and people. ""Having been informed that the US$10,000 was ready for payment, Mr. Dawo Morris suggested that the two parties meet in one of the bathrooms on the 3rd Floor of the Ministry of Finance. The bathroom is located in an area that was formerly used by the Large Tax Division, but is currently undergoing renovation. Unlike other parts of the MOF Building this area is relatively isolated and free of human traffic,"" the Minister stated. The Minister said at the appointed moment, Mr. Morris personally appeared and received the amount of US$10,000 which he put into the right front pocket of his trousers, and in what amounts to ""criminal kindness"", Morris returned US$500 to the company representatives (NSA operative) as a goodwill token for paying the requested amount. The company representative left and in a very short space of time, as pre-arranged with the NSA, Mr. Morris was arrested by security officers who had been given prior tip-off of the entire operation. Brenda Dahn Caine and Kollie Dougba were later arrested on the premises of the Ministry of Finance. ""I am awaiting the full and official report from the National Security Agency, which will lead to the dismissal and/or contract termination of the three individuals involved pending prosecution,"" the saddened Minister vowed. Minister told journalists that the solicitation of bribe and the arrested of those involved have both its positive and negative dimensions. On the positive side, he said, it once again reaffirms the stance of his administration that he will not tolerate corruption or anybody who acts corruptly at the Ministry of Finance. Ngafuan: ""This is the vow I made when I took over the administration of this Ministry almost two years ago. And as I said then, and I will reaffirm here, the Ministry of Finance I was inheriting was like a river of crocodiles that appeared calm on the surface but very dangerous underneath."" ""So I promised that I would jar the river so that the crocodiles could be exposed and fearlessly confronted. This has been my mission since, and this will continue to be my mission, no matter how powerful the crocodiles are,"" the Minister noted. The Minister reaffirmed that he will fight fiercely and relentlessly to make the Ministry of Finance increasingly uninhabitable for these beastly and dangerous creatures. ""The controls we are putting into place and our openness in dealing with tax payers have brought up these three culprits from the deep river of bribery."" He said another positive note is that the incident shows what happens when businesses and other taxpayers are willing to cooperate in the fight against corruption and graft. ""The three tax collectors would not have been caught, maybe not so soon, if Cocopa Management had succumbed to these unwholesome advances from staff of the Ministry of Finance."" Instead, he said, they acted like good corporate citizen and reported the matter, not because they wanted their tax penalty waived, but because they wanted to ensure that whatever they paid was just and fair. ""I therefore call on all persons and business entities to resist any staff and/or official of the Ministry of Finance who demand bribe as a condition for executing his/her duty, whether at the ports, at the border posts, in their offices or anywhere else,"" Minister Ngafuan pleaded. The negative dimension of the development, Mr. Ngafuan explained is the fact that the individuals involved were among the well remunerated in order to bolster their ability to withstand such temptations. ""Beside"" Ngafuan went on, ""Mr. Dawo Morris was competitively recruited as Tier 1 Senior Executive Service (SES) person and assigned to the Ministry of Finance, given his credentials which included among other things, being one of the authors of the Liberia Revenue Code of 2000 and a university lecture in taxation. That he could be involved in such a scandal is very disappointing, to say the least."" We will continue to take a host of measures to prevent fraud.... If I receive credible information that any of my employees, Director, Assistant Ministers and Deputy Ministers are involved in corrupt behavior, I will take appropriate action,"" the Minister vowed and said: ""Similarly, if anyone has any information of my involvement in corrupt practices, please do not hesitate to inform the Liberia Anti Corruption Commission, the Ministry of Justice and the President."" He then announced the following hotlines that can be used by anybody who possesses information on the untoward behavior of the Ministry of Finance staff.: 02 42 0000 1 - Direct line to the Office of the Minister of Finance, 06 808 654 and 06808655."40,The Herald (Harare),6/11/10,Chitungwiza Councillors Cleared of Corruption,,ZIMBABWE (93%),Newspaper,Michael Chideme,ENGLISH,,,11-Jun-10,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (79%)",618  words,CORRUPTION (92%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); DISMISSALS (90%); CITY GOVERNMENT (90%); CITY LIFE (89%); MAYORS (89%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (89%); CITIES (89%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (89%); ELECTIONS (79%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (79%); APPOINTMENTS (77%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (75%); LAND USE PLANNING (75%); HUMAN RESOURCES (74%); NATURAL RESOURCES (74%); CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (72%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (69%); ELECTION AUTHORITIES (65%) Zimbabwe; Crime and Corruption,"Government has absolved 20 MDC-T Chitungwiza councillors fired by the party for alleged corruption of any wrongdoing. However, one councillor, Tineyi Kanyama, was fired for abuse of office. The two Zanu-PF councillors, Darlington Nota and Godwell Mafuratidze, who are part of the council were also cleared. Government also cleared special interest councillors Brighton Chirongwe and Tichaona Chapfika. Kanyama joins two others_ former mayor Israel Marange and Clr Godfrey Mangoma -- who were fired by Government on corruption charges. The Government's decision to clear the councillors follows an investigation into the operations of the council by a committee headed by the Local Government, Rural and Urban Development director of human resources Ms Erica Jones. Local Government, Rural and Urban Development Minister Ignatius Chombo wrote to Kanyama informing him of the decision yesterday. Kanyama was also reported to the police for using fake documents to acquire three stands. ""Following an investigation team appointed by the minister . . . you were found guilty of abusing the office when you used non-existent companies and false bank statements in the process of acquiring stands,"" he said. Minister Chombo said Kanyama ceased to be a councillor in the interest of ""promoting good corporate governance and protection of public interests"". ""You shall forthwith cease to be a councillor. Your council should advise the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission of the vacancy,"" he said. However, Kanyama -- who was fired by the party together with others early this year -- said he was never given an opportunity to defend himself. ""I feel the minister should have offered me a chance to defend myself. I believe he was under pressure to fire me,"" he said. However, he could not name the people after his head. The report by Ms Jones was presented to Minister Chombo yesterday after a meeting attended by the municipality's senior managers and councillors. The investigation team delved into issues of land allocation, the three stands acquired by Kanyama and issues of corporate governance. Observers, however, said the decision by MDC-T to fire the Chitungwiza councillors on allegations of corruption were just a flimsy cover-up after the councillors defied a directive to elect senior party functionary Dr Vincent Gwaradzimba as mayor to replace Marange. However, the report makes scathing remarks on the management of land and human resources. Ms Jones said the administration of land in the municipality was ""shambolic"" and no systems were in place to verify the amount of land owned by the council. ""Our findings were that land management in Chitungwiza is an administrative shamble with no proper systems in place. The manual for management of urban State land was never used,"" she said. She said the municipality's finances were in bad shape, describing the situation as ""horrific"". Ms Jones said statutory remittances to such bodies as the National Social Security Authority, the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority and the Local Authorities Pension Fund dues were not paid. ""The so-called income-generating projects are loss-making ventures with ratepayers subsidising liquor outlets,"" she said. Ms Jones said the wage bill was chewing up to 70 percent of the council's revenue implying only a little went into service delivery. Meanwhile, some councillors have confirmed that the MDC-T has started moves to reinstate them with a view of following proper procedures in dismissing them. The party fired the councillors without hearing their side of the story, a move viewed as undemocratic. Recently, the MDC-T spokesperson Mr Nelson Chamisa refuted the reports. ""We are a party of excellence and our position to fire them stands,"" he said."41,The Informer (Monrovia),6/11/10,Cental Slams Govt War on Corruption - Takes Ellen to Task on Promise,,LIBERIA (95%),Newspaper,D Kaihenneh Sengbeh,ENGLISH,,,14-Jun-10,"MONROVIA, LIBERIA (73%)",1413  words,CORRUPTION (91%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (85%); HISTORY (78%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (78%); PUBLIC FINANCE (78%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (78%); WAR & CONFLICT (78%); AUDITS (78%); EXECUTIVES (77%); PRESS CONFERENCES (76%); POLITICS (75%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (75%); US PRESIDENTS (72%); BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (64%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (64%) Liberia; Crime and Corruption,"The Center for Transparency and Accountability in Liberia (Cental) has criticized the Liberian Government's professed war on corruption claiming that the menace of ""corruption remains rife and arguably on the increase"" in the country. The Executive Director of Cental (the local contact group of Transparency International) told a news conference yesterday (June 10) in Monrovia that the government has failed to clamp down hard on corrupt officials, who are living better lives, while majority of the people live in looming poverty. Mr. Thomas Doe Nah claimed that corruption has become pervasive in the country, enveloping the three branches of government, and is having a negative impact on the country's poverty reduction strategy: the government's blue print for the country's development and the thinning of acute poverty, which stands at nearly 70 percent. The government has repeatedly said it is ""making gains"" in the war on corruption, but has admitted that there are challenges. President Sirleaf has frequently admitted that corruption, which she declared 'Public Enemy Number One' during her inaugural address on January 16, 2006, remains a ""serious challenge"" to her administration, because the vice is 'endemic, systemic and culturally rooted'. This week she announced new measures to deal with corruption and corrupt officials in government. The Liberian leader, fresh from the U.S. where she received praises from President Obama, ordered cabinet ministers and top-level government officials to fire anyone engaged in acts of corruption under their noses. In the past she had asked government officials implicated in corruption to honorably resign without telling the public what actually happened, but warned on Monday that the days of such diplomacy in the war on corruption were over. More than 60 corruption cases are warehoused at the Ministry of Justice pending investigation since last year, the President has said, but nothing has been heard about those cases, opposition politicians and critics say. Finance Minister Augustine K. Ngafuan argues that the too many noise about corruption in government indicates that the ""fight is succeeding"", because ""people have the opportunity to see and talk about it"" -- a strange phenomenal in the country's history. But Cental said its interest is heightened by the apparent lack of political will by the President and other public officials in the three branches of government to take action that will halt the wastage of scarce state resources and checkmate blatant acts of corruption in the public sectors. ""CENTAL is convinced that despite the promulgation of laws, formation and rejuvenation of agencies to fight corruption, the menace corruption remains rife and arguably on the increase. This is the case because the government is refusing to operationalize laws and exhibit the political will require to address substantive issues raised in media reports and the findings of GAC [General Auditing Commission] audit reports, as well as deal sufficiently with corrupt officials at the national and local levels of government,"" Mr. Nah said in his seven-page press statement. There are so many Liberian living very diligently within the means and bounds of their salaries while other Liberians who purport to be sacrificing for their country are corrupt and intent on undermining systems and keeping the rest of the people in poverty, the Cental boss alleged. ""We cannot be serious about poverty reduction when corruption pervades all the projects that we brag about accomplishments to improve the livelihood of the people at the national and sub-national levels,"" Mr. Nah noted. He said words, rhetoric and meeting the conditionalities of multilateral institutions and foreign governments are insufficient to meet head on the ingrained tendency to commit corruption in Liberia. ""What is required is concrete and consistent action."" He said allowing corrupt and dismissible officials of government to resign honorably is also not responsive to fighting corruption, suggesting, ""What is needed and or expected include investigation, prosecution and punitive actions when officials are found culpable."" The local civic anti-corruption organization boss asserted that the fight against corruption in Liberia is more than just passing laws. ""It is more than dismissal or just asking people to resign. The fight is really about robust implementation of laws, so that corrupters are deterred by the action we take - people have to be investigated, prosecuted and if found guilty locked up and made to restitute public funds."" Mr. Nah highlighted and criticized the criticized the feeble role each of the three branches of government, the GAC, the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission, the Public Procurement and Concession Commission and the private sectors have played in the fifth against corruption. He claimed that Legislators as representatives of the people who should be the last ones to betray the trust of the people have already done so. He said the Legislature as the branch of government with direct oversight of the GAC has a responsibility to ensure that the GAC is supported, monitored and held to perform its role, but has failed. ""To date,"" he said, ""the legislature has failed to respond substantively to the numerous issues raised in audit reports released by the GAC. We are alarmed by the indifference shown by the National Legislature, which has oversight of the GAC to act on these reports."" Cental said ""the National Legislature's flagrant failure to opine on the GAC reports has allowed auditees to harangue spinelessly in a bid to discredit the GAC while they festoon in all the trappings of their corrupt acts."" On the Executive, Mr. Nan evoked President Sirleaf's January 16, 2006 robust statement to defeat corruption and noted that ""No President in our history has spoken so forcefully about the need to fight corruption and reduce the power of the presidency."" ""CENTAL,"" stressed Nah, ""believes that the President needs to do and translate those forcefully spoken words in to substantive deeds. She has caressed corruption and dwelled on symbolic posturing and rhetoric why failing to deal substantively with corruption."" He claimed that President Sirleaf ""has failed to wage the war against corruption regardless of where it exists, or by whom it is practiced."" ""Selective justice and the failure to act on the many substantive issues raised in audit reports undermine the fight against corruption and the poverty reduction strategic,"" the Cental chief said. Awarding a plus to GAC as a government institution in the fight of corruption, Cental admonished that Commission to that it and its staff are not above reproach and, like every other institution in post war Liberia, suffer from capacity constraints and are prone to errors in their work. He said despite its good work, GAC must be open to criticism because as much as it wants to interact with the public and ensure the passage of judgment on its reports, then findings and recommendations contained therein would be challenged. ""Therefore, it is only rational that the GAC responds professionally to counter opinions to its audit findings and refrain from wars in the press that undermine its professional disposition."" Central challenges the Anti Corruption Commission to be forceful and recommended reduction in the number of commission from five to three. The LACC is more than two years old and with the strong mandate enshrined in its Act of creation it has to be more proactive in arresting the surge of corruption in Liberia, Nah asserted. ""CENTAL believes that the upkeep of five commissioners is costly and an amendment of the LACC Act to reduce the commissioners to three and funds channeled to more investigation and prosecution as required,"" the organization suggested. He described the Ministry of Justice as playing a meaning less role in the fight against corruption and painted the judicial system as itself being a bastion of fraud. Cental Boss: ""The Ministry of Justice and the Judiciary have distressingly failed to support the fight against corruption. The Ministry of Justice has shown lack of spine in the prosecution of officials involved in corruption. It appears that the Ministry lacks independence, direction and operates on presidential orders."" He alleged that bribery in the courts is pervasive and lawyers without integrity and professional restrain bid for justice by compromising jurors, sheriffs and other courts officials."42,The New Times (Kigali),6/16/10,"Fight Against Corruption to Bring in Private Sector, NGOs",,RWANDA (75%),Newspaper,Stevenson Mugisha,ENGLISH,,,16-Jun-10,,159  words,CORRUPTION (92%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (91%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (90%); INTERVIEWS (88%) Rwanda; NGOs and Civil Society; Crime and Corruption,"The Office of the Ombudsman has revealed that a new policy is being drawn to incorporate all Non Governmental Organisations and the private sector in the campaign against corruption.

""The Executive of our Government does not even as much as pay lip service to fighting corruption any longer. Full-blooded cronyism has won the day instead. If it were otherwise, why on earth has Peter Tshirumbu-Tsheehama, former Cabinet Minister and former Member of Parliament, been allowed full use of two Government vehicles, a sedan and an off-road 4x4, two full years and more after his resignation from Parliament and the Cabinet?"" Ulenga asked when motivating this motion. ""The concerned politician resigned from both Parliament and Cabinet on April 8 2008 due to health reasons, and was replaced by another from his political party. ""However, up until November 2009 Mr Tsheehama was still in possession of three Government vehicles, the executive Volvo S60, accorded him as part of his remuneration and use as Minister, a Volkswagen Citigolf, and an off-road Toyota Hilux,"" Ulenga alleged. ""In November 2009, one year and six months after the termination of his parliamentary and Cabinet membership, Mr Tsheehama bought the Volvo S60, but retained the full, free use of the two other vehicles 'until further notice'. ""It is appreciated that the Honourable Tsheehama has been unwell for some time. Government could however have provided for its Members through proper and lawful coverage without sliding into dubious practices,"" the CoD president criticised. Presidential Affairs Minister Albert Kawana and Agriculture Minister John Mutorwa reminded Ulenga that people's names may not be mentioned in the House unless the things said about them could be substantiated. Safety and Security Minister Nangolo Mbumba, who now heads the Ministry formerly run by Tshirumbu-Tsheehama, said the use of the vehicle was surely authorised.

Global Witness is calling upon the Government of Liberia to promote better financial governance by implementing the recommendations of audits carried out as part of the HIPC process. Five key ministries were audited by the Liberian Government's General Auditing Commission as a requirement under HIPC, including the Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy. Reforms in the latter are particularly important to ensure accountability and transparency in the mining sector. ""Being granted debt relief is an important step on Liberia 's road to economic recovery. The next will be to ensure that revenue from Liberia 's natural resources is not lost to corruption and mismanagement but instead helps to fund the country's reconstruction,"" said Natalie Ashworth , campaigner for Global Witness. An audit of the Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy reported financial irregularities amounting to over US$2.8 million. It also identified major weaknesses in the internal controls within Liberia 's diamond sector. These threaten the Government's ability to implement the Kimberley Process the international certification scheme to prevent the trade and export of conflict diamonds. The audit recommends that the mining ministry provides receipts for its unexplained expenditures and ensures that the Kimberley Process guidelines are followed. HIPC aims to ensure that no poor country faces a debt burden it cannot manage. The debt relief should free up resources to fund Liberia 's reconstruction effort following years of resource-fuelled conflict. ""The Liberian government will only be able to make the most of this debt relief and harness the revenue from the country's natural resources if it is gets serious about stamping out corruption, institutes the necessary financial controls and implements the findings of the audit of the mines ministry,"" said Ashworth. The Kimberley Process is a rough diamond certification scheme, established in 2003. It brings together governments, industry and civil society, and aims to eradicate the trade in conflict diamonds. Member states are required to pass national legislation and set up an import/export control system. HIPC provides assistance to eligible countries that commit to poverty reduction through policy changes that institute sound economic governance. Global Witness investigates and campaigns to prevent natural resource-related conflict and corruption and associated environmental and human rights abuses."48,The Namibian (Windhoek),7/2/10,Corruption a Cancerous Growth - Ulenga,,NAMIBIA (94%),Newspaper,Brigitte Weidlich,ENGLISH,,,5-Jul-10,,532  words,CORRUPTION (95%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); POLITICS (89%); CANCER (89%); ETHICS (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (78%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (73%); INVESTIGATIONS (66%); FREEDOM OF INFORMATION (64%); CONTRACT AWARDS (60%); WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION (50%) Namibia; Crime and Corruption,"THE ""cancerous disease"" of corruption continued growing and spreading throughout Namibian society despite measures and laws to fight it, opposition leader Ben Ulenga said in the National Assembly on Tuesday. Ulenga of the Congress of Democrats (CoD), who tabled a motion calling for a debate on how to reduce corruption, said President Hifikepunye Pohamba in his inaugural address in March 2005 ""declared zero tolerance of corruption and pledged to fight corruption with a sledgehammer"", but not much had come of it. ""Soon after his speech everyone jumped on the anti-corruption bandwagon and even songs, ditties and lullabies were composed on the anti-corruption theme. In 2006 the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) came into existence, adding to the high expectations the nation had about dealing with the malady,"" Ulenga said. However, the enthusiasm faded and some people said the Head of State had been too quick to ""declare war on a devious foe, against whom he had no dedicated army"". Despite the loud anti-corruption noises there was no national strategy against corruption, according to Ulenga. ""It became apparent that political leadership in the fight against corruption had been limited to the President's speeches and there was no sufficient political will among the rest of elected political representatives at executive and legislative levels."" There had been no enthusiasm among the majority of politicians to adhere to clear-cut codes of conduct, and not much willingness to declare assets publicly, Ulenga charged. ""As far as the duties of politicians and especially members of this House are concerned, a holistic legal and legislative approach has been lacking. To date there is no strong, rigorous, comprehensive and complementary legal and legislative reform to fight corruption,"" he criticised. He said Namibia had no law dealing with the forfeiture of proceeds from corrupt transactions. ""Our law does not provide comprehensive protection of whistleblowers, we have no legal mechanism to investigate people with unexplained wealth, individuals who are wealthy beyond their known sources of income. Our regulations concerning the declaration of assets by public individuals are very patchy and ad hoc."" 'Tenderpreneurship', being the practice of self-enrichment through obtaining Government tenders via personal, family or political connections in Government, had emerged as possibly the most malignant form of the cancer of corruption, Ulenga added. A rigorous transparency regime was needed including freedom of information laws to publish all short-listed companies and those awarded Government tenders, plus the names of all individuals behind such companies, he proposed. This would assist the anti-corruption authorities as well as the public to access information and act on corrupt practices. It was also time for a law to regulate political funding of parties by business, Ulenga said. He also wants the Office of the President to receive reports on the ""so-called political loans given in recent years to businesses,"" especially in northern Namibia. Another proposal by Ulenga was a law on the forfeiture of the proceeds of corrupt activities. The debate on the motion continues."49,New Democrat (Monrovia),7/11/10,World Bank Official Wants Corruption Tackled,,LIBERIA (94%); UNITED STATES (79%); AFRICA (79%),Newspaper,Festus Poquie,ENGLISH,,,12-Jul-10,"MONROVIA, LIBERIA (74%)",213  words,INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (92%); BANKING & FINANCE (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); DEVELOPMENT BANKS (90%); PUBLIC DEBT (78%); EXTERNAL DEBT (78%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (70%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (69%); EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (66%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (65%) Liberia; International Organizations and Africa; Crime and Corruption,"Liberia's US$4.9 million debt owed various financial institutions, now waived, affected its integrity relative to borrowing,World Bank country Manager Ohene Owusu Nyanin said Wednesday.

The issue of corruption has been talked about on countless occasions and in different forums and the general agreement is that it is a fatal cancer, which has to be eradicated once and for all. On its part, Government has gone to the extent of creating an Anti-Corruption Commission to address it. In his maiden address to the August house, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai promised to open more avenues of accountability by creating a website for interaction with the general public. The Treasury boss, Mr Biti also unequivocally stated in his three-year macro-economic policy and budget framework (2010-2012) that measures to enhance integrity and accountability will be central to the successful implementation of economic reforms during the framework period. What remains in the hearts and minds of the ordinary Zimbabweans is whether Government has enough stamina to tackle and expunge this social ill. We believe corruption tends to diminish the effectiveness of an economic policy by at least 10 percent from what could have been achieved if it was non-existent. Different Fiscal and Monetary policies can be introduced to spur economic growth but corruption reverses these good intentions as stated in those documents. I came face to face with corruption tendencies just few days ago as I was hastening to replace my national identity card to be able to attend the budget presentation. I was asked to fork out US$30 to secure the ID timeously, I defied the culture at the institution until I secured the document without paying anything because that is supposed to be how it was done. I believe that can be a first step in arresting corruption. I also questioned whether those people appreciated the economic meaning of US$30, because it is a significant sum of money. In this article, I will try analysing how the important pillars for economic growth and development are compromised by corruption hence failing to drive the economy in a desired direction. These pillars include but are not limited to education, economic empowerment, political positions, human resource development and even in talent identification and development. Statistically, Nigeria is considered the most corrupt nation in Africa and the costs of this vice to the West African state are there for all to see. Besides contributing about 3 percent to total world oil output there are constant queues for fuel, most of the refinery plants are outside their country so they have to import the special liquid, in addition they still have the worst traffic jam in Lagos than anywhere else in the world. The reason for this is corruption and not a population explosion. Let me begin with education, most of the schools and tertiary institutions in Zimbabwe have been involved in asking for kickbacks during enrolment even when the prospective does not possess the right qualifications. The economic cost of this is that the students that would be churned out would be half-baked graduates in almost all disciplines be it Commerce, Medicine, Law, Engineering and so on. It is a case of garbage in, garbage out. This has its multiplier effect in the professional world where productivity seems to have been significantly curtailed. Our research shows that only between 15 and 20 percent of managers in the country are qualified for their positions with the rest being actors and actresses. In terms of directors, 8-2 percent deserve to be sitting in different boards across the economic sphere. This state of affairs will not improve soon since our indigenisation policies will continue promoting the status quo. The solution lies in recruiting the right students at college not the right employee. Economic empowerment though a noble policy is also being compromised. Authorities should guard against backroom transacting of share ownership schemes. It would not be pleasant to experience the status where the haves will continue having by virtue of their deeper pockets and connections. If this vice continues, they won't be any fruits of empowerment since it will be a case of replacing the white skin with the black pigment, ours is not a Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) project, it's the empowerment of local Zimbabweans I suppose. This will naturally narrow the tax base, which has a risk of even eroding it in case of tax avoidance and evasion by the few privileged ones. According to the World Bank report on Africa, Zimbabwe is lowly ranked in terms of "" Ease of Doing Business"" index. Irregardless of this foreigners are flocking into the country. This is because of corrupt tendencies by some of the involved parties. In the end no foreign currency is earned, the expatriates who come will transfer their wealth back to their home country at the expense of this nation. The costs for starting a company in Zimbabwe are relatively high and they are worsened by kickbacks to be honoured if one is to shun bureaucracy. A lot of ""tender-preneurs"" seem to be arising in our midst, remember these are not entrepreneurs. They wait to pounce on any tenders coming out without adding value to the Gross Domestic Product. Government must be wary of such personalities since some of them can sound so vocal in defence of transparency and honesty when they are actually the culprits. The film and music industries are among some of the most celebrated industries in the World, how much is United States of America government amassing out of the fame and fortune of Hollywood. Is that revenue not enough to support smaller states such as Vermont and Rhode Island? In Zimbabwe, those responsible for talent identification and development are not forthcoming and some of the radio presenters seem to be inclined to specific musicians. If ever they are receiving bribes, the obvious effect is killing the spirit of Zimbabwean music in general and that special musician in particular. The music industry is a journey and getting airplay is a privilege not a right, it is also a function of the product quality. If people continue being bombarded with similar lackluster music, they will resort to pirated DVDs from abroad hence continuously impoverishing the music stakeholders and the Government through failure to levy tax on such musicians. Those who are corrupt tend to have infectious tendencies of spreading corruption tentacles, in shona they call that ""kutonyora"". The perpetrators of this include our police force, the legal stakeholders and even the complainants. We want a scenario where after the treasury boss fails to raise the salaries of the civil servants, no Zimbabwe residents should carry the cost by using bribes to receive the service. It has to be noted that even in the private sector, corruption is rife. The vice of corruption is not only limited to African states, it is the effect which it poses to African states which is more disastrous considering that you will be ""extracting"" from the almost empty granary. One of Barack Obama's campaign messages in the run-up to his election was to eradicate corruption and bureaucracy especially in Washington, Hillary Clinton was linked to the Whitewater scandal during her stint as a first lady of the USA. Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian premier was implicated in countless cases which involve financial impropriety and Jacob Zuma of South Africa came into office on his way from the courts to answer charges on arms deal scandal together with Shaib Shaik. In Togo, using the name Faure is a ticket to promotion in the civil sector. Faure is the surname of the presidential family in Togo. We cannot condone corruption as a nation simply because we are living below the poverty datum line. What corruption does is to make us worse off at the same time suffocating economic development since we will continue taxing the helpless members of society who are struggling to make ends meet. I rest my case. God bless you.

Regionalism and nepotism, the former military ruler observed, weaken the strong institutions which his party, the SLPP, built over ten years. ""Nepotism is a denial of social justice and fairness. For a post conflict nation like ours, this does not augur well for good governance and our young democracy,"" he said. ""The IMF recently announced that this APC government has failed to create the fiscal space to finance investment in basic infrastructure and implement structural reforms to promote higher sustainable private sector-led economic growth. The badly thought out and implemented GST is not making the situation any better. Poor handling of the economy plus hardship for ordinary Sierra Leoneans equal incompetent leadership,"" noted and then campaigned: ""Choose Julius Maada Bio for SLPP presidential flag bearer, vote for a new direction - a new direction to economic reform and national development, governance and institutional reform; transparency and accountability, peace building and national reconciliation, social justice and fairness."" Reacting to Bio's charge, minister of information and communication, Alhaji Ibrahim Ben Kargbo, who also doubles as government spokesman, said his ministry does not want to politicize national issues but noted that the Bio propaganda website issue will be dealt with accordingly. Mr. Kargbo said his government has done much during the three years of their reign in areas like agriculture, health, education and energy - all within a very short time. ""What has the SLPP done during their 11 years added to the NPRC 5 years; it accumulated to 15 years in governance? It was during our reign that donor funding resurrected and on corruption, the president is firmed on his decisions regarding his relatives or closed allies. Ministers are arrested and put on trial for corruption; government doesn't interfere with the work of the ACC,"" the information minister said. Kargbo said Bio does not know civil issues as he once ruled a military government.

He said it was news to them to hear that the Tonkolili district council did not receive the local tax money for 2007, 2008 and 2009 in respect of Konike chiefdom. Deputy chief administrator of the Tonkolili district council, Michael M.

However, deputy minister of internal affairs and local government, Raymond Kabia told Concord Times that they had not received any official complaint from the council with regards the alleged embezzlement of local tax money by the Paramount Chief. ""No complaint was made to us officially by the council. We only listen to complaints in written and not verbally,"" he said. But according to Kabia, it was discovered in 2009 by his ministry that the Konike Paramount Chief has not been sending tax money to the district council. ""We instructed Hon. PC Kanagbaro Sanka to pay to the district council the money collected as local tax in his chiefdom. After that, we were informed that the chief had deposited some amount of money to the chiefdom bank account,"" he explained.

""On government's commitment to fight corruption, Rwanda proves to be the most committed with 97.1%, followed by Uganda with 30.5%, Tanzania with 29.4%, Burundi with 22.2% and the least committed being Kenya with 22.1%,"" a statement from Transparency Rwanda quotes the EABI. Rwanda also tops the report's projected level of corruption decrease in the next one year, after scoring 90.3%, followed by Burundi with 23.5%, Kenya with 22.9%, Tanzania with 21.1% whereas Uganda is with 18.9% projection. The EABI states a number of reasons Rwanda has succeeded in fighting corruption among which, is the establishment of the Office of the Ombudsman in 2004 to monitor transparency and compliance to laws in all government sectors. ""The Ombudsman's office regularly exposes cases of fraud, malpractice and corruption at the top, middle and bottom levels of the public sector. This is evident through the stern action taken against a number of senior government officials implicated in corruption,"" the report reads. The EABI survey was carried out in EAC member countries as a fulfilment of the region's goal aimed at capturing corruption experienced by ordinary citizens when interacting with officials of public and private organizations. It was initiated by Transparency International Kenya in 2002 and later implemented in Uganda and Tanzania in 2008, and was concluded in Rwanda and Burundi in February this year."57,The New Times (Kigali),7/24/10,EAC Needs a Common Strategy Against Corruption [opinion],,"EASTERN AFRICA (95%); RWANDA (94%); AFRICA (94%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (92%); BURUNDI (79%); UGANDA (79%); KENYA (79%) East Africa",Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,26-Jul-10,,281  words,CORRUPTION (97%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); BRIBERY (90%); RANKINGS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); ETHICS (77%); BUSINESS ETHICS (68%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (68%) Rwanda; Crime and Corruption; International Organizations and Africa,"In a survey that measured bribery levels in the private and public sectors in East Africa, that was released on Thursday, Transparency International, ranked Rwanda, the least corrupt country in the region. The anti-corruption watchdog's East African Bribery Index (EABI) sates that Rwanda's corruption prevalence is at 6.6 percent and that government's commitment to fight corruption is rated at 97.1 percent. Tanzania came second in the rankings with a prevalence of 28.6 percent, followed by Kenya 31.9 percent, Uganda 33 percent and Burundi 36.7 percent. These findings and various political and socio-economic achievements registered by Rwanda practically indicate that this nation is run in the most transparent manner. Corruption is a dangerous vice which undermines governance, sustainable development, democratic process, and fair business practices. And indeed, Transparency International warned that the level of corruption in East Africa threatens to hold back the recently launched common market's full potential. Therefore, the fight against corruption should be a regional battle and should start from the grass root. Other EAC countries can also learn from Rwanda and create strong Ombudsman offices capable of regularly exposing cases of fraud, malpractice and corruption at the top, middle and bottom levels of the public sector. Moreover, private companies in collaboration with relevant authorities must put in place strict internal controls and establish ethics and compliance programs, as part of a strategy to combat corruption in their businesses. Otherwise, corruption will undermine the fruits of the EAC integration through holding back economic development in all sectors."58,The New Times (Kigali),7/27/10,Kabandana Gets Five Years for Corruption,,RWANDA (93%),Newspaper,Edmund Kagire,ENGLISH,,,28-Jul-10,,366  words,EMBEZZLEMENT (92%); SENTENCING (91%); JAIL SENTENCING (90%); FINES & PENALTIES (90%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); CONTRACT AWARDS (90%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (89%); APPEALS COURTS (89%); VERDICTS (89%); LITIGATION (78%); GUILTY PLEAS (78%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (78%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (77%); ARRESTS (74%); BRIBERY (74%); ADMISSIONS & CONFESSIONS (72%); INTERNAL AUDITS (66%); AUDITS (61%) Rwanda; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"The intermediate court of Nyarugenge, yesterday sentenced Marc Kabandana, the former Director General of Rwanda Institute of Administration and Management (RIAM) to five and a half years in prison for embezzling public funds and flouting tendering procedures.

Delivering this year's key note address on the theme, ""In National Unity we will stand"" at the Independent celebration in Sanniquellie, Nimba County, Father Tikpor emphasized that for Liberia to progress, corruption must be buried. The Catholic Monsignor also revealed that in the 70's, Liberia's economy was comparable to Japan stressing; ""Liberia's capital income was second to that of Japan. Then, Japan was the richest country in the world while Liberia came second. Even the Great USA would be placed underneath Liberia."" ""All these were due to our natural resources more especially the rubber. But because of corruption and other ills, Liberia's economy cannot be compared to Japan.""

The 84 year old catholic prelate said corruption in both private and public sectors, selfishness, greed and lack of patriotism are the root causes of poverty the country is experiencing. Father Tikpor observed that people are continuing to put personal interest over national interest, adding, this led to serious division during the war years. Speaking on the theme: ""In National Unity We Will Stand"", Father Tikpor, urged all Liberians to work together to surgically cut-off what he calls cancerous tissues from our records. He believes this can be achieved if we put the welfare of our country over our personal cravings and wants. The orator also calls for the identification of a national language, and revision of the country's motto to enhance unity. He observed ""the love of liberty brought us here"" promotes sectionalism as there were people here when the settlers arrived. It can be recalled, the 2008 Independence Day orator also called for action on the language and motto but no concrete step has been taken to address them.

Jerome Vedier says injustice, impunity, corruption, human rights violations, nepotism, cronism, lack of participation and the exclusionary governance policies of the past were the major root causes of the Liberian conflicts being identified by the TRC The TRC Commissioner made the statement recently during the closing of the trc headquarters and major activities of the TRC relating to its mandate as a corporate institution of government. Cllr. Verdier said the nightmare is not over if these conflictual or conflict induced issues are not addressed by a society which to date bears the fresh scars, hate, division and disunity founded in the history of the country and the policies of all governments past and, unfortunately, present. ""We have no illusion of the difficulty and intricate nature of issues associated with the implementation of the TRC's recommendations which without doubt cannot be implemented over night. Like reconciliation, it will take years before full implementation is achieved, but we need to commit ourselves to the implementation and begin in earnest a process or framework for implementation. We are exceedingly gratified that the United Nations peace building fund have allocated funds to support implementation of TRC recommendations ""that enhance reconciliation,"" Cllr. Verdier asserted. He said this is a valuable contribution to building a new society in Liberia as we hasten to point out that it is not only the ""palava hut"" process recommendations that enhance reconciliation but that the entire TRC process and all its recommendations, when considered, enhance, contribute to and promote peace and reconciliation in Liberia. The former Catholic Justice and Peace Commission (JPC) Boss said reconciliation is a process and not a commodity purchased in the absence or without the building of a just and equitable society founded on the rule of law with abiding conviction that all is equal in rights, privileges and entitlements to justice, security and self actualization, adding, we agree with those who say that peace is not just the absence of war, but the presence of justice. The former TRC Chairman further indicated that without justice or a credible threat of prosecution impunity will flourish in our society. The rich and powerful will trample on the rights of the weak and poor without remorse or redress. Authority will be abused, innocent citizens and police officers will be continuously flocked for doing what is right and nothing will come out of it: there will be no justice, he said. ""Liberia have bred, nurtured and built a perverse and oppressive society in which the status quo is never wrong and the ultimate end of our struggle is bread and butter. This is wrong, immoral and it has to change; otherwise our society will never progress and we will be nothing but a society of thieves and beggars. where the thieves suppress, cheat and deprive the beggars and the beggars on the other hand continuously glorify, follow, defend, protect and praise the thieves because they want to continue begging for bread and butter from the crumps of the thief's table; and with little ambition, no dreams and abounding complacency they (the beggars) relish the status of associating with thieves, because they aspire to becoming thieves themselves someday soon,"" he said. ""The state structure in Liberia is pervasive and predatory; its structures are abusive; its authorities are top headed and its subjects are ignorant, helpless and gullible victims of over a century old culture of patronage and sycophancy. So pervasive is this culture that we have become impervious to truth and justice. This too, should not be the new Liberia; this too, has got to change. ""Our President, Her Excellency, has an enormous responsibility on hand and must lead with abiding faith in god and commitment to justice and the rule of law to change Liberia completely from the deeds of the past that have left Liberia walloping at the bottom of the human development index; disconnected by centuries of unpaved roads and no roads at all; with very little access to quality health and education; without a patriotic citizenry and a nation every one flees from and never proud to call a home beyond mere citizenship. Wihtout adorning the cult of the historical imperial presidency, the president will have to be ""strong"" for peace, reconciliation, unity, justice and the rule of law,"" He asserted. ""To date, Her Excellency the President is lagging behind in her statutory commitment to report quarterly on the implementation of the TRC recommendations and not a voice including that of the National Legislature have been heard. The entire country is mute on the nonperformance of the president on a major duty that should have happened more than a month ago. While not much was recognized in the president's first quarterly ""report"" in march 2010, it was noteworthy for recognizing the good work of the commission and the far reaching implications of the recommendations on the future of Liberia. This obligation to report to the Liberian people quarterly on the implementation of all recommendations of the trc is imperative and vital to our continued drive for lasting peace and reconciliation. We urge Her Excellency, the president not to renege but be strong in faith and do what is right so that this glorious land of liberty will continue to exist under god's command, He urged."65,The Namibian (Windhoek),8/13/10,Goabab Cleared of Corruption Charges,,NAMIBIA (94%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%),Newspaper,Werner Menges,ENGLISH,,,13-Aug-10,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (88%)",782  words,CORRUPTION (95%); SUPREME COURTS (90%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); APPEALS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); ACQUITTAL (77%); JUDGES (77%); ARRESTS (73%); WAGES & SALARIES (61%); BUDGETS (61%) Namibia; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"FORMER National Assembly Secretary Nama Goabab and National Assembly accountant Abraham George are off the hook - for now at least - on the main charges of corruption on which they have been on trial in the High Court in Windhoek. Judge Marlene Tommasi discharged Goabab on all three main counts of corruption he had been facing, while George was discharged on two main counts of corruption, in a ruling given in the High Court yesterday. She however refused an application to also find them not guilty on the alternative charges they are facing. This refusal to discharge them on all counts leaves Goabab and George facing an alternative charge of fraud under the first count, alternative charges of fraud or theft under the second count, and in respect of Goabab alone an alternative charge of use of a motor vehicle without the owner's consent under the third charge. Following the ruling Deputy Prosecutor General Orben Sibeya told Judge Tommasi that the prosecution's next step would be to ask to be allowed to appeal to the Supreme Court against the ruling. If the State is given leave to appeal at this stage of the trial already, it could result in a long postponement of the trial while a decision from the country's highest court is awaited. Judge Tommasi's ruling hinged on her reading of the Anti-Corruption Act's definition of a corrupt act, and the question whether this definition would cover the acts Goabab and George are charged with. She concluded that the Anti-Corruption Act does not clearly criminalise the acts they are accused of. The main charges against Goabab (53) and George (49) were counts of corruptly using an office or position for gratification. Two of the charges related to the renting of vehicles for Goabab's use at Government cost between March 1 and April 24 2007. In the end no public funds were used to pay for the first rental. The second rental was paid for out of the NationalAssembly's budget, but Goabab repaid this money - an amount of N$18 487,20 - to Government within days after his arrest on the charges in June 2007. According to Goabab it had all along been the arrangement that he would finally be responsible for the costs of the vehicle rentals. The third charge, faced by Goabab alone, stemmed from his use of a Government vehicle on May 25 2007, while he was receiving a vehicle allowance as part of his salary as National Assembly Secretary. In her ruling, Judge Tommasi referred to the definition of corruption in previous laws on the issue that had applied in Namibia - being the 1928 Prevention of Corruption Ordinance and the 1985 Prevention of Corruption Amendment Act - as well as in South Africa's Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act of 2004. In all of these laws, the definition of corruption included the presence of someone who corrupts someone else, and a person who is being corrupted, she indicated. From these definitions, she concluded: ""The offending act is receiving a benefit (from any other person)."" The Anti-Corruption Act of 2003 does not contain a similar definition clearly stipulating that the source of gratification should be from another person, she said. From the historical perspective of the laws on corruption in Namibia, it is clear though that the actions of both the person being corrupted and the person corrupting someone else were criminalised, the judge said. She indicated that she also took into account the principle of legality, which is that an accused person may not be convicted of a contravention of a law unless the law clearly criminalises the conduct. Given the history of the offence of corruption in Namibia and the principle of legality, Judge Tommasi said, she came to the conclusion that the meaning of section 43(1) of the Anti-Corruption Act, under which Goabab and George were charged, should be interpreted strictly. This provision only relates to someone being corrupted, she found. ""It follows then that the State needed to prove that gratification was obtained from another person, that is, that the public officer allowed himself to be corrupted,"" she reasoned. The evidence placed before the court however did not include anyone playing the role of a corruptor, she said. ""The legislature could not have intended for the courts to usurp the State's function to discipline its staff unless it falls within the framework of the criminal law,"" she remarked. In these circumstances it has become ""abundantly clear"" that the State has not produced evidence to support a conviction on any of the main counts, she said. The case is now scheduled to return to court on Wednesday next week. Goabab is being represented by Lucius Murorua, while Christie Mostert is appearing for George."66,The Namibian (Windhoek),8/23/10,Boois Corruption Case Goes to Regional Court,,NAMIBIA (94%),Newspaper,Luqman Cloete,ENGLISH,,,23-Aug-10,,202  words,CORRUPTION (92%); HOUSING AUTHORITIES (90%); MAGISTRATES (90%); SCANDALS (78%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (73%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (73%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (73%); PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (68%) Namibia; Crime and Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE corruption case against Karas Governor Dawid Boois will be heard in the Keetmanshoop Regional Court on November 29.

Amaible Havugiyaremye, a Principle State Attorney in the Ministry of Justice underscored the need to sensitize people on the ills of corruption, adding that it's a vice when not dealt with early enough can negatively affect the larger population in society. Officials also said that there is need to expedite conclusion of the protocol on good governance with emphasis on entrenching provisions that promote popular participation and people centeredness in good governance issues. The EAC Deputy Secretary General (Political Federation), Beatrice Kiraso, had earlier said that the draft protocol on good governance was yet to reach the partner states for consultation, and that the process had begun with broader stakeholders like Chiefs of Justice and National Parliamentarians. On the role of media in promotion of good governance, delegates recommended the need to develop and implement regional mechanisms that guide development of a media that is responsible, responsive, professional and accountable. Fred Mufulukye, the Director General of Territorial Administration and Governance in the Ministry of Local Government, said that the media requires quality control to ensure that its role does not jeopardize national sovereignty, national development and social cohesion.

Corruption was at a record high in 2007 where it increased by 138 percent from 145 cases the previous year to 345 cases, according to the report. Police Spokesperson, Supt. Eric Kayiranga said that the reduction was mainly due to the establishment of a section within the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) specifically charged with investigating corruption-related crimes. ""Rwanda has made significant strides in fighting corruption and the Police force is committed to continue with this fight until it is significantly reduced,"" Kayiranga said in an interview yesterday. He added that thorough investigations into corruption have been made and a number of suspects arrested. Kayiranga added that the community had been sensitized in the fight against corruption through community policing and working hand-in-hand with law enforcement institutions and other stakeholders. ""All these have contributed to a significant reduction of corruption and related crimes which made Rwanda the least corrupt country in the region in recent rankings,"" he said.

""This goes with self discipline that characterizes most of our Police officers,"" Kayiranga noted He, however, noted that there are officers who succumb to corruption despite existing mechanisms, but he said that most of them have been caught and sacked. ""Those elements that were found corrupt were expelled from the police. Such officers go against the promotion of the core values and tarnish the image of the institution, which we cannot tolerate,"" Kayiranga said.

He called upon the employees to always evaluate themselves to ascertain how far they have gone in implementing the contracts, instead of waiting for the general evaluation all districts.

Several attempts to communicate with the town's CEO amicably about the matter has proven fruitless as he has received no answers. In fact, it was eventually communicated to Kruger that he was no longer an employee of the municipality and therefore there was no need to process any work-related issues with him. ""I am now on pension. I have done my work faithfully and served the Swakopmund municipality diligently. Everything I did was to the advantage of the council and of the rate payers. I did my job 100 per cent. They made accusations against my person and my profession. Until now I have been waiting for answers from them which they are seemingly trying to avoid,"" Kruger told The Namibian. In 2008 Kruger and his colleague Herman Engelbrecht, also a long-serving senior traffic officer, but who is no longer employed at the municipality, were suspended for 45 days. This was for allegedly abusing their powers as traffic managers in an incident concerning a member of public that was fined for an alleged traffic offence. After a complaint from the person and a legal inquiry by Kruger into the merits of the complaint, Kruger made the decision to withdraw the charge against this member of public. ""The reason I did this was because what we did was legally wrong and therefore I wanted to protect the municipality from unnecessary claims and possible embarrassment,"" he said. This decision led to rumours and accusations that reached the CEO and the Council Management Committee's ears and, heeding to these rumours, allegedly without approaching Kruger for his side of the story, a suspension followed - while Kruger was on leave. ""Why did the Chairman of the Management Committee and the CEO not approach me first, as municipal policy stipulate, to hear my side. This could have been settled very simply if we had talked. But instead they jumped the gun, suspended me, and we were dragged to court,"" he said. ""They allowed a totally lob-sided grievance committee to submit a report to council without approaching us before charging us on several charges pertaining to municipal employment irregularities."" The two men were found innocent in court and the suspension was lifted. Shortly after their return to office a forensic investigation was launched into the traffic department for alleged irregularities. During this investigation Kruger submitted his grievances of a staff member who had allegedly ""insulted"" him through a letter which, according to him, was never dealt with. The staff member later also allegedly insulted council for 'poor work and management' and then only, according to Kruger, was the person disciplined and warned. ""Why did they not act against this person when I submitted the grievance?"" he asked. During this time Kruger was also busy investigating a matter of the alleged illegal issuance of a driver's licence, where the rules and regulations were not followed. It was during this internal investigation of his that the municipality's Corporate Services and Human Resources departments interfered and stalled the investigation. Forensics, however, later found that the licence was indeed issued illegally. His question was why no disciplinary action was taken against the people. ""I know from very reliable sources that this forensic investigation was completed while I was still employed (June last year) and that the finding blew up in council's face because there was nothing against me,"" he said. ""My questions are, why until today, council has not given any feedback whatsoever on the findings internally, or to the ratepayers who paid N$384 000 for the investigation? Why is this being held under covers? The only answer that I received,in June this year, is that the matter is personal in nature, and that I am no longer an employee and therefore it has nothing to do with me."" For Kruger, this is not a matter of vengeance. It is rather a matter of accountability and transparency and just to have closure on the matter which is seemingly being withheld, he said. ""Besides, they are very right that I am no longer an employee, but I am a ratepayer of Swakopmund and I have the right to get answers to these questions."" The Namibian attempted to get comment from Swakopmund CEO, Eckard Demasius, but he will only be back in office on September 20."73,The New Times (Kigali),9/18/10,Judiciary Urged to Fight Corruption,,RWANDA (93%),Newspaper,Ivan R.

Speaking during a one-day conference for over 100 judges and court clerks serving in Gasabo, Nyarugenge and Gicumbi districts, Busingye said that the judiciary must work hard to maintain their independence and act impartiality. ""Rwanda has set a record as a country with zero tolerance to corruption; the whole world is now watching us to see if we can uphold our laws or give way to corruption. It's therefore your obligation as judges and court clerks to take on your responsibility of protecting the image of our profession,"" Busingye said. He later revealed in an interview that corruption and bribery in the courts had dropped tremendously in the last ten years, to almost negligible levels. ""Last year, only three court clerks were dismissed from work because of corruption-related cases. However, this year there has not been a single case so far. This implies that we are on the right track,"" he said. On the issue of a heavy backlog of cases pending in the courts, Busingye said that there are strong government measures, backed by stakeholders' support, aimed at improving the situation. ""Every judge is required to deliver a minimum of 15 judgments every month; on top of this requirement, we need to work out creative ways of resolving conflict at the domestic level; this way, all cases shall be concluded fast,"" he said."74,Concord Times (Freetown),9/21/10,'Corruption Can Be Dealt With...' ...Deputy ACC Boss,,SIERRA LEONE (79%),Newspaper,Ibrahim Tarawallie,ENGLISH,,,21-Sep-10,"FREETOWN, SIERRA LEONE (90%)",414  words,CORRUPTION (92%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%); CITY GOVERNMENT (77%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (74%); RURAL COMMUNITIES (56%) Sierra Leone; Crime and Corruption,"Deputy head of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has voiced his belief that corruption can only be dealt with when it is looked at systematically. Speaking at the opening of a two-day training on policy formulation and implementation organized by his commission for councilors of the Freetown City and the Western Rural District councils, Morlai Buya Kamara said: ""We will only deal with corruption when we look at it systematically to know its root cause."" He said the picture being seen today was a very scaring one, thus giving them a very daunting task in the fight against graft in the country. ""We need to be serious about reforming our system to be able to fight corruption. It behoves all of us to know what we are doing because most of the problems we encounter as a nation have to do with our system,"" he observed. The anti-graft commission deputy boss urged participants to make the training more meaningful by putting into practice what they had learnt. ""Policy formulation and implementation should be given prominence in your various local councils,"" Kamara urged. Deputy Mayor of Freetown, Gibril Kanu, thanked the ACC for bringing them onboard to identify the problems in policy formulation and implementation. He assured the commission that they would put into practice the knowledge gained during the course of the training, noting that the training was important and timely. Capacity building manager at the Decentralization Secretariat, Jonathan Kpakiwa, said if governance was to improve and people were to realize their dreams, ""it is but fitting to collaborate with the ACC"". He said the training would be very much useful for local councils because they were there to implement the policies formulated by government. Kpakiwa encouraged participants to make good use of the training, while imploring the ACC to replicate the exercise to all the 19 local councils across the country. Director of local government in the ministry of Internal Affairs, Aiah Joseph Lebbie, said policy formulation ensured effective performance and served as a guide on what should be done. ""The training will broaden participants' understanding of policy formulation and implementation. We should be good at making and implementing policies; making sound policies without implementing them is a waste of time,"" Lebbie maintained. He commended the ACC for embarking on measures to prevent corruption, while urging them to also look at ministries, departments and agencies on policy formulation."75,The New Times (Kigali),9/21/10,Media Urged to Fight Corruption,,RWANDA (90%),Newspaper,Stevenson Mugisha,ENGLISH,,,21-Sep-10,"KIGALI, RWANDA (56%)",184  words,CORRUPTION (94%); JOURNALISM (90%); WRITERS (90%); NEWS REPORTING (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (86%); HOTELS & MOTELS (56%) Rwanda; Press and Media; Crime and Corruption,"MEDIA practitioners have been urged to take up a leadership role in the fight against corruption. The call was made yesterday by Ombudsman Tito Rutaremara, while addressing over 40 journalists from various local media organizations at the opening of a three-day workshop on the role of journalists in fighting against corruption and injustice at Alpha Palace Hotel, Kigali. ""I advise you to take responsibility of fighting against corruption and injustice among Rwandans because this is a crosscutting issue that requires everyone's contribution,"" he said, adding that journalists should desist from reporting stories based on rumours and instead carry out thorough investigation. The Ombudsman said his office had trained the population on how to report corruption cases, particularly through the use of the existing ICT tele-centres. He said his office had not received any complaint of extortion by a journalist and called on the public to report such cases, should they arise. Rutaremara said since February his office had received over 200 corruption cases and over 9,000 injustice cases across the country."76,The Namibian (Windhoek),9/24/10,Is 'State-Sponsored Corruption' On the Up?

We have seen BEE entities (close to the ruling political party) buying shares in State companies. Today, many of these BEE managers have become business tycoons, and they now even exercise a strong influence on parliamentary decisions and continue to lobby for legislation that will ultimately secure their own wealth. We have also seen State-run companies (public enterprises) remain a playground for post-election party bargaining, with top company posts offered as a reward to loyal party supporters, and very often as cash cows. Talk of Air Namibia, NamPower, NamWater and many others. First it was the attempted GIPF takeover by a company of political elites now it's a consortium vying to supply 50 per cent of all fuel in Namibia to replace Glencore as Namcor's partner. Who knows what will be next? There is nothing wrong with Namibians trying to have a stake in Namcor, GIPF or any other State institution, especially when such Namibian companies are guided by the tenets of hard work and have the necessary expertise, but the question is: does the current political leadership allow for transparency to guide such a highly charged political process? It seems plausible to say our Government is now in the business of benefiting only the wealthy and the corrupt politicians. One wonders whether we have a 'people's party any more'. It seems as if political corruption has become so ingrained in Namibian politics to the extent of constituting some form of a political institution. I think what we see is that the political scene in Namibia today is a neo-patrimonial form of governance that is characterised by this 'official corruption' and patron-client relations that is forever seeking to take over the formal operations of the State. At the surface level, one notices that there is some appearance of some political will and power to fight organised corruption, but in actual sense there is no real power anymore because the events we continue to witness are aimed at making a few well-connected individuals rich and ignore the plight of the masses. I am not surprised that in this environment, characteristic of institutional weaknesses such as the ACC, that the political elites will not stop at nothing until they loot every last bit of wealth that this country has. What we are witnessing is what I call 'state-sponsored corruption' because the political leadership has allowed this moral degradation to carry on unabated. I call it 'state-sponsored corruption' because our hard-won constitutional democracy is used to advance the selfish economic gain of private individuals. It's a form of political corruption because the behaviour of public officials (leaders of trade unions and youth groups) has deviated from the public interest to serve their private ends. Sad to note is the fact that Namibia with its so called anti-corruption laws is a victim of selective enforcement of corruption laws. When you start to see that Government implements policies which burden the majority of disadvantaged groups in society to the benefit of the wealthier minority, you must know that such a government is reducing its own legitimacy and anarchy is on its way. When a political system becomes blurred in separating public and private resources, then know for a fact that the political leadership has lost its vision. The strange thing about these BEE consortiums is that they are presented to the public as broad social compacts, allegedly incorporating the interests of diverse groups, including disenfranchised groups. But in actual fact, these BEE entities are just but a cast of political elites who are after the country's riches under deceptive names and initiatives. If Government allows these BEE companies to co-own Namcor, it is actually a clear sign that our own leaders are implementing policies which increase inequality instead of reducing it. Whereas in more developed and equitable societies the reaction to economic unfairness such as this might take the form of public demonstrations and political pressure, in a developing country like Namibia with a high unequal distribution of wealth, the reaction to such unfairness will take the form of distrust in political institutions, especially the ruling party. Slowly but surely, when the masses get fed up with this state-sponsored corruption, we might witness very disturbing reactions from society. I have always argued that democracy has distinctive shortcomings that are made worse by the deception that Namibia enjoys a transparent leadership. What makes matters worse is that when political elites take over State companies without the nation's interests at heart we will witness a poor record of service delivery, and new opportunities of corruption will be the norm of the day. It's time that Namibians learn to demand more than free and fair elections alone. We need to demand that between elections our political leaders be responsive and accountable to the nation. Unless otherwise convinced, I am left to conclude that the formal rules for popular political accountability have become persistently weak in this country. There are a number of steps that can be taken to avoid or minimise 'political corruption', but all depend on having leaders with a strong political will. Such steps include greater transparency across all areas of Government, and having a better oversight of State-run companies and public tenders."77,The New Times (Kigali),9/24/10,Journalists Set Up Anti-Corruption Committee,,RWANDA (78%),Newspaper,Stevenson Mugisha,ENGLISH,,,24-Sep-10,"KIGALI, RWANDA (73%)",139  words,CORRUPTION (92%); JOURNALISM (90%); WRITERS (90%); HOTELS & MOTELS (73%) Rwanda; Press and Media; Crime and Corruption,"day media workshop on corruption concluded, yesterday, at Alpha Palace Hotel in Kigali, with participants putting in place a journalists' committee that will spearhead the media's role in the fight against corruption in the country.

He also expressed concern over the increase in corruption. This assessment of the realities of the situation on the ground in Sierra Leone is of course not a fantasy but authentic. It should be treated by government with every degree of seriousness. Presently many aspects of government's focus delve around efforts to celebrate in grand style the country's 50th Independence anniversary and the re-election of the APC Government to a second term mandate. Indeed it will equally pay dividends to government's popularity ratings, and positioning for the 50th independence day celebrations, and for efforts to receive a second term mandate on a silver platter, if government increases initiatives in the areas of job creation for the youth; health, tourism, agriculture, education, road construction etc with the interest of the nation paramount over all other parochial considerations. Certainly the saying goes that a hungry man cannot stand especially in these days of global economic doldrums as a result of decline in food, petroleum and other basic commodities on the world market. As President Ernest Bai Koroma has been hinting, we must be faster and on the move to catch up with the realities and challenges of national development. Every Sierra Leonean should be involved in the patriotic duty of monitoring the prices of basic commodities on the local market to mitigate the tricks of unscrupulous business people. Business people should especially take note of the dangers in toying or hiking the prices of commodities that are not affected by the Goods and Services Tax (GST)  such as rice, pepper, palm oil, banana, cassava etc, at least as a patriotic duty. What is worth noting about youth employment is that there had been more rhetoric than positive actions on the ground in the interest of the people. The deposed SLPP government appears to have re-oriented its policies in favour of youth employment by laying some foundations such as the establishment of the Youth Employment Scheme (YES) and by opening its account at the Sierra Leone Commercial Bank (SLCB) with funds provided by the UNDP. One aspect of the SLPP regime's approach in resolving the problem was to diversify youth job creation initiatives among various stakeholders such as the Ministry of Youth and Sports, Ministry of Labour, Education, Economic and Development Planning as well as the National Commission for Social Action (NaCSA), the Sierra Leone Roads Authority etc. But when the APC Regime came to power, they had not wanted to put old wines in new bottles. Thus they introduced the new approach of dissolving the Ministry of Youth and Sports and devolving its functions to that of the Ministry of Education as well as announcing the establishment of the National Youth Commission (NYC), an agency for coordinating youth employment activities in the country. Unfortunately up to now only the last of the members of the Board of Directors of the NYC has been nominated and confirmed by Parliament; the Act creating the NYC has also been ratified by Parliament. The NYC however is yet to become operational due to administrative red-tapes. Another important loophole in the youth employment saga in the country is the overlapping of functions among various stakeholders, something that should be nipped in the bud before the NYC becomes operational. Many observers feel that it is time government unravels the mystery that was behind why the Youth Employment Scheme (YES) fund that the SLPP left at the SLCB had to be later returned to the UNDP donors for safekeeping? What happened is that there was a conflict of interest in who should control the fund that became visible between the Ministry of Finance, Education, Labour, NaCSA etc. This is because of the stigma of overlapping of functions and the lack of comprehensive coordination and personality cult among certain government officials, the fund had to be retrieved by the UNDP for safe-keeping. The UNIPSIL latest report equally mentioned that the number of corruption cases to the Anti-Corruption Commission had increased in recent times instead of decreasing. Indeed one of the crucial challenges facing the ACC had often been political interference that compromises its independence as a neutral body. During the SLPP era the pendulum was swinging in favour of SLPP political stalwarts in government as government was sometimes giving blind eyes to their shortcomings while castigating others from other political parties. This was something that cast ugly aspersions on the performance of the party. Today a similar scenario is unfolding as despite that the APC Regime had updated and reviewed its mandate to conform to changing realities there are still evidences of APC-SLPP power rivalry in the way corruption cases are being handled. This is why the issue of some senior government officials especially opposition party officials such as the Minority Leader, Hon. Momoh Pujeh and the Minister of Lands, Housing and the Environment Dr. Dennis Sandy failing to declare their assets ought to be treated as a constitutional obligation and national concern rather than with party politics allegiance."81,The Namibian (Windhoek),10/15/10,Noa and Erna Get Another Term at Anti-Corruption Commission,,NAMIBIA (79%),Newspaper,Brigitte Weidlich,ENGLISH,,,19-Oct-10,,61  words,LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); PRIME MINISTERS (87%) Namibia; Crime and Corruption,"THE director and deputy director of the Anti-Corruption Commission will stay in their posts for another five years.

The FEACC arrested 43 suspects during a raid conducted in different areas of the city in October 2010. At their appearance in front of the Federal High Court First Criminal Bench within 48 hours of the raid, the police requested more time to conduct its investigation. The hearing was adjourned to November 9, when investigators again asked for more time, which the court granted, adjourning the case until this week. In the interim, 25 of the suspects were released due to lack of evidence, according to Gelanan Asefa, advisor of Public Relations for the FEACC. ""Some were just employees,"" he told Fortune. The others were denied bail because the investigation involves corruption, for which bail rights are denied. ""The Anti-corruption Commission is involved because employees of the Ethiopian Telecommunications Corporation (ETC) are suspected of involvement in these businesses,"" Gelanan told Fortune. Many small businesses in the city charge less than ETC for international calls. While ETC charges 12.65 Br per minute, the prices of these businesses, using various Voice-over IP (VoIP) software, depend on the country and mode of communication used: land line or wireless.

While it is undoubtedly so that the GIPF misallocations of millions in loans is a matter of huge concern, this is by no means the only, or the worst, example of misappropriated monies. It does concern the pension monies of civil servants, which is certainly the reason GIPF is featuring more prominently than other financial scandals, but it is also clear that the pensions themselves are not at risk. For the National Union of Namibian Workers (NUNW) therefore to confine their proposed protest action simply to demand the suspension of GIPF trustees, could quite conceivably be a waste of time and resources. If their stance concerned corruption in general, and calling Government to account for all the missing monies, it may be a wake-up call for the ruling party in a country where graft is clearly increasing. This in spite of the window-dressing of a so-called zero tolerance approach and an Anti Corruption Commission (ACC), among others. The newly appointed 'media' advisor to President Hifikepunye Pohamba, Mukwaita Shanyengana, has condemned the planned mass protests as 'premature', adding that they ""would only disrupt the provision of services and affect the national economy negatively. For this reason, President Pohamba would find it difficult to accept a petition from the workers in this regard. He added that President Pohamba did not in any way condone misappropriation of funds at GIPF or any other Government institution, and also wanted to get 'to the bottom' of the matter. The President has been joined in his opposition to the planned mass protests by other key Government officials, and most recently Cabinet Secretary, Frans Kapofi, warned government permanent secretaries against granting leave to public servants who wanted to protest next Wednesday. The Constitution obviously gives Namibians the rights to peaceful protest and demonstrations and the standoff between NUNW and Government on this matter was not resolved at the time this editorial was written. There is merit in the arguments on both sides of the coin. But Namibia and Namibians have probably not yet spoken out clearly enough against corruption in all its manifestations, and the proposed protest therefore, should not simply be confined to GIPF alone. There have been times and occasions in the past where the NUNW and other unions have been complicit in their silence over corruption and graft, and their voice must be unequivocal on this issue. If the civil service, and all Namibians by extension, are serious about combating corruption, then they should also be prepared to sacrifice to this end, if necessary, demonstrating over a lunch hour or on a weekend to show that they are serious. Corruption after all, affects everyone in Namibia and not the civil service alone. We would support a strong stand by the civil service, the unions and all Namibians against corruption, and a call for Government to account on all missing monies, the GIPF funds included, and should not be selective when it comes to such protests."87,The New Times (Kigali),11/11/10,EAC - Fight Against Corruption Stepped Up [opinion],,AFRICA (97%); BURUNDI (95%); KENYA (94%); EASTERN AFRICA (93%); RWANDA (79%) East Africa,Newspaper,Frank Tanganika,ENGLISH,,,12-Nov-10,"BUJUMBURA, BURUNDI (79%); NAIROBI, KENYA (79%)",841  words,CORRUPTION (90%); PASSPORTS & VISAS (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); NOVELS & SHORT STORIES (75%); SURGERY & TRANSPLANTATION (73%); WRITERS (69%); POLICE FORCES (66%) Rwanda; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Is Africa, at last, wriggling out of the clutches of corruption? This question has been inspired by recent declarations of zero tolerance by governments in the East African region to the evil that has bedeviled the continent for far too long. The vice of corruption may not be of African descent but the continent has appropriated it and its extent, both in depth and breadth, on the continent, has surpassed the levels of whoever might have invented or pioneered it. African scholars, notably Chinua Achebe, were disturbed by the extent of corruption practiced by the new African leadership during the early days of independent Africa. In his novel, A man of the people published in 1960s, Like Kenyan writer Ngugi wa Thiongo in Petals of Blood, Achebe explicitly showed how our leaders colluded with agents of neocolonialism to exploit, not only African resources, but also to undermine the dreams of Uhuru Africans had fought for; The dreams of prosperity, dignity, equity and equality ad infinitum. Corruption is indeed a cancer that slowly eats in the social fabric, and when not diagnosed, and treated early would need a major surgical operation that may entail severing off the affected organs. As it is now, the operation at this stage calls for the most senior surgeons - the ladies and gentlemen occupying the highest dockets of our governments. The presidents, the judges, senators, members of parliament, cabinet ministers and ministers of the church. Starting from Burundi which fared badly in the recent corruption rating by Transparency International, I was impressed by President Pierre Nkurunziza's declaration of zero tolerance to corruption (Igiturire), which has been roundly applauded by Burundians at home and abroad. One gentleman said on BBC Imvo n'Imvano Kinyarwanda/ Kirundi programme that he had to leave his country because he saw no future in a country so corrupt, echoing the Achebe and Ngugi premonition decades back, that corruption and inept leadership were bound to be serious impediments to postcolonial progress. The story told by the Burundian was indeed more absurd than the fictional character of Chief Nanga in A Man of the People. Having lost his passport abroad and equipped with necessary documentations from his Embassy, the gentleman returned to Bujumbura to apply for a new passport but he was stunned by a passport officer who rejected his photographs on the grounds that they were so clear t that hey could not have been taken in Burundi. This serves to show how corruption has been entrenched in Africa. Stories of corruption on the continent abound, so in this article we use only two countries for the purpose of illustration. In Burundi, like in Kenya, there are specialized institutions to fight corruption which include special police forces and courts. The integrity centre in Nairobi houses the Kenya Anti-corruption Commission. These institutions can only work effectively if the leadership does not merely pay lip service to war against the vice. How do we exterminate the culture of ""man eateth where man worketh""? The answer can only be found in total commitment at all levels and of course civic education. During the corruption debates on BBC in the last two weeks, Rwanda was repeatedly cited as exemplary. Although I don't have any corruption indices to be able to tell levels of corruption, as a person who lives in Rwanda, I know that the leadership has no tolerance for corruption. I have seen big shots in real trouble-that is deterrent enough, but also, in addition, there has evolved anti -corruption discourse that reminds us all of the evil. Kenya seems to have taken the fight against corruption to the highest quarters, with both the Executive and Parliament determined to show the way. Three ministers have been suspended to pave the way for investigations and a number of Permanent Secretaries and parastatal bosses have been sidelined or face charges related to corruption. Kenya's re-energized war against corruption has won praise from other countries and will certainly improve business and investment opportunities. I have heard a few social friends trying to rationalize corruption saying that it sometimes helps individuals out of problems. That is double faced corruption because it used to impinge on laws established to regulate society. There is no good or bad corruption and, as veteran Kenyan Politician, Koigi wa Wamwere, wrote in The Daily Nation of 4th November, corruption is theft whether we conceal it in unclear terms like misappropriation and corrupt people are, simply, thieves. They steal from the public who are the losers if roads and other infrastructure are 'eaten', hospitals working below capacity; schools are inadequate because some individuals have to satisfy their unquenchable lust for wealth. The war against the evil can only be won if the men and women in top public positions, the media and civil society, show incorruptible integrity themselves. It is only then that Africa will occupy a decent position it deserves in the international community."88,The New Times (Kigali),11/22/10,EAC Must Battle Corruption to Promote Trade - Kiraso,,EASTERN AFRICA (95%); BURUNDI (92%); AFRICA (79%) East Africa,Newspaper,Gashegu Muramira,ENGLISH,,,22-Nov-10,"BUJUMBURA, BURUNDI (92%)",326  words,CORRUPTION (92%); RULE OF LAW (89%); HUMAN RIGHTS (87%); ETHICS (78%); FINANCIAL CRIME COUNTERMEASURES (78%); CRIMINAL LAW (77%); TALKS & MEETINGS (73%); EXTRADITION (73%); NONTARIFF BARRIERS (72%); TAXES & TAXATION (70%) Trade; Crime and Corruption,"The Deputy Secretary General of the East African Community (EAC), Beatrice Kiraso, has reaffirmed the bloc's commitment to fighting corruption, saying the vice is negatively affecting trade in the region. The official made the remarks during the just concluded East African Law Society annual general meeting in Bujumbura, Burundi. While emphasizing that corruption is an evil that undermines development and provision of social services, Kiraso said that the challenge has not been the absence of instruments to fight the vice at national level, but implementation and enforceability. ""It increases the cost of doing business and in the case of EAC it can be a non-tariff barrier to trade,"" she said. ""To effectively market the EAC as a single tourist and investment destination and trade zone and to negotiate effectively as a bloc in international fora, it calls for high levels of integrity, transparency and accountability."" Kiraso added that a protocol on preventing and combating corruption has been developed covering asset recovery and forfeiture, transfer of criminals and criminal proceedings among other key provisions. The protocol provides for extradition, judicial cooperation and mutual legal assistance and establishes a financial intelligence unit. On human rights, Kiraso said that the EAC notes the need for harmonisation of strategies and benchmarks in the region towards promotion and protection of human rights, adding that the EAC regional plan of action is under development. ""In this regard, the extension of jurisdiction of the East African Court of Justice to include human rights is pertinent,"" she added. The regional bloc has developed a draft protocol on good governance with four pillars which include; constitutionalism, rule of law and access to justice, democracy and democratization processes. Others are; protection and promotion of human rights and equal opportunities; and combating corruption and enhancing ethics and integrity."89,The New Times (Kigali),11/23/10,Joint Efforts Will Eradicate Corruption Within EAC,,"RWANDA (94%); EASTERN AFRICA (93%); BURUNDI (79%); UGANDA (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (79%); KENYA (79%); AFRICA (79%) East Africa",Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,23-Nov-10,,322  words,"CORRUPTION (92%); BUDGETS (90%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (89%); POLLS & SURVEYS (73%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (72%); BEST PRACTICES (64%) Rwanda; Economy, Business and Finance","The Deputy Secretary General of the East African Community (EAC) last week announced that the Economic Bloc Has Developed a Protocol On Preventing And Combating Corruption in the Five Member States. Research has indicated that corruption levels vary drastically across the EAC member states. According to a recent survey by Transparency International, Rwanda is the least corrupt in the EAC region, with only 6 percent of its national budget believed to be lost, yearly, through corrupt tendencies, while Burundi was found the most corrupt where graft was rated at 38 percent of the country's total national income. Uganda was rated the second most corrupt, losing an average total of 36 percent of its national income to graft, Kenya came third with an estimated 29 percent of national income lost annually through corruption, while Tanzania emerged the second least corruption in the bloc, losing about 28 percent of national income to corrupt officials. When added up, EAC member states lose an average 27 percent of their national budgets to corruption. In monetary terms, corruption in the EAC region runs into billions of US dollars. These funds, if well spent, can greatly improve the livelihoods of the EAC citizens. With such levels of corruption, the situation is worrisome for potential investors, who are targeting EAC as a single investment destination. If EAC is to succeed in attracting major investments and if it's to become a model economic bloc for the rest of the continent, there must be a deliberate effort from each member state to genuinely tackle corruption. The EAC Secretariat should actively encourage member states to share experiences, and to learn best practices from each other. The region also needs to put more emphasis on homegrown initiatives, which have evidently helped contain the vice in Rwanda. The EAC people share common challenges and aspirations, and need common strategies to defeat corruption."90,The Herald (Harare),11/24/10,Corruption Rocks Council,,ZIMBABWE (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,25-Nov-10,,356  words,HOUSING AUTHORITIES (90%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%); CITY GOVERNMENT (90%); AUDITS (90%); CITIES (78%); NATIONAL IDENTITY CARDS (71%) Zimbabwe; Crime and Corruption,"Bulawayo City Council has unearthed a scam in which a housing administrative assistant is accused of corruptly issuing nine stands to her fianc and his relatives. An audit team has called for the suspension of administrative assistant, Mrs Sindiso Luphahla, and all her supervisors (directors in the housing department), who failed to see the irregularities. According to a council investigative audit report, Mrs Luphahla allegedly used her position to identify repossessed stands and gave these to her fianc, Mr Mbhekinkosi Macleans Moyo. Mrs Luphahla would falsify information submitted to council committees, resulting in council making the wrong decisions, it is alleged. She allegedly allocated stands 16534 in Nkulumane, 74594 Lobengula and 967, 833 and 1454 all in Mahatshula Suburb, to Mr Moyo and his relatives. She further facilitated for her fianc to get stand number 631 Killarney, 1851 Selborne Park, 22551 Cowdray Park and commercial stand 15463 Kelvin North, it is alleged. ""There were also instances where council allocation procedures were violated. Compounding factors of the above problems are weak supervisory controls and a lack of procedure manuals,"" read part of the report. Town clerk Mr Middleton Nyoni ordered the investigation. During the investigation, Mr Moyo claimed that one of the directors in the housing department was his uncle. The said director vehemently denied the claim and threatened to sue over the statement, saying Mr Moyo could have made it thinking it would make council show him leniency. The report says Ms Minenhle Moyo, Mr Moyo's sister, forged a national identity document to obtain two housing registry forms. She allegedly used one of the forms to buy stand 833 in Mahatshula. It further reveals that Mr Moyo only paid less than half of the required deposit for stand 631 Killarney against council regulations that demand the full deposit. He settled the balance on the deposit 10 months later in 2007. The audit team called for council to deal with Mrs Luphala's supervisors for failing to detect her misdeeds and that she should not be allowed to deal with any matters related to housing."92,The Namibian (Windhoek),11/30/10,Corruption Alleged at Central Prison,,NAMIBIA (94%),Newspaper,Tileni Mongudhi,ENGLISH,,,6-Dec-10,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (72%)",370  words,PRISONS (90%); HOUSING ASSISTANCE (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); CORRECTIONS (90%); CORRECTIONS WORKERS (78%); RESIDENTIAL RENTAL PROPERTY (78%); COMMERCIAL RENTAL PROPERTY (67%) Namibia; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"A SENIOR Prison Service official has been accused of receiving a housing allowance although he has been living in a State-owned house for more than a year. Senior Assistant Commissioner Raphael Marobera is said to have been living in a government house at the Windhoek Central Prison despite being promoted from Chief Superintendent to Senior Assistant Commissioner late last year. The post he holds is equivalent to that of a director in other government ministries. Government rules dictate that senior officials who receive housing and car allowances are not allowed to stay in government houses. They are also not allowed to drive government cars unless in special circumstances. Government officials who receive housing and car allowances start from deputy director level, in this case Assistant Commissioner. Government officials at that level earn a monthly housing allowance of about N$5 220, or N$62 640 a year. Under the Public Service Act, senior government officials should not receive a housing allowance while occupying a government house rent-free. Although it is a disciplinary matter under the Public Service Act, it is regarded as a crime under the Anti-Corruption Act. Marobera said although he was staying in a government house, he was paying ""full commercial rent"" for the house. He would not tell The Namibian how much rent he was paying and referred the question to the Ministry of Safety and Security. The ministry could not provide the figure by the time of going to press. Marobera added that it was difficult for him to get private accommodation since he is from Tanzania and his contract is renewed every second year. Safety and Security permanent secretary Samuel Goagoseb said he did not know of the allegations but would find out and if they were true, he would take the appropriate steps against Marobera. The Namibian got wind of the allegations after angry prison wardens complained that they were being evicted from the prison compound due to renovations while Marobera was staying in a government house at their expense. More than 30 wardens were told early this month that they have less than a month to vacate their barracks by the end of this month to make way for renovations to the buildings."98,The New Times (Kigali),12/2/10,Corruption Rampant at Grassroots - Ombudsman,,RWANDA (92%),Newspaper,Paul Ntambara,ENGLISH,,,2-Dec-10,"KIGALI, RWANDA (50%)",363  words,CORRUPTION (94%); BRIBERY (78%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (78%) Rwanda; Crime and Corruption,"The fight against corruption in high leadership organs has registered great progress, but the vice is still rampant at the lower administrative levels, the Ombudsman, Tito Rutaremara, has said. Rutaremara was speaking on the sidelines of an anti- corruption music and poetry competition, organised by his office, in the Southern Province, on Tuesday. The Ombudsman observed that corruption at the higher levels, which mainly involves large sums of money, particularly through public tenders, had gone down. He said that the challenge still remains in the middle and lower levels where people have to bribe their way to access services which they are otherwise entitled to without any pay. ""They pay very little, but this is dangerous because it gradually develops into a habit and then a culture,"" Rutaremara said. ""The challenge we have is to sensitise the population so that they know their rights and are ready to resist corruption. People need to come out and resist corruption, fight for their rights and be whistle blowers,"" he added. In reference to the ongoing music and poetry competition, Rutaremara, said that songs and poems are an important medium to convey anti-corruption messages. He pointed out that the medium serves as a major mobilising tool on how to fight corruption and other forms of injustices. ""Corruption destroys good governance; people should be aware so that they reject and fight it."" The competition started at district level where the best two - in each of the categories (songs and poems) - moved to the next stage, at the provincial level. Winners from each of the four provinces and Kigali City will then compete at the national level on December 7. The competition was also in preparation for the anti-corruption week which started yesterday, and is expected to end on December 9. It will, however, be officially launched in Gisagara District on December 6.

He made the remarks yesterday while speaking at the Northern Corridor Stakeholders Consultative Forum that brought together participants from the transport corridor linking the Great Lakes countries of Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda to the Kenyan sea port of Mombasa, Tanzania and Ethiopia. The forum aimed at evaluating how far member countries have gone in overcoming bottlenecks to facilitate trade along the corridor and lay strategies of what is needed to ensure efficient trade facilitation. ""Traders complain that government agencies operating along the corridor ask them for bribes and when we are ask the traders to help us and eradicate the vice within the corridor they are not co-operative,"" Waweru said. He added that when they take measures to remove interaction between the traders and the various government agencies operating along the corridor, for example by using electronic cargo transport system which eliminates the transit monitoring unit, traders say that it is expensive for them. ""The cost of corruption is lot more to the economy and to individual traders and when we ask the traders to pay 1,000 dollars to install electronic cargo tracking gadget, they don't want and prefer to bribe the police and customs officers,"" Waweru explained He called upon stakeholders along the corridor to do their best to bring corruption to an end. According to Eugene Torero, the Deputy Commissioner General and Commissioner for Customs at RRA, a lot has been done to promote the efficient trade facilitation along the corridor, including the introduction of one stop border post. ""Key initiatives for instance the 24 hour operation along borders like Gatuna, Gisenyi- Congo border, Maraba border and Mombasa port, have had significant impact on reducing clearance time,"" he noted. Officiating at the meeting, Marie Clare Mukasine the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Infrastructure said that transit facilitation which includes simplification and harmonisation of customs procedures and removal of non-tariff barriers needs to be emphasised. She pointed out the numerous non-tariff barriers along the Northern Corridor including weigh bridges, roadblocks, insecurity, differing axle road limits and cash bonds. ""It is our responsibility to work jointly towards addressing challenges that impede streamlined trade facilitation along the corridor."" The meeting will address more challenges affecting the corridor and draw sustainable strategies that will promote trade facilitation, free and secure business environment as well as reducing the cost of doing business in the region.

Liberia is the most corrupt state on the face of the earth in the most corrupt region of the world-sub-Saharan Africa. Who is to blame? Hard to say, but let's start with archaic and useless state socio-economic institutions spanning over decades. Impunity, the absence of tolerance that resulted into people being shot or jailed for suggesting that their government and its officials were corrupt. Now that it is possible to say so and roam freely, and now that international organizations can come, roam and collect the their findings, the facts are hitting at the country in an ominous way. Thus to suggest that the foundations of these findings were laid in 2006 when this government climbed to power would be ignoring the facts and the country's hyper-corrupt history. The basis of these findings can be found in the country's history, more in its destructive war, and more so in the misrule that greeted it from 1980 when soldiers seized power with slogans of anti-corruption they hardly understood or believed in. No single person can bear the burdens for this verdict. It is a collective burden rooted in history. The verdict says all institutions in the country, without exception, are corrupt. The findings also presented some surprises. Contrary to what many believe, women are more likely to offer bribes to beat the system than men, TI said. So are women more corrupt? But the most corrupt institution in the country, according to the verdict, is the police force. It scored a whooping 4.1%. Next, not surprisingly, is the Legislature, scoring 3.9%. Then comes the Education system, scoring 3.8%. It is followed by the Judiciary, netting 3.7%. After that come public officials--Ministers, Directors of Public Corporations, etc., scoring 3.6%. The next are the non-governmental organizations - the NGOs, and these include UN groups, too. They scored 2.5%. They are followed by the media, netting 2.4%. Other lesser champions are: political parties, 2.9%. NGOS, 2.5 and the Military, 2.3%. Religious bodies scored the leased - 1.9%. To understand the above figures in relations to the intensity of corruption, TI says: ""A 2% of any of the above denotes the severity of corruption and no change in attitude while beyond 2% underscores how extreme corruption has become."" With this, corruption is extreme in all institutions, although some rank higher. Hence, Legislators are more corrupt than ministers. The Judiciary, including lawyers, is more corrupt than ministers. The NGOs are more corrupt than the media. The political parties are more corrupt than the media, too. All this suggests that corrupt is pervasive in the society with exclusion. Sub-Saharan Africa Country: Percent: Liberia.......................................89% Uganda.....................................86% Sierra Leone ..............................71% Nigeria .....................................63% Senegal .....................................56% Cameroon .................................54% Zambia......................................42% Ghana.......................................37% Transparency International conducted its 2010 Global Corruption Barometer studies through RMS-Africa firm, which interviewed 750 Liberians covering the urban areas which represent the population of 856,516 and cover the June 21-June 26 2010. The methodology used was face to face. The sectors of the Liberian society covered in the studies included where in society corruption is prevalent and experienced change in corruption pattern. According to Transparency International Global Corruption Barometer of 2010, 80% of Sub-Saharan Africa are willing to engage to fight corruption while 50% say government is corrupt but 45% trust the government to fight corruption. Despite these results, the survey also found that seven out of 10 people would be willing to report an incident of corruption. ""The fall-out of the financial crises continues to affect people's opinions of corruption, particular in Europe and North America. Institutions everywhere must be resolute in their efforts to restore good governance and trust,"" said Huguette Labelle, Chair of Transparency International. ""It is heartening that so many people are ready to take a stand against corruption. This willingness must be mobilised."" The 2010 Global Corruption Barometer surveys more than 91,000 people in 86 countries and territories. It focuses on petty bribery, perceptions of public institutions and views of whom people trust to combat corruption. The survey showed that in the past 12 months one in four people paid a bribe to one of nine institutions and services, from health to education to tax authorities. The police are named the most frequent recipient of bribes, according to those surveyed, with 29 per cent of those who had contact with the police reporting that they paid a bribe. Sub-Saharan Africans report paying the most bribes: more than one in two people report paying a bribe in the past 12 months. This compares to 36 per cent of people surveyed in the Middle East and North Africa, 32 per cent in the Newly Independent states, 23 per cent in Latin America, 19 per cent in the Western Balkans and Turkey, 11 per cent in Asia Pacific and just 5 per cent in European Union countries and North America. More than 20 countries report significantly more petty bribery than in 2006, when the same question was asked in the Barometer. The biggest number of reported bribery payments in 2010 is in Afghanistan, Cambodia, Cameroon, India, Iraq, Liberia, Nigeria, Palestine, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Uganda where more than 50 per cent of people surveyed paid a bribe in the past 12 months. Almost half of all respondents say they paid bribes to avoid problems with the authorities and a quarter say it was to speed up processes. Most worrying is the fact that bribes to the police have almost doubled since 2006, and more people report paying bribes to the judiciary and for registry and permit services than did so five years ago. The demographics of bribery continue to disadvantage the poor and the young. As in past surveys, lower income earners report paying more bribes than higher income earners. Poorer people are twice as likely to pay bribes for basic services, such as utilities, medical services and education, than wealthier people. ""Corruption is a regressive tax. This injustice must be addressed. The marginalised and poor remain the most vulnerable to extortion. Governments should do more to identify corruption risks in basic services and to protect their citizens,"" said Labelle. A third of all people under the age of 30 report paying a bribe in the past 12 months, compared to less than one in five people over 51 years of age. Sadly, few people trust their governments or politicians. Eight out of 10 say political parties are corrupt or extremely corrupt. The civil service and parliament are considered the next most corrupt institutions. Half the people questioned say their government's action to stop corruption is ineffective. This reflects little change over time; however, opinions have worsened slightly since 2007 in Asia Pacific, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa - while they have improved in the Newly Independent States and North America. And although a large majority of people - seven out of 10 - say they would report a corrupt act if they saw one, if they are victims of corruption, this drops to about half. ""The message from the 2010 Barometer is that corruption is insidious. It makes people lose faith. The good news is that people are ready to act,"" said Labelle. ""Better whistleblower protection and greater access to information are crucial. Public engagement in the fight against corruption will force those in authority to act; and will give people further courage to speak out and stand up for a cleaner, more transparent world,"" she added."110,The New Times (Kigali),1/12/11,Nyagatare Intensifies Anti-Corruption Efforts,,RWANDA (79%),Newspaper,Dan Ngabonziza,ENGLISH,,,12-Jan-11,,200  words,CORRUPTION (95%) Rwanda; Crime and Corruption,"The Nyagatare Intermediate Court, on Tuesday, reaffirmed its commitment to uproot corruption as it announced a week long anti-corruption campaign in Nyagatare and Gatsibo districts.

The Baster traditional leader's comments follow the rejection of a motion by Swapo councillors that was tabled by Martin Dentlinger last week Thursday. The motion dealt with incidents of alleged fraud, theft, corruption, gross negligence and incompetence in the Rehoboth Town Council. Dentlinger, a member of the United People's Movement, said the issues raised in the motion contravened various sections of the Local Authorities Act and the Anti-Corruption Act. McNab said the town council ""lost a golden opportunity to take a principle stance against corruption, theft and other evils"". Lambasting the Swapo councillors who voted in a block against the motion, he said ""this was an opportunity for the newly elected councillors to distance themselves from the incriminating evidence against their predecessors"" contained in the Adonai report . The Adonai report was commissioned last year to investigate corrupt practices at the local authority, which is now in possession of the council. Dentlinger's motion was based on the report, NcNab said. Swapo councillor Colleen van Wyk moved ""for the rejection of the motion in its totality"". Van Wyk based her counter-motion on a number of technicalities in terms of the Council's Standing Rules of Order. The motion was seconded by another Swapo councillor, Eve Maasdorp. As a result of the outright rejection of the motion, the merits of the issues raised in the motion could not be discussed. When put to the vote, three opposition councillors - two from UPM and one RDP - voted in favour and their entire Swapo bench consisting of four councillors opposed the motion. McNab said the motion was an open invitation for the new councillors to ""join forces to fight corruption""."112,The Namibian (Windhoek),1/28/11,Global Aids Fund Says No to Corruption,,NAMIBIA (93%); GERMANY (90%); UNITED STATES (79%); FRANCE (74%),Newspaper,Denver Kisting,ENGLISH,,,31-Jan-11,,356  words,AIDS & HIV (94%); CORRUPTION (91%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); MALARIA (90%); TUBERCULOSIS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (89%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (78%); VOLUNTARY HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS (78%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (78%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (77%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (77%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (77%); EXECUTIVES (75%); CHARITIES (73%); PUBLIC POLICY (73%); SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE (73%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (72%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (72%) Namibia; NGOs and Civil Society; HIV-Aids and STDs; Tuberculosis; Malaria; Crime and Corruption; Sustainable Development,"THE Global Fund announced this week that it ""has zero tolerance for corruption and actively seeks to uncover the misuse of funds"". The international funder of projects to fight AIDS, TB and malaria said it ""deploys rigorous procedures to detect fraud and fight corruption of any organisation financing development"". The Global Fund recently withdrew all its financial support to Lironga Eparu, a Namibian HIV-AIDS charity. Moses Ikanga, Lironga Eparu's board chairperson, said last week the support was pulled as a result of personal grudges against executive director Emma Tuahepa. But Global Fund boss Michel Kazatchkine this week said: ""Transparency is a guiding principle behind the work of the Global Fund and we expect to be held to the highest standards of accountability."" The Global Fund currently demands the recovery of an unaccounted amount of US$34 million in some of its donor countries. Germany's development ministry said yesterday it would halt all payments to the Global Fund until it got answers about corruption allegations. The Associated Press reported on Sunday that the fund's new investigative unit found high percentages of contract money eaten up by corruption. Germany is the fund's third largest government donor behind the US and France. Ikanga on Friday said they plan to brief President Hifikepunye Pohamba, Lironga Eparu's patron, on the dire straits it finds itself in because of the withdrawn funds. About 45 000 people living with HIV-AIDS are out in the cold after the Global Fund through the Ministry of Health and Social Services withdrew all funding to the NGO late last year. Ikanga said Lironga Eparu was instructed to review its management structure, but that it has allegedly emerged that there is a vendetta against Tuahepa. ""That change meant that Emma Tuahepa should go without valid or substantial reasons is therefore uncalled for, unconstitutional, completely unlawful. In particular, to withdraw funding and get the whole community of people living with HIV to suffer because of ulterior motives by those entrusted by us in the country goes against the Government Policy of Vision 2030,"" he said."118,The Herald (Harare),2/2/11,Why Corruption is Now Endemic [opinion],,ZIMBABWE (97%); AFRICA (94%); SOMALIA (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,7-Feb-11,,2274  words,CORRUPTION (92%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (89%); BRIBERY (89%); EXTORTION (75%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (75%); POLLS & SURVEYS (74%); ETHICS (72%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (72%); EMBEZZLEMENT (70%); RANKINGS (69%) Zimbabwe; Crime and Corruption,"A people who do not share history, who do not appreciate the shared experiences that their history and nationhood represents, are a people who cannot utilise mutual trust, dependability and a sense of unity of purpose; and this is the bane of Africa upon which lies the legendary failure to build sustainable, let alone successful economic social systems. The statement above will appeal a lot to ethicists, idealists and moralists, and of course to the multitudes of people across theworld who stand in indignation as victims of corruption by those who abuse various forms of privileges available to them by the positions to which they are entrusted by their peoples. The 2010 Transparency International corruption index ranked Zimbabwe on number 134. The index had 178 countries and Somalia was rated the most corrupt country on this planet, while Denmark stood as the least corrupt country the world over, New Zealand coming second best, UK standing at number 20 and neighbouring South Africa standing at number 54. The ratings are based on Corruption Perception Indexes (CPIs) and, of course, the margin of error is dependent on a number of factors, like publicity, politicisation and methodology of the surveys carried out. That notwithstanding, corruption in Zimbabwe and in the rest of Africa is as apparent as is Africa's poverty. One can almost touch corruption with bare hands in the African governance system. There are many forms of corruption in Zimbabwe and in Africa today and the most talked about is political corruption. This is the use of legislated powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain. On an annual basis the world has US$1 trillion paid in bribes alone. The impact of this practice on fair trade, efficiency in service delivery and accountability is, of course, phenomenally ruinous, especially in developing countries like Zimbabwe. Other forms of corruption include extortion, cronyism, nepotism, patronage, graft, embezzlement and kickbacks. In Zimbabwe it is acceptable that one influential person can publicly recruit people from his home area for employment in the private or public sector. The practice is even considered honourable by the benefiting communities. This writer once ran the placement desk for the recruitment of National Youth Service graduates and is still very alive to the expectations expressed by those from Bikita in particular, Masvingo in general and those of the Shumba Mhazi totem specifically. It was made abundantly clear to this writer that the placement desk was an unquestionable privilege for all the people of Bikita, for those from Masvingo Province and a very special honour for the people of Chirumhanzu, an area where the majority of my Shumba Mhazi clan resides. As such this writer was always inundated with visits, telephone calls and even instructions to make sure that ""our people are the first to get those jobs"". One deputy minister once paraded this writer at a rally somewhere in Masvingo Province and told the audience, ""uyu mukomana anoti kana aona maZezuru anobva akanganwa kuti akafa tisu maKaranga tichamuviga"", meaning: ""This young man gets carried away whenever he mixes up with the Zezuru people, oblivious to the fact that when he dies it is us hisKaranga people who will bury him."" That actually seemed to make a lot of sense to the audience, who looked at this prodigal son with eyes that clearly demanded either an apology or a sound explanation. This writer grinned sheepishly and took all the ""humiliation"" that came with this undressing with what could be called humility by others, certainly an admission of guilt on the part of the deputy minister's appalled audience. I stood there as the appalling forgetter of his own people. Here was one person being treated like a hopelessly treacherous son of his home community, and all for deciding to give Zimbabweans a fair opportunity in a programme that was clearly national in context. In reality we are looking at an example where there is an element of public endorsement for corrupt exclusion of other people from benefits that are meant to be for all citizens. Corruption has deadly effects on politics, administration and national institutions. It poses a serious threat to development, often stalling progress altogether, or resulting in lengthy delays in the completion of development projects. Accountability in elections and legislative bodies has been known to be grossly undermined by corruption. There were a number of voting centres in Kenya where up to 130 percent of registered voters ""cast"" votes in the ballot box in December 2007, and these polling stations had both the ruling party and the opposition benefiting. There are reports of similar happenings having taken place recently in Cote d'Ivoire's North, and these allegations form the basis for Laurent Gbagbo's argument that the Constitutional Council was right in nullifying votes from some centres to the benefit his own cause. Why the UN and others quickly announced the victory of Ouattara without investigating the claims of the Constitutional Council will remain a mystery for a long time. Corruption in the judiciary compromises the rule of law, and in Africa there are numerous allegations of selective application of the law, altering of charges to lesser offences, or undue delays in prosecuting certain offenders. Zimbabwe has had its fair share of these allegations and in some cases officials from the judiciary have been prosecuted, while others have been convicted. In public administration, corruption has often resulted in inefficient provision of services, and in Zimbabwe the urban local governments have of late become notorious for poor service delivery and hyper-corruption. There are dire economic effects resulting from corruption. In the private sector corruption increases the cost of business through the price of illicit payments, bribes and kickbacks. In the public sector bribes induce officials to contrive new rules and delays in order to manufacture crises. The cycle of manufactured crises creating artificial scarcity and exacerbating bribing has become a common way of government operations across Africa. In Zimbabwe people are often simply told, ""Sit there while we try to sort out your problem"" and they are made to wait until business closes down, and then they are told to ""come back tomorrow"". The waiting often only ends after a bribe has been paid. In some places the bribe is brazenly and publicly solicited for, even blatantly demanded. It is common to see a traffic police officer openly ordering a commuter bus operator to pay for his way past a roadblock. The news would not sell a newspaper in Zimbabwe, not in Kenya or even in South Africa. In the public sector the diversion of public investment to capital projects is quite common. This is because capital projects are notorious for the opportunity they provide for bribes and kickbacks. One of the major setbacks resulting from corruption is lack of compliance with construction, environment or any other regulations that may be in place to ensure quality. As a result government services have largely become synonymous with poor quality. In Africa, there is this unpalatable tradition of externalisation of financial capital by political leaders and other looters to overseas destinations. Nigeria had US$400 billion stolen from treasury by the country's leaders between 1960 and 1999. That is quite phenomenal. Researchers from the University of Massachusetts found out that US$187 billion was externalised by Sub-Saharan African leaders between 1970 and 1996. This massive looting was, of course, from a handful of powerful elites. Politicians often steal more in times of political instability, or when their terms of office are due to expire. Another major cause for the externalisation of financial capital by politicians is the fear of expropriation of stolen assets by new governments. Africa has many stories of new governments confiscating assets stolen by ousted politicians. So the incumbent politicians find it prudent to stash away their loot in foreign countries where they believe the loot will be out of reach. Corruption has had drastic effects on humanitarian aid. This ranges from diversion of food aid, selling of food aid, exclusion of others, to soliciting for bribes, sexual and other forms of favours. The question to ask among Zimbabweans is how did things come to this? Not so long ago we believed corruption was a culture of our Northern, Southern, Eastern and Western neighbours. Just about a decade ago, we used to proclaim utter shock at what we saw at the Zambia-Zimbabwe border post, the Botswana-Zimbabwe border post, the Mozambique-Zimbabwe border post and the South Africa-Zimbabwe post. Now these shocking people are utterly shocked with the new behaviour of the once super-righteous Zimbabweans. We now lead the pack. Scholars have come up with a number of causes for corruption, and it may be beneficial to have a quick look at some of these. One cause for corruption is opportunity and this is what one Bernadette M. Gawans described as ""just like the envelope of cash sitting in the parking lot"". These opportunities may arise from government-created monopolies, or from real or created crises in service provision. The second cause for corruption is little chance of getting caught, itself a result of lack of accountability, lack of transparency. This writer's experience in Zimbabwe's public service has a sad side where some public officials clearly felt that they were not obliged to explain what they were doing, including acquitting funds allocated to them for the benefit of the public. This writer is certain that the tradition has not at all changed even today. The most abused budget allocation in Government is the Travel and Subsistence Allowance. That money has done more in building privately owned houses than it has facilitated travel or subsistence for civil servants. Then there is this brazen doctrine of impunity. In 1994, a son of a prominent politician was arrested by Borrowdale police for a drug-related offence alongside other teenage colleagues. The police were apparently not aware who the young man was. The young man asked for a phone and he called to inform his father of what had happened. Another very senior politician pitched up at the police station and asked ""Mwana wangana ngana ari kupi?"", ""Where is so and so's son?"" The police asked who the son of ""so and so"" was and the very senior politician gave the name. The boy was brought out of the cells and the senior politician told the boy to sit and eat the food his aides had brought in. He then toured the police station with the bunch of police officers and on returning he simply said, ""Taenda isu vakomana"", ""Boys, we are out of here"", and off he went with the offender; without even asking what had happened. Instead of pursuing the matter, the police officers were blaming each other for not having asked the boy who he was born to. Such impunity of power holders is quite inherent in African politics. The third cause of corruption is bad incentives. Poor salaries such as the ones currently being received by Zimbabwean civil servants are a breeding ground for corruption. People working in an environment where they are meant to collect on behalf of Government an ocean of funds cannot be expected to make do with next to nothing as remuneration for their efforts. Even if they were not exposed to too much cash, opportunities to take advantage of others will always abound. This writer visited yet another deputy minister in July 2010 at his Harare office. The man made it very clear that only ""an absolute fool"" would not ""do something"" to add on to the ""meagre salaries"" paid to civil servants. He revealed his own salary that was well below US$500 and he questioned this writer, ""Reason, why do you think I left my job as a partner in a law firm to come and sit here all day for this little salary?"" I hope my good friend is not up to corrupt ways. But the point is that with such bad incentives corruption becomes inevitable, sad as it may sound. Fourthly, there is the question of attitude. People in general would resort to corruption and other illicit ways when a government law is considered to be a bad law or illegitimate. Lastly, there is the issue of survival. Sometimes a bribe may be considered as the only way out of a situation and many Zimbabwean drivers who paid licensing officers for their driving licences will bear testimony to this claim. Even pastors and priests have paid these kinds of bribes. Sometimes the issue of survival is as selfish as just wanting to get an unfair advantage over others, or simply to get things done quicker. The scourge of corruption is not exactly a problem attributable to one political party, as the propagandists against Zanu-PF will often claim. Zanu-PF is neither the creator nor the cause of corruption, guilty as the party may be for its own complicity, omissions and commissions in the whole matter. The matter comes down to the structure of the economy, the political culture in the country, the attitudes of our people, and of course the borrowed economic culture where we own banks without having the money to invest in them, building economic systems reliant upon the dictates of others from outside. We want to live big before we build an economic base. Progressive people do it the other way round. They build a strong economic base before they live large. It is us dominated people coming from colonial backgrounds who always want to do things backwards. Zimbabwe we are one and together we will overcome. It is homeland or death. Reason Wafawarova is a political write."119,The Herald (Harare),2/3/11,Why Corruption is Now Endemic [opinion],,ZIMBABWE (97%); AFRICA (94%); SOMALIA (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,14-Feb-11,,2274  words,CORRUPTION (92%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (89%); BRIBERY (89%); EXTORTION (75%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (75%); POLLS & SURVEYS (74%); ETHICS (72%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (72%); EMBEZZLEMENT (70%); RANKINGS (69%) Zimbabwe; Crime and Corruption,"A people who do not share history, who do not appreciate the shared experiences that their history and nationhood represents, are a people who cannot utilise mutual trust, dependability and a sense of unity of purpose; and this is the bane of Africa upon which lies the legendary failure to build sustainable, let alone successful economic social systems.

This is because capital projects are notorious for the opportunity they provide for bribes and kickbacks. One of the major setbacks resulting from corruption is lack of compliance with construction, environment or any other regulations that may be in place to ensure quality. As a result government services have largely become synonymous with poor quality. In Africa, there is this unpalatable tradition of externalisation of financial capital by political leaders and other looters to overseas destinations. Nigeria had US$400 billion stolen from treasury by the country's leaders between 1960 and 1999. That is quite phenomenal. Researchers from the University of Massachusetts found out that US$187 billion was externalised by Sub-Saharan African leaders between 1970 and 1996. This massive looting was, of course, from a handful of powerful elites. Politicians often steal more in times of political instability, or when their terms of office are due to expire. Another major cause for the externalisation of financial capital by politicians is the fear of expropriation of stolen assets by new governments. Africa has many stories of new governments confiscating assets stolen by ousted politicians. So the incumbent politicians find it prudent to stash away their loot in foreign countries where they believe the loot will be out of reach. Corruption has had drastic effects on humanitarian aid. This ranges from diversion of food aid, selling of food aid, exclusion of others, to soliciting for bribes, sexual and other forms of favours. The question to ask among Zimbabweans is how did things come to this? Not so long ago we believed corruption was a culture of our Northern, Southern, Eastern and Western neighbours. Just about a decade ago, we used to proclaim utter shock at what we saw at the Zambia-Zimbabwe border post, the Botswana-Zimbabwe border post, the Mozambique-Zimbabwe border post and the South Africa-Zimbabwe post. Now these shocking people are utterly shocked with the new behaviour of the once super-righteous Zimbabweans. We now lead the pack. Scholars have come up with a number of causes for corruption, and it may be beneficial to have a quick look at some of these. One cause for corruption is opportunity and this is what one Bernadette M. Gawans described as ""just like the envelope of cash sitting in the parking lot"". These opportunities may arise from government-created monopolies, or from real or created crises in service provision. The second cause for corruption is little chance of getting caught, itself a result of lack of accountability, lack of transparency. This writer's experience in Zimbabwe's public service has a sad side where some public officials clearly felt that they were not obliged to explain what they were doing, including acquitting funds allocated to them for the benefit of the public. This writer is certain that the tradition has not at all changed even today. The most abused budget allocation in Government is the Travel and Subsistence Allowance. That money has done more in building privately owned houses than it has facilitated travel or subsistence for civil servants. Then there is this brazen doctrine of impunity. In 1994, a son of a prominent politician was arrested by Borrowdale police for a drug-related offence alongside other teenage colleagues. The police were apparently not aware who the young man was. The young man asked for a phone and he called to inform his father of what had happened. Another very senior politician pitched up at the police station and asked ""Mwana wangana ngana ari kupi?"", ""Where is so and so's son?"" The police asked who the son of ""so and so"" was and the very senior politician gave the name. The boy was brought out of the cells and the senior politician told the boy to sit and eat the food his aides had brought in. He then toured the police station with the bunch of police officers and on returning he simply said, ""Taenda isu vakomana"", ""Boys, we are out of here"", and off he went with the offender; without even asking what had happened. Instead of pursuing the matter, the police officers were blaming each other for not having asked the boy who he was born to. Such impunity of power holders is quite inherent in African politics. The third cause of corruption is bad incentives. Poor salaries such as the ones currently being received by Zimbabwean civil servants are a breeding ground for corruption. People working in an environment where they are meant to collect on behalf of Government an ocean of funds cannot be expected to make do with next to nothing as remuneration for their efforts. Even if they were not exposed to too much cash, opportunities to take advantage of others will always abound. This writer visited yet another deputy minister in July 2010 at his Harare office. The man made it very clear that only ""an absolute fool"" would not ""do something"" to add on to the ""meagre salaries"" paid to civil servants. He revealed his own salary that was well below US$500 and he questioned this writer, ""Reason, why do you think I left my job as a partner in a law firm to come and sit here all day for this little salary?"" I hope my good friend is not up to corrupt ways. But the point is that with such bad incentives corruption becomes inevitable, sad as it may sound. Fourthly, there is the question of attitude. People in general would resort to corruption and other illicit ways when a government law is considered to be a bad law or illegitimate. Lastly, there is the issue of survival. Sometimes a bribe may be considered as the only way out of a situation and many Zimbabwean drivers who paid licensing officers for their driving licences will bear testimony to this claim. Even pastors and priests have paid these kinds of bribes. Sometimes the issue of survival is as selfish as just wanting to get an unfair advantage over others, or simply to get things done quicker. The scourge of corruption is not exactly a problem attributable to one political party, as the propagandists against Zanu-PF will often claim. Zanu-PF is neither the creator nor the cause of corruption, guilty as the party may be for its own complicity, omissions and commissions in the whole matter. The matter comes down to the structure of the economy, the political culture in the country, the attitudes of our people, and of course the borrowed economic culture where we own banks without having the money to invest in them, building economic systems reliant upon the dictates of others from outside. We want to live big before we build an economic base. Progressive people do it the other way round. They build a strong economic base before they live large. It is us dominated people coming from colonial backgrounds who always want to do things backwards. Zimbabwe we are one and together we will overcome. It is homeland or death.

An SLSA source informed Concord Times that Max Williams was involved in a container scam in which he allegedly charged a client more than the amount required for a container delivery by the shipping agency. Though Williams himself could not be reached for his comments, the source confirmed that Bollore, the French company that owns SLSA, has shown the general manager the exit door in a bid to protect the company's international reputation. It could be recalled that Bollore won the concessions to run and transform the Sierra Leone Ports Authority's container terminal for a 20-year period under a highly contested bidding process spearheaded by the National Commission for Privatization (NCP). Bollore is listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and it operates eight container terminal concessions in Africa. It offers stevedoring in 10 African ports and also operates in North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Oceania. Some observers within the Ports environment believe that Williams' sacking would attract very little sympathy from most SLSA customers who have had difficulties in dealing with him. ""We are definitely not going to miss him,"" remarked an SLSA client on condition of anonymity. Efforts at reaching the company's managing director, Rooy Chulin to comment on the issue also proved abortive."121,The New Times (Kigali),2/8/11,85 Corruption Cases to Be Heard in One Week,,RWANDA (93%),Newspaper,Edwin Musoni,ENGLISH,,,8-Feb-11,,337  words,CORRUPTION (98%); BRIBERY (90%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (78%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (78%); SUPREME COURTS (78%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (78%); TALKS & MEETINGS (73%); ARRESTS (73%) Rwanda; Crime and Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"The Spokesperson of Courts, Charles Kaliwabo, has announced that courts across the country will try 85 corruption-related cases in a period of one week, as a way of marking the anti-corruption week that started yesterday. The campaign is aimed at making the courtroom 'a corruption free square'. Addressing the press yesterday, Chief Justice, Aloysia Cyanzaire, said that the one week campaign will focus more on sensitization and town hall meetings to address corruption within the judiciary. ""The justice sector is very prone to corruption which is why we are drawing all measures possible to protect it. We also want to change the public perception of assuming that if someone loses a case, then the judge was corrupted,"" Cyanzaire said. ""We need to have all these corruption cases reported before the bribes are given out since it's hard to arrest corruption when it has already taken place."" Cyanzaire, who is also the head of the Superior Council of the Judiciary, added that in the last three years, five judicial officials have been charged with corruption while 15 people were arrested for attempting to bribe judges. Since 2008, the judiciary has so far tried 1,103 cases of corruption. In a related development, Cyanzayire refuted claims that the Rwandan judiciary is not independent saying that there is no case where a judge has been influenced to make a particular ruling. ""I have never instructed or requested any judge to pass a ruling contrary to his or her instincts; all the years I have been the Chief Justice of Rwanda, nobody has ever ordered me or requested me to pass a ruling contrary to the judge's decision,"" she said. The chief justice also gave the current status of the cases in courts saying that the courts handle over 50,000 cases annually, and that there are about 5,000 cases before the High Court. ""The Supreme Court handles over 1000 cases annually; the reason behind the big number of cases we are getting is because people have started developing trust in the judicial system,"" said Cyanzaire."122,The Namibian (Windhoek),2/11/11,Corruption in Namibia - Are We Losing the Fight?

This should sound familiar to the struggle generation. The colonialists and also a host of multi-national companies, especially in the mining and fishing sectors, were exploiting Namibia's resources with impunity and with little benefit accruing to the local population. That was the situation which the liberation movement was going to radically overhaul come independence. Reflecting on the situation after 20 years, it is clear that things have not changed much, at least for the majority. The Namibian regime did not only retain the 'political economy of theft' but added another dimension based on official corruption/looting - the GIPF saga for example. In an aptly titled article 'Namibia Pty Ltd' (The Namibian, July 21, 2006), Henning Melber wrote that 'decolonisation has been turned into private business'. He goes on to say that the transfer of political power was accompanied by the acceptance of the existing socio-economic structures. I fully concur with this analysis. I would also add that the problem in this country and elsewhere in Africa is that many of the elites in our countries lack that sense of nationalistic mindset and as a result have a very limited sense of ownership of their countries, thus seeing no need to develop them. They instead behave like 'political mercenaries' and thus see 'their' countries as cash cows for self-enrichment. For them anything that is not bolted to the floor is a good candidate for theft. In the case of Namibia the litany of either theft or corruption cases is now getting out of hand and the authority apparently has no interest to arrest the situation. After all some of those who are supposed to do so are either directly or indirectly, through their proxies, the beneficiaries in many of the corrupt schemes and deals to loot the country's resources. Some of these schemes take the form of facilitation fees, commissions or kick-backs sometimes running into millions, while others are simply theft. For example, how does one explain the N$100 million that was apparently 'invested' in Botswana which has disappeared without trace while the leaders are quiet and the masses are not questioning this? Then you have the 'loan' given to former President Laurent Kabila of the DRC amounting to approximately N$50 million, the N$30 million at the Social Security Commission, N$3 million to buy arms from a bogus arms dealer, 42 brand new laptops at the ECN gone without any trace, missing diamonds running into millions of dollars at a polishing factory in Okahandja; not to mention the thousands of dollars that usually go missing at our magistrates courts, government ministries, parastatals, including also Unam which is supposed to be a beacon of good governance? One doesn't want to be anecdotal about these issues but people urgently need answers about many of these cases. The more than N$660 million at the GIPF which we are made to understand has now been written off as a bad debt, but at the same there is apparently a forensic audit being carried out, which is yet another drain on tax-payers money as the external auditors have to be paid. And believe you me, this so-called investigation will not go beyond the 'report' stage. There are other aspects in the corruption network in this country. The Chinese, for example, didn't just choose to come to Namibia as their next destination; they were brought here by the Namibian regime for a purpose. They are always first in line to receive most of the multi-million government tenders and I can't imagine the kind of deals that are struck during some of these transactions. In the building industry they have now virtually replaced Namibians. And it doesn't end there; local corrupt officials are also selling communal land to the Chinese to rake in a quick buck. The same goes on in the fishing, tourism and the mining sectors where the elite are given quotas, licenses and EPLs which they then just sell to foreigners who end up controlling and thereby owning the country natural resources. Thus the field for all sorts of corrupt activities is quite open and is widening further. The problem is that there are simply too many bribe-takers in the country. So in this sea of corruption, I don't see how we are going to arrest this growing national endemic within the current political set-up with its weak political institutions, including the justice system and also lack of political will on the part of leadership despite all the talk especially from President Pohamba who when he became President said ""there will be zero tolerance for waste and corruption in public life."" The coming into being of the ACC in 2006 raised high expectations that past scandals and corruption would be investigated and resolved and the first steps taken in preventing future corruption. This was not to be as we now realise retrospectively. The ACC is yet to net any big fish in the country's corruption underworld network. So this is an uphill battle and would need the masses to become involved and to hold to account those who make them poor by diverting public money from the public good to private ends."123,The New Times (Kigali),2/14/11,Judges Cautioned Against Corruption,,RWANDA (92%),Newspaper,Alex Ngarambe,ENGLISH,,,14-Feb-11,,224  words,CORRUPTION (95%); JUDGES (91%); APPEALS COURTS (90%); BRIBERY (90%); ETHICS (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (74%); EXTORTION (73%) Rwanda; Crime and Corruption,"Judges and court employees, including clerks, were advised to resist any forms of corruption and maintain high levels of professionalism, if they are to maintain integrity in their work.

He urged those who are offered bribes to influence cases to always report the incidences as part of efforts to eliminate the vice. Hodari, encouraged the residents to get familiar with their rights , saying that some corrupt judges and lawyers take advantage of their ignorance to extort money. ""The government has put up the justice system to provide fair justice to the citizens and paying for this justice through corrupt officials contravenes this principle,"" he said. Anastase Bakuzakunde, the president of Musanze High Court, noted that there could be corrupt judges, in the courtrooms but they will soon be identified and kicked out. ""All the service providers in the justice sector should know the code of ethics in their profession and giving or receiving a bribe is intolerable,"" Bakuzakunde said.

Gabriel Nyenka has described the state of the young people of Liberia as being ""trapped"" in what he calls the ""quagmire of corruption"". Minister Nyenka said Liberia has been plagued by rampant corruption from the period of its foundation and has caused serious problems of integrity, having a smacking upshot on the country's youthful population. ""More young people today are trapped in the quagmire of corruption and lack of integrity...with many of them wanting to get rich too early...,"" the Deputy Internal Affairs Minister claimed Sunday when he served as guest speaker and induction officer at programs marking the installation of the Beh-Wein Youth Organization for Development and Productivity (BYODAP) in Bardnersville Estate. The District #8 representative aspirant said the issues of dishonest and lack of integrity among many young people was something panicky due to the fact that over 60 percent of Liberia's population constitutes youth. Mr. Nyenka said with Liberia at cross roads, it was time for the young people, who are future leaders, to change gear and build good characters of honesty and integrity to become responsible and polished people who can be trusted with leadership. Speaking on the topic ""Integrity in Service: A Challenge To young People In Today's Liberia,"" the former classroom teacher and principal (over 20 years experience) urged the BYODAP leadership to exhibit every virtue of integrity, honest and democratic leadership in the daily running of the organization. The Representative aspirant (he narrowly lost the seat in 2005) furthered challenged the young leaders to distance themselves from financial indecencies, lead by example and eschew all forms of dishonesties. Mr. Nyenka called on them to account for every penny they receive and ""must echo the trust and confidence of those who elected you,"" adding that whatever they do will live after them. As leaders, he encouraged them to copy the good leadership style of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf who has taken the bull by the horn to fight corruption which has eaten up the fabrics of the Liberian society for generations since its founding. Admonishing them not to strive to get ""rich"" before their time, Nyenka, also a Minister of the Gospel, told the young leaders that ""integrity is the hallmark to Liberia's development drive,"" and they should practice it. He then used the occasion to advise the youth of Liberia, and District #8 in particular, to be careful with the plethora of aspirants ahead of this year's general and presidential elections. Some of the aspirants, he said, lack every glimmer of integrity and must not be given the chance to represent them. He urged them to watch carefully, scrutinize them scrupulously before making decision to vote for them. ""Too many of us aspirants have come with big mouths and promises...but we lack the integrity to lead. Some of us are trapped in allegations and this makes us disqualified to represent the people,"" Mr. Nyenka indicated, adding, ""You can have all the degrees but if you lack integrity, the future is bleak."" Installing the officers, Mr. Nyenka reminded them that they were elected to be servants. ""You are servants, not masters and you must serve with diligence."" Those inducted included John V. Farmah, President; John P. Darway, Vice President; Miss Klajue Toe, General Secretary and Mr. S. Bobby Wehee, Financial Secretary. In his inaugural address, the BYODAP President said he would fulfill campaign promises to the fullest come what may. Mr. Farmah described his ascendancy to BYODAP Presidency as a significant turning point in the history of the Beh-Wein, a community in the township of Bardnersville, just on the fringes of the E. Jonathan Goodridge Housing Estate. Among other things, Mr. Farmah said his leadership will promote, undertake and enhance reconciliation, community driven development initiatives, youth empowerment through short-term employment programs, opening of a bank account in the community's name, academic challenge programs and social programs for the youth to showcase their talents. ""Today, I stand here to assure that my government will fulfill all of those promises,"" Farmah stated authoritatively. Meanwhile, Mr. Nyenka has awarded the youth organization five scholarships (at all levels) and promised to provide the first truck load of sand for one of the organizations development project as an initial contribution. Another representative aspirant of the district, Madam Korto Jallah-Socree promised computer education of 15 youth (10 females and five males)."125,Concord Times (Freetown),2/21/11,MP Accuses MDAs of Corruption,,SIERRA LEONE (92%),Newspaper,Regina Pratt,ENGLISH,,,22-Feb-11,,307  words,CORRUPTION (91%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (78%); INTERVIEWS (78%); INDICTMENTS (76%); MISAPPROPRIATION (54%) Sierra Leone; Governance; Crime and Corruption,"All People's Congress member of parliament representing Constituency 111 in the Western Urban has accused certain ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) of fiddling government resources for their own benefits, noting that it is only now that such negative developments are coming to the fore. Speaking in an exclusive interview with Concord Times at parliament building on the recent indictment of corrupt government officials, Hon. Charles Kalawa said ""nobody knows the depth of corruption in this country"" as there were so many things still hidden. According to the MP, the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) came at the right time and that public officials should be aware about the price they will pay for misappropriating public funds that are meant for the development of the society. He commended the ACC for doing what he referred to as ""a very good job"" in going after corrupt state officials; a feat he said has never been achieved in the past. ""The ACC is doing a good job in exposing corruption in the society,"" Hon. Kalawa stated and urged the commissioner and his team to continue with their campaign in riding the Sierra Leonean society of corrupt moguls. ""The ACC needs to be protected in order for them to do their work effectively without fear or favour,"" he stressed. Giving his opinion on the rate of corruption in the country, Hon. Robin Faley of the SLPP and of Constituency 7 in the Kailahun district said he was not wholly convinced as to how the ACC was prosecuting corruption cases. He however commended the commission for the stance it has taken in exposing corrupt acts in MDAs, and encouraged the anti-graft agency to be objective, sincere and fair in the discharge of its duties. He assured the ACC of parliament's support ""so that collectively we can minimize corruption and push the socio-economic agenda forward""."126,The Namibian (Windhoek),3/4/11,"On Corruption, Betrayal And Disillusionment [column]",,NAMIBIA (92%),Newspaper,Alexactus T Kaure,ENGLISH,,,10-Mar-11,,852  words,CORRUPTION (91%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); AUDITS (89%); PUBLIC FINANCE (78%); ETHICS (77%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (77%); EMBEZZLEMENT (77%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (77%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (77%); ACCOUNTING (72%); TALKS & MEETINGS (71%); FORENSICS (64%) Namibia; Crime and Corruption,"The GIPF tale has now clearly brought to the fore what some of us have been saying over the years: the Pohamba administration has no intention to fight corruption. By strictly keeping the BDO audit report close to his chest, Pohamba is now truly following in the footsteps of his predecessor - former President Sam Nujoma who would set up commissions of enquiries and then simply hold onto the reports as secret documents. The purpose was simply to placate the people - and to create an impression that something was being done to combat corruption. When he came to power, Pohamba promised the nation that the Nujoma commissions of inquiry reports would be laid bare for public scrutiny. He also said ""there will be zero tolerance for waste and corruption in public life."" And when opening the first Cabinet meeting for 2011, he was upbeat, saying the snake of corruption must be hit hard on the head. He further encouraged citizens 'to adopt an ethical attitude and expose all forms of corruption, embezzlement of public funds and abuse or wastage of public resources'. All the promises and lofty words have now come to nothing. Pohamba didn't live up to what he promised the nation after becoming President, nor is he going to act on both the Namfisa and the BDO reports. In fact he simply ignored the recommendations contained in the 2007 Namfisa Report which, inter alia, suggested that the GIPF Trustees and even some of the managers be replaced. Nor were the trustees and the top management sent on 'special' leave or suspended while the forensic audit was being conducted as they do with other entities - Namcor for example. We understand that only some snippets are being made available from the latest report on the GIPF, and then only to a select number of people. So what are we to make of all this? This is not 'intelligence' information. These are investigations into public money which was inadvisedly or corruptly dished out to a few individuals, some of whom then went on shopping sprees to buy themselves cars, houses and farms, and later to simply declare their 'brief-case companies' bankrupt. And how immoral and greedy our people can be, because some of the very people who squandered those millions again lined up for another round of cash from their favourite cash-cow - the GIPF. Thanks to Cabinet, this time it woke up from its deep slumber and stopped the madness. And the incompetent board of trustee and management in an act that was disingenuous, to say the least, decided to conduct an own probe into the mess it created. But we now have two highly critical audit and independent reports, one by Namfisa and the latest by BDO Chartered Accountants. It is now for the Namibian regime and the judicial system to hold those involved in all those scams criminally responsible. But I can assure you that nothing will come out of this 'white-wash exercise' for a number of reasons. First and foremost is that we have now what appears to be a lame-duck President - basically a lot of talk and promises and no action. Pohamba is not a known anti-corruption crusader. Second, there are simply too many corrupt souls all the way through the political hierarchy involved in the whole GIPF saga. So, it is not the regime fighting corrupt individuals in the country but rather the people trying to fight a corrupt and an easily corruptible regime. Thirdly, the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has been totally sidelined and is basically beginning to lose its relevance. The ACC, in my view, is obstructed, deliberately, by the very people at the heart and at the top of the government who appointed it because of lack of political will. Even our judicial system which is supposed to be prosecuting the corrupt in our society would rather fight the ACC. One other reason why most of these corrupt cases go cold is because there aren't sufficiently trained or experienced people in commercial/financial crimes at the Prosecutor-General's Office and in the judicial system. Are we losing the fight against corruption then? I posed that question last month in my column. My response was somewhat mooted but at least I had faith in ordinary people and their growing anger about their rulers' abuse of the trust they were given and I was hoping that they would start to demand some answers from them. But as it turned out at a recent civil service demonstration, the Namibian regime is not prepared to listen to its own people. Even the petition letter was completely ignored by the political leadership. Personally I doubt whether we would be able to go beyond the 'report' stage of this latest investigation. Already the people are being prepared for that because the regime is now saying this process is going to take a long time. Minister Joel Kaapanda is now coming up with all sorts of lame excuses saying they can't release the names of those implicated in the report and that the process is going to drag on for a long period of time. Thus ordinary people are now losing hope in their 'government' commitment to fighting corruption. It is thus a story of betrayal and disillusionment for many of them."127,Concord Times (Freetown),3/8/11,ACC Takes Corruption Crusade to Kenema Schools,,SIERRA LEONE (93%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,9-Mar-11,,524  words,CORRUPTION (97%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (90%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (90%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (89%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (89%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (89%); SCHOOL TRUANCY (78%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (78%); BEST PRACTICES (72%); SECONDARY SCHOOLS (61%) Sierra Leone; Education; Crime and Corruption,"The eastern regional office of the Anti-Corruption Commission has taken the crusade against corruption to schools in Kenema. The campaign which is the first to be mounted in Kenema was meant to explain to both pupils and teachers the operations of the ACC the bad effects of corruption, the benefits the nation stands to enjoy if all join the commission to fight against corruption. It was also meant to promote the virtues of integrity and patriotism in the pupils and make them into a formidable anti-corruption force. Addressing pupils in the various schools, the leader of the team, Mr. Peter Baio Kamara said people usually judge the commission by the number of high profile arrests, prosecutions and convictions. He said the ACC has the education and prevention departments. The education department carries out public education in institutions and communities on the bad effects of corruption and the good things a corrupt free country stands to gain. He said that the Systems and Process Review department looks into existing systems, practices and procedures in government ministries departments and agencies, identifies, corruption prone areas and makes recommendations on best practice. He highlighted several successes of the ACC and emphasized that much could be achieved with the help of all present. Public Education Officer of ACC Eastern Region, David Kanehkey Conteh catalogued late coming, truancy, cheating, exams malpractices, shabby dressing and violence as marks of low integrity. He said if pupils grow up with these vices they will surely do the same when they start work as public officers. He therefore encouraged pupils to desist from such practices and imbibe the culture of integrity, which will make them good citizens in society. Mr. Conteh further identified practices going on in schools that the commission frowns at such as illegal charges, dodging of classes by teachers, forcing pupils to buy pamphlets, extra classes at the expense of the normal classes to name a few. He warned teachers and school authorities to refrain from acts that will invite the ""unfriendly face"" of the commission, stressing that the ACC is more interested in making more converts than convicts. District Coordinating Officer Kenema district, Mohamed Sylvanus Blake said that the commission is only providing leadership in the fight against corruption and that it is the responsibility of every Sierra Leonean including the pupils and teachers to support it in its fight to eradicate corruption in Sierra Leone. Mr. Blake explained the procedure for reporting corruption and encouraged both pupils and teachers to report corruption not only as their support to the commission but also as a demonstration of their love for the country. He gave out the hot lines through which they can report corruption and left them with the slogan ""what is not for you don't take it"". A question and answer session formed part of the programme. The following schools were visited: Holy Rosary Secondary School (JSS &SSS); Holy Trinity Secondary School (JSS &SSS); Islamic Secondary School (JSS &SSS); and the Kenema Government Secondary School (JSS &SSS)."128,The New Times (Kigali),3/10/11,Regional Blocs Intensify Fight Against Corruption,,RWANDA (94%),Newspaper,Eric Kabeera,ENGLISH,,,10-Mar-11,"KIGALI, RWANDA (92%)",298  words,CORRUPTION (93%); NONTARIFF BARRIERS (92%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (92%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%); BRIBERY (77%); COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS (72%); ECONOMIC POLICY (71%); ECONOMIC NEWS (71%); INTERVIEWS (69%) Rwanda; Crime and Corruption,"As the three regional blocs (COMESA, EAC and SADC) continue to integrate their economies, countries have been advised to emulate Rwanda's mechanism of fighting corruption.

The NTBs mentioned include corruption, unnecessary roadblocks, weighbridges and lack of mutual recognition of quality standards, as these have become impediments in regional economy. Member states of the EAC have, for the past few years, embarked on reducing these barriers to trade. She added that online mechanism had been established to enable stakeholders to report and monitor non-tariff barriers encountered in SADC, COMESA and EAC as way of eradicating them in the region. ""If, for example, a driver transporting cargo is stopped at the border and is asked for a bribe, he has authority to submit complaint through email to the tripartite secretariat,"" she said. Meanwhile, Peace Basemera, a trade negotiator in the Ministry of Trade and Commerce commended the online mechanism, saying that it will tackle corruption and enhance economic cooperation. ""We have been meeting regularly to discuss traders' problems and this online mechanism will help to reduce NTBs,"" she said The Tripartite comprises 26 member countries from the three regional blocs."129,The New Times (Kigali),3/11/11,Fighting Corruption Will Foster Regional Economic Intergration [editorial],,RWANDA (93%); AFRICA (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,11-Mar-11,"KIGALI, RWANDA (79%)",219  words,CORRUPTION (96%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (92%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (90%); BRIBERY (78%); NONTARIFF BARRIERS (78%); EMERGING MARKETS (77%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (77%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (77%); TALKS & MEETINGS (73%); TAXES & TAXATION (73%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (72%); ECONOMIC NEWS (68%); RULE OF LAW (68%) Rwanda; Crime and Corruption,"This week, countries in the region were advised by trade experts to emulate Rwanda's strategies of fighting corruption, as three regional blocs (Comesa, EAC, and SADC) continue to integrate their economies. Comesa members pointed out, during the two-day meeting, in Kigali, to examine how to eradicate Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs) in the region, that if the war against corruption is not fought collectively, the region would fail to attain economic prosperity. For the region to succeed at all fronts better mechanisms to fight corruption must be adopted and there must be a strong will on the part of the governments. The vice should concern the entire region. A corrupt free-environment will not only foster trade, but will improve the welfare of the citizens. Findings from World Bank reveal that corruption is evidently Africa's greatest threat to economic development, as well as human survival. Indeed, like the trade experts noted, regional economic integration cannot be fully realized if some partners continue to render lip services. Corruption undermines the rule of law and weakens the institutional foundations upon which economic growth depends. Bribery, nepotism and other forms of corruption exist in the region and this, if not eliminated, remains the greatest obstacles to economic and social development."130,The Namibian (Windhoek),3/18/11,Corruption Laws Challenged [analysis],,NAMIBIA (94%); CHINA (79%),Newspaper,Werner Menges,ENGLISH,,,18-Mar-11,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (73%)",1109  words,CORRUPTION (94%); LAWYERS (90%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (90%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (89%); CONSTITUTIONAL LAW (78%); INDICTMENTS (78%); CRIME PREVENTION (78%); BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (76%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (76%); APPOINTMENTS (76%); ENERGY & UTILITY LAW (71%); COMPANY STRUCTURES & OWNERSHIP (70%); COMPUTER SCANNERS (63%) Namibia; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Crime and Corruption,"Two of the main weapons in Namibia's arsenal for the fight against corruption and organised crime are set to face a constitutional attack in the High Court. Key parts of the Anti-Corruption Act of 2003 and the Prevention of Organised Crime Act of 2004 are unconstitutional, corruption and fraud suspects Teckla Lameck and Kongo Mokaxwa are arguing in a case that was filed with the High Court yesterday. Public Service Commission member Lameck and Mokaxwa, who is a business partner of Lameck, are asking the court to declare parts of the two laws, which provide the backbone of eight of the 18 charges they and a co-accused, Chinese national Yang Fan, are facing in the High Court in the city of Windhoek, as unconstitutional. They are also questioning the legality of the appointment of senior Cabinet member Pendukeni Iivula-Ithana as both Minister of Justice and Attorney-General in 2005. Lameck and Mokaxwa are asking the court to declare that Iivula-Ithana's appointment as Justice Minister and as Attorney-General was against the Constitution. If they succeed in getting such a declaration from the court, the operation of the entire Prevention of Organised Crime Act is in danger, as it was Iivula-Ithana who, in her capacity as Justice Minister, announced in the Government Gazette in April 2009 that the Act was coming into operation from May 5 2009. Defence lawyer Sisa Namandje, who is representing Lameck and Mokaxwa, informed Judge President Petrus Damaseb of the constitutional challenge that his clients have launched when they and Yang made another pre-trial appearance in the High Court in Windhoek yesterday. Lameck, Mokaxwa and Yang are facing charges over an alleged corrupt deal in which Chinese-made security scanning equipment was bought by the Ministry of Finance in 2008. They are charged in an indictment containing 18 counts. Lameck is facing all of the charges, while Mokaxwa is charged with 12 counts and Yang is charged with six. The charges against all three include a count of fraud, in which they are accused of having defrauded Government between October 1 2006 and March 17 2009 when the Ministry of Finance bought security scanning equipment from a Chinese company, Nuctech, at a price of US$55,3 million (then about N$477 million). It is alleged that the price of the equipment was inflated to enable Nuctech, which was being represented by Yang, to pay a ""commission"" of at least US$12,828 million to Teko Trading, a close corporation of Lameck and Mokaxwa. This ""commission"", of which about N$42 million was paid, allegedly was to be shared between Lameck, Mokaxwa and Yang. Lameck and Mokaxwa alone are also accused of having defrauded a Swapo-owned company, Namib Contract Haulage, between December 16 2006 and June 10 2009 by getting the company to pay inflated prices for trucks that it was buying in China. Lameck was a director of Namib Contract Haulage, while Mokaxwa was an employee of the company. Lameck alone is facing six charges under the Anti-Corruption Act, based on allegations that while being a Public Service Commissioner she was engaged in other paid work - primarily the activities of Teko Trading CC and its alleged corrupt involvement in the Chinese X-ray scanner deal - without the permission of President Hifikepunye Pohamba. Lameck, Mokaxwa and Yang are also jointly charged with two counts under the Prevention of Organised Crime Act. The three suspects have pleaded not guilty to all charges that they faced when their case was still before the Windhoek Magistrate's Court. In the constitutional challenge filed yesterday it is being argued that Iivula-Ithana was not lawfully appointed as Justice Minister and Attorney-General in 2005. This, Lameck is arguing in an affidavit, is because the Constitution does not allow the Attorney General to also be a member of the Cabinet. ""Clearly the Constitution demands an independent legal functionary, who may not, by the very wording of the Constitution, be a member of Cabinet, and bound by the principles of Cabinet allegiance and responsibility,"" Lameck argues. She claims that because Iivula-Ithana's dual appointment as Justice Minister and Attorney-General was unlawful, her determination of the date that the Prevention of Organised Crime Act came into operation was also unlawful, with the result that the Act never started operating. The Anti-Corruption Act's definition of the term ""corruptly"" is being attacked as unreasonable, vague and too wide. The Act defines ""corruptly"" as meaning ""in contravention of or against the spirit of any law, provision, rule, procedure, process, system, policy, practice, directive, order or any other term or condition pertaining to any employment relationship; any agreement; or the performance of any function in whatever capacity"". States Lameck on this score: ""(M)any thousands of laws, provisions, rules, procedures, processes, systems, policies, practices, directives and orders are to be found in Namibia. (. . .) These rules may be found in every conceivable printed document, whether stored in a drawer, on the top of a cupboard, or even in the national archives. They may not even be in writing. But when the Anti-Corruption Act became of full force and effect, it is not only the contravention of these rules which may constitute a crime. Also a perceived transgression of the relevant 'spirit' of those rules may constitute a crime."" The main thrust of the challenge to the constitutionality of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act is directed at that law's provision that it also covers ""unlawful activities"" that took place before the Act came into operation. Such a provision that makes the Act operate retrospectively ""is patently unconstitutional"", Lameck claims. She argues: ""(T)he retrospective effect of the definitions 'unlawful activity' and 'proceeds of unlawful activities' has the potential of criminalising activity, which was not an offence at the time it was committed, and make property which was previously legally obtained (. . .) subject to confiscation."" All of the acts over which they are charged in connection with the Chinese scanner deal took place before the Prevention of Organised Crime Act came into operation, Lameck points out. The case filed yesterday appears set to keep the criminal case against Lameck and her co-accused pending until the constitutional matter has been dealt with. Lameck, Mokaxwa and Yang now have to attend another pre-trial hearing in the High Court on April 7. Lameck and Mokaxwa are remaining free on bail of N$50 000 each. Yang is free on bail of N$1 million. He spent a year and four months in custody before his bail was paid in November last year."131,New Democrat (Monrovia),3/19/11,Senate Fears Dumping Morlu is Lost War On Corruption,,LIBERIA (92%),Newspaper,Boimah J.

""If Morlu is replaced, it would have to disrupt the fight against corruption,"" a UP Senator who preferred to be anonymous told this paper Thursday. There has been a public frenzy over speculations that Mr. Morlu, regarded as one of the prime champions for transparency who has transformed the GAC from a moribund institution to an internationally respected one, will be shown the door once his contract ends sometime next month. These speculations are rife despite the President's acknowledgement, in her State of the Nation Address, that the AG has been unwavering and committed in the fight for transparency. But Presidential Press Secretary Cyrus Badio told journalist last week that media speculations on the alleged pitfalls of sacking Mr. Morlu will not help the AG because, he added, the President will not bow to pressure. Speculations are that the President is determined to get a new Auditor General that she is comfortable with, although there is no confirmation of this. However, speaking to this paper at a press conference Thursday, Sen. Blamo Nelson [of the Alliance For Peace and Democracy (APD) Grand Kru County], said although it is not an easy decision to make, the President's impending decision on Morlu could either continue the fight against corruption or stop it. Senator Nelson: ""Other leaders reached a similar point in the past, and we saw how their stance against corruption was defeated when they chose a path that they think was good. Re-nominating Morlu would mean well for all of us. ""Morlu has done a very good job. Personally, I would regret if he were not retained by the President. Therefore, this administration should not back away like others. We should remain on course. There was no Chart of Account. Today we have a chart. This fight against abuse and corruption should definitely be retained."" Mr. Morlu has been at odds with several government officials listed in his audits for their failure to account for hundreds of thousands of dollars meant for government projects and programs. On the other hand, his work has been endorsed by several donors, including the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Mr. Bruce Wharton, who recently observed that: ""Liberia's Auditor General has aggressively and thoroughly tracked government revenue from practically every ministry, but the government follow-up has been very disappointing. Some crucial bills affecting key resources such as timber and maritime revenue have been passed without adequate attention to key details. Furthermore, the government must begin addressing a wide variety of issues affecting national reconciliation."""132,New Democrat (Monrovia),3/19/11,"Prince Johnson Vows Executions for Rape, Corruption, As President",,NIGERIA (94%); LIBERIA (93%),Newspaper,Boimah J.

Speaking at his party's headquarters in Sinkor on Monday upon his return from Nigeria, where he said he met with Former Nigerian President Obasanjo, he admitted executing people, but justified his actions by saying the executed people had no right to rape. ""During the war we instituted guidelines, special operational procedures to govern our combatants. And we said no raping. Rape is a capital crime. If you rape, execution. It's not good to execute, but it's not also good to rape somebody's child,"" he said. ""We will fight corruption to the letter. We will make it impossible for you to steal people's money. You may say Sen. Johnson is just talking because he hasn't got the post. The former warlord turned lawmaker told his partisans that if he did all that when he was a warlord in a state of ""anarchy,"" what should one expect when he becomes president in his endeavor to fight ""societal ills""? ""So if we had this guide lines during the war to protect women and girls against rape, during the war when lives were cheap, when your life depended on the gun-toting men, and we instituted these rules to govern the activities of combats, protecting lives and properties in conflict in a state of anarchy, what do you think when we are there(elected President) what will happen?"" he asked. Dressed in a cream-like coat and a gray pair of trousers, Sen. Johnson declared himself 'fit' for the elections and promised more reforms in several sectors, including health and education, where he said the largest budget amounts would be allotted if he is elected president. Senator Johnson (Nimba), former leader of the erstwhile rebel group, the Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia, a breakaway faction of Mr. Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia, is listed in the Truth and Reconciliation Report as ""the most notorious"" and recommended, amongst several others, for prosecution for war crimes."133,The New Times (Kigali),3/24/11,Karugarama Shares Nation's Strategy to Fight Corruption,,RWANDA (94%); LESOTHO (94%),Newspaper,Edmund Kagire,ENGLISH,,,24-Mar-11,"MASERU, LESOTHO (93%)",446  words,CORRUPTION (95%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (90%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS (77%); TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER (77%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (73%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (70%); INVESTIGATIONS (65%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (57%) Rwanda; Crime and Corruption,"The Minister of Justice, Tharcisse Karugarama, yesterday, delivered a keynote address at an anti- corruption conference in Maseru, Lesotho, organized by the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho, the Commonwealth Business Council and the Business Action against Corruption. The theme of the conference was ""Business Action against Poverty: Public-Private Strategies to Improve Governance"" Karugarama, who represented President Paul Kagame spoke about Rwanda's policy of zero tolerance on corruption and how the vice has been reduced massively. He noted that fighting corruption in Rwanda started in a conventional way, but has since gone on to include the support of the private sector, helping the government to tackle the problem at five levels. ""First, was the political level which formed the basis for subsequent actions. There had to be strong political will among leaders in order to influence policy and implementation of strategies,"" Karugarama said. ""Second, at the level of prevention and enforcement, we enacted laws and set up institutions and systems of transparency, accountability and monitoring. Such institutions as the Rwanda Revenue Authority and the Rwanda National Examinations Council ensure transparency,"" he added. The minister also cited other institutions like the Office of the Ombudsman and the Auditor General which promote and monitor accountability and prevent abuse of office and resources. He said that the creation of special units like the Police, Judiciary and National Public Prosecution Authority to investigate, prosecute and adjudicate corruption cases, have been crucial in fighting the vice. Karugarama said that the government instituted monitoring mechanisms at the technical level, taking advantage of available technology. ""The Government of Rwanda made doing business in the country easier by simplifying and reducing licensing and registration procedures, mainly through increased use of ICT,"" Karugarama said. ""This has removed the need for business people wanting to set up business in Rwanda, to cut corners, and has eliminated corrupt officials who would take advantage of lengthy and complex procedures,"" added the Justice Minister. He noted that the zero-tolerance stance on corruption is accompanied by prosecution of offenders, whether they are from the public or private sector, while the recovery of stolen assets is also ensured, making corruption is a ""very risky venture"". The Minister emphasised that corruption is very costly to both governments and businesses and, as such, negatively affects development efforts. The main objective of the conference is to assess the impact of public-private partnerships in fighting corruption."134,New Democrat (Monrovia),3/28/11,"""Corruption is Old...""",,LIBERIA (95%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (90%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,29-Mar-11,,329  words,GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (90%); CORRUPTION (89%); AUDITS (89%); AGREEMENTS (76%); EUROPEAN UNION (74%); WAGES & SALARIES (68%); SUITS & CLAIMS (65%) Liberia; Crime and Corruption,"President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, under pressure to halt the continuing spread of corruption, says it is almost as the country.

The President did not elaborate on what she meant, but she recently said she had underestimated the strength of corruption from the onset, despite her extending experience in government and international service dating from the 1970s.

She said she will ask for continued financial and technical support of the European Union to the General Auditing Commission. This, she said, will enable her government to act even more effectively in fighting corruption and in pursuing appropriate legal action against those charged with financial malpractice in the 40-plus audit reports that have been concluded.

The parastatal blacklists, for up to three years,  companies found to have deliberately failed to deliver on their  contractual obligations or flouted the tendering process. Previously, there have been reports of some public officials colluding with contractors to embezzle public funds. However, in most cases, it is the officials who get punished with contractors walking scot-free. In such circumstances, both parties are culpable and deserve to be held accountable, whether through criminal or administrative course of action. With RPPA now boldly taking administrative measures against offending contractors as well, including naming and shaming, the blacklisted companies will think twice before committing the same offences again. The measures will also serve as an example to other companies that may consider doing shoddy work or flouting the tendering process. In fact, once the suspension is lifted, past offenders may end up playing a crucial role in the fight against corruption by exposing officials attempting to extort a bribe from them in exchange for a public tender.

Mr. Kamara was speaking during a general meeting and formal launch of the Network of National Anti Corruption Institutions in West Africa (NACIWA), where he left participants with no option but to describe Sierra Leone's anti-corruption laws as the strongest not only in West Africa but the continent as a whole. The virtue in Sierra Leone's anti-corruption laws were exhibited when four countries including Mali, Benin, Nigeria and Sierra Leone represented by deputy commissioner Morlai Buya Kamara, were carefully selected to showcase best practice in fighting corruption. Though all of them spoke on investigation and partnership with the media, some spoke on prosecutorial powers: but quite distinctly, Kamara spoke on some traits of the Sierra Leone Anti-Corruption Commission which distinguishes its strength, role and efficacy - to an extent that it got an acknowledgement of its laws being the strongest in Africa. According to Kamara, partnerships with the media and civil society, coupled with a very strong political will demonstrated by the government and its leadership, have immensely contributed to the success of the Sierra Leone Anti-Corruption Commission.

From it, the verdict of the US State Department is harsher than its verdict in 2009. In its previous report--2009--the US State Department ruled that corruption prevailed at ""all levels"" of the Government. This meant that there were no exceptions, no saints, all condemned. In its current report, its verdict is extreme. Corruption, it said, has been ""exacerbated,"" and that it prevails, triumphantly, within the entire government with impunity. Excerpts from the report: ""The law does not provide criminal penalties for corruption, which remained systemic throughout the government, although criminal penalties do exist for economic sabotage, mismanagement of funds and other corruption-related acts. Official corruption and the sense of a culture of impunity were exacerbated by low pay levels for the civil service, lack of job training, and a lack of court convictions. The government dismissed officials for alleged corruption and recommended others for prosecution. ""The Liberian Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC) and the Ministry of Justice are responsible for exposing and combating official corruption. The LACC is empowered to prosecute any case that the Ministry of Justice declines to prosecute; however, the Ministry had not declined to prosecute any such cases during the year."" The disturbing conclusion, that the ""law does not provide criminal penalties for corruption,"" is disturbing. If so, then we can now begin to grasp the gravity of the plague that permeates the society at all levels. Because there is no law against those who plunder state resources, talks of fighting the disease is useless. An illness that has no medicine cannot be cured, and those afflicted by it must die. Thus corruption is like AIDS in Liberia. There are no laws against it. It is free for all, a factor that explains the stampede for public office since, once within, nothing can be done to stop one from stealing. It is said that there is an entrenched culture of impunity, meaning fear for theft of public funds is unnecessary since there are only rewards and no punishment. The US conclusion also explains why, despite all the anticorruption public relations, not a single official has been convicted or punished. Those dismissed, in some cases, have been recycled. If Africa's oldest independent republic lacks laws against corruption, the single most powerful factor responsible for the country's immensely shameful underdevelopment, then the national decay that have resulted in wars and anarchies can be easily understood. It is unlikely that the status quo, under the command of individuals benefiting from the virus, particularly within the Legislature responsible for making laws, will change anytime soon. That this legislature is incapable of passing laws to make corruption a criminal offense is unlikely because, according to the US Report, it refused to forward for prosecution several of those that the General Auditing Commission discovered have stolen huge sums of money from the state. We believe that the Government should embrace this report, instead of challenging its findings as it has done with similar reports in the past. Living in denial is a dangerous option. Accepting truth can lead to honest attempt in finding solutions. The first attempt, we believe, is passing laws to make corruption a criminal offense with stiff penalties, including outright confiscation of property. But we are not delusional. This is a challenge that the current legislature maybe unable, unwilling and unready to take up."143,The Namibian (Windhoek),4/15/11,"Big Money for Improved Civil Service, Corruption Fight",,NAMIBIA (93%),Newspaper,Catherine Sasman,ENGLISH,,,21-Apr-11,,430  words,"LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); BUILDING RENOVATION (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); BUDGETS (90%); PRIME MINISTERS (90%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (90%); CORRUPTION (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (88%); CIVIL SERVICES (79%); APPROVALS (78%); RISK MANAGEMENT (76%); DISASTER RELIEF (74%); ENERGY & UTILITY LAW (71%) Namibia; Crime and Corruption; Economy, Business and Finance","Government plans to fork out a whopping N$154 million for the improvement of the public service cadre. Motivating for the approval of the budget of the Office of the Prime Minister in Parliament yesterday, Nahas Angula, said the amount would go towards the recently launched Namibia Institute of Public Administration (NIPAM) and the performance management system. The public service management and improvement functions are performed by the Public Service Commission. The second largest allocation in the Prime Minister's office, N$40 million goes towards the construction of the NIPAM building, the renovation of the old State House, the construction or renovations of various offices or warehouses of the Disaster and Risk Management Department. The National Emergency and Disaster Fund receives an annual allocation of N$20 million. Angula said a bill to establish a statutory body responsible for disaster reduction and management would be tabled before Parliament in due course. For Cabinet and parliamentary functions, an allocation of N$37 million was made. Approximately N$7.5 million was allotted for special programmes under the Prime Minister's office. These are N$3,9 million for the San social inclusion programme; N$862 000 for the disability advocacy unit; N$700 000 for the development of the economic empowerment framework; N$1 818 000 for the public office bearers remuneration commission; and N$200 000 for the National Alliance for the Improvement Nutrition unit. Angula also motivated for a massive increase in the budget of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) of N$62 540 000, up from N$36 786 000 of the previous financial year. This is for the two main programmes of the ACC, which are the investigation of corruption (N$37 million) and N$25 million to put in place anti-corruption measures. Angula said the ACC needs Government's support to effectively fight the scourge of corruption, arguing that adequate funding is needed to place the ACC in a position to do so. During the last financial year the ACC investigated 294 reports of alleged corruption. The ACC referred 56 cases to the Prosecutor General with a recommendation for prosecution, while numerous others were referred to other relevant authorities. Angula said in virtually all instances, the matters were only referred after preliminary inquiries were conducted. He reported a reduction in the number of non-mandate related complaints, and attributed it to actions taken against offenders and public educational campaigns. The ACC has recruited 10 additional staff members during the last financial year."144,New Democrat (Monrovia),4/15/11,Freeman's Anti-Corruption March Allowed,,LIBERIA (94%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,15-Apr-11,,349  words,CORRUPTION (90%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (79%); POLICE FORCES (79%); PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (78%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (78%); JOURNALISM (77%); LAWYERS (75%); VEHICLE TRAFFIC (71%); PRESS CONFERENCES (71%); WRITERS (71%); VANDALISM (68%) Liberia; Crime and Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Officials at the Justice ministry says presidential aspirant Freeman Simeon of the opposition Movement of Progressive Change (MPC) is at liberty ""to go and get his permit"" requested for his planned nationwide demonstration against corruption.

In reply to a journalist's question during a regular information ministry press briefing Thursday, Solicitor General M. Wilkins Wright said: ""Yes, Mr. Freeman will be granted a permit to demonstrate as he has requested to demonstrate throughout the 15 counties, especially the principal cities of the counties."" He said, ""Mr. Simeon Freeman is free to mobilize, as many (people) as he wants (in order) to carry out the demonstration"". But Cllr.

""The law does not provide criminal penalties for corruption, which remained systemic throughout the government, although criminal penalties do exist for economic sabotage, mismanagement of funds and other corruption-related acts,"" Section Four of the report titled 'Official Corruption and Government Transparency', stated. The US Government report released this month was last week corroborated by the Liberian Government when the Ministry of Justice, in its report on corruption, declared that corruption was prevalent at all levels of society including the public and private sectors. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf who promised to make corruption public enemy number one in her administration in her 6th State of the Nation Address January said despite the many progress pout into place to combat the maniac, corruption remains a formidable force to battle-but progress have been made during the last five years.. The US Government's report particularly pointed at widespread corruption including bribery and extortion in the country's justice system with jurors and police officers at center stage. Solicitor General Wilkins Wrights in his report to the cabinet admitted to the claim by stating that one of the obstacles in fighting corruption is the jury system. Cllr. Wright noted that corruption related acts are committed by citizens...and can b e classified as high or low ranging from economic sabotage to bribery. The Solicitor General called for a total reform of the Jury System. The US report claimed that ""Official corruption and the sense of a culture of impunity were exacerbated by low pay levels for the civil service, lack of job training, and a lack of court convictions."" ""The government dismissed officials for alleged corruption and recommended others for prosecution,"" stated the report. The Liberian Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC) and the Ministry of Justice are responsible for exposing and combating official corruption. The LACC is empowered to prosecute any case that the Ministry of Justice declines to prosecute; however, the Ministry had not declined to prosecute any such cases during the year. The LACC, the report noted, which had a minimal budget and insufficient staff, investigated eight cases and recommended four for prosecution. Included in the recommendations were former Inspector General of Police Beatrice Munah Sieh (now a representative aspirant in the pending elections) for irregularities in the appropriation of uniforms and two Ministry of Finance officials for their alleged roles in misappropriating civil service salary checks. The LACC reported 21 additional corruption cases were pending investigation by year's end. The report: ""Judges were susceptible to bribes from damages that they awarded in civil cases. Judges sometimes requested bribes to try cases, release detainees from prison, or find defendants not guilty in criminal cases. Defense attorneys and prosecutors sometimes suggested that defendants pay a gratuity to appease judges, prosecutors, jurors, and police officers or to secure favorable rulings from them. Jurors were also susceptible to bribes, and the Ministry of Justice increased its calls to reform the jury system."" It said despite her strong emphasis on decentralization, President Sirleaf froze County Development Funds pending ongoing audits due to evidence of frequent misuse. The Funds were intended to support local development projects to reduce poverty. The move to recentralize administration of local development projects was widely seen as a result of inadequate local management, which often funneled development funds to support political interests of legislators rather than to reduce poverty. Following is an excerpt of the report: ""The government dismissed or suspended a number of officials for corruption stated the report. For example, in April the comptroller for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a senior financial officer were dismissed for allegedly stealing $4,500 intended for the country's embassy in Nigeria. In May the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization recommended six officers for prosecution for collusion in the escape of six Bangladeshi detainees. The case was pending investigation at year's end. In June the National Security Agency arrested three Ministry of Finance officials for soliciting bribes of $10,000 each from the Cocopa Rubber Plantation Company. The case was pending investigation at year's end. On September 24, the government dropped the 2007 economic sabotage case against former National Transitional Government of Liberia chair Charles Gyude Bryant due to a lack of evidence. On October 12, President Sirleaf recommended senior officials for dismissal and referred others for further investigation for their involvement in the Carbon Harvesting Corporation deal, a carbon-credit agreement containing irregularities that would have resulted in significant loss of government revenue. The investigation of the former assistant superintendent for development in Grand Cape Mount County was pending at year's end following his October 2009 dismissal for involvement in the disappearance of approximately $90,000 from the Grand Cape Mount County Development Fund. The March 2009 case against the former minister of information Lawrence Bropleh was dismissed with prejudice on December 7. The dismissal cited the prosecution's alleged failure to appear in court; however, the Ministry of Justice contested the judge's claim. A writ of prohibition to undo the judge's decision was before the Supreme Court at year's end. Police corruption was a problem. During the year the LNP investigated reports of police misconduct or corruption, and authorities suspended or dismissed several LNP officers. For example, in August an LNP officer was charged with property theft and was awaiting trial at the end of the year. In June a senior LNP official was accused of assaulting an individual over a personal misunderstanding. The official was suspended and ordered to pay restitution; however, no restitution was made and he remained suspended by the end of the year. On October 9, the LNP director announced the implementation of complaint forms to be submitted by the public to report incidents of bribery or unethical practices. In November an LNP officer was arrested for allegedly permitting his acquaintances to use his police uniform to commit acts of armed robbery. He was released and returned to duty due to a lack of evidence. There were no developments in the September 2009 case of the former Monrovia chief of patrol indicted for looting the house of a private prosecutor. During the year the government continued to take steps to improve transparency. The General Audit Commission continued its ministerial audits and referred findings to the legislature. However, the legislature did not recommend any cases to the Ministry of Justice for prosecution."""146,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),4/28/11,LCC Plot Scam Exposes PF Corruption,,ZAMBIA (95%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,28-Apr-11,"LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (95%)",633  words,CORRUPTION (94%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); POLITICS (90%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%); CITY GOVERNMENT (90%); MAYORS (89%); CITIES (89%); HOUSING AUTHORITIES (78%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (78%); FINANCIAL CRIME COUNTERMEASURES (78%); CONSTRUCTION (77%); INTERVIEWS (77%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (75%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (74%); MONEY LAUNDERING (73%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (73%); LEGISLATION (66%); ROAD & BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION (50%); HIGHWAYS & STREETS (50%) Zambia; Crime and Corruption,"The Government has said the high-level corruption exposed at the Lusaka City Council has exposed the Patriotic Front (PF) inherent appetite for corruption and warned Zambians to be wary of the opposition party ahead of the elections this year. In an interview in Lusaka yesterday, Local Government and Housing Minister Brian Chituwo said PF president Michael Sata had been accusing the Government of being corrupt but had not issued a statement to condemn his councillors and MPs. Dr Chituwo said Zambians must judge which of the two parties was corrupt following allegations that MPs who had been named in the PF shadow cabinet were named as beneficiaries of the 102 plots that were irregularly shared. The minister said the on-going investigations at the country's biggest council had revealed deep scandals apart from the Lilayi Housing project. Dr Chituwo said the team had continued receiving submissions from the members of the public on many other irregularities that were unknown, which forced him to extend the suspension from the initial 90 days for another three months. He said the Government had faced a lot of accusations that it was corrupt but the PF had failed to provide evidence for the law-enforcement officers to investigate. Dr Chituwo said the Government had operated in an open and transparent manner, which had helped raise more resources for the construction of roads and hospitals countrywide. He said avoiding corruption at 100 per cent was impossible in any government but its commitment had been shown with the enactment of new laws such as the Whistle Blowers Act and strengthening of the anti-money laundering systems. The minister urged residents to continue providing reports on what they knew about corruption at the LCC in order to improve service provision for the local government to operate efficiently. Dr Chituwo, who is MMD chairperson for local government, said people were quick at condemning the Government on the basis of the Auditor General's reports but never followed up when recoveries were made. He said the Government always ensured that people mentioned refunded the Government and where crime had been detected, such people were handed over to the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC). Dr Chituwo said the PF had been malicious against the Government and wondered what answers they had over the high levels of corruption at the council. Lusaka City Council was involved in a land scam in which councillors mayors, MPs, PF officials such as secretary general Wynter Kabimba were given plots that were not advertised in line with the law. Later reports indicated that Lusaka Mayor Daniel Chisenga sold oneplot to a resident of Lusaka. The mayor was allocated 10 plots while his deputy had five and the acting town clerk received five. Meanwhile, Dr Chituwo has said the LCC will remain suspended until the investigations that were currently going on are concluded. Dr Chituwo said some of the offences that were leveled against some officials were serious, hence the need for investigations to be allowedto be concluded. Dr Chituwo, who was speaking when he featured on Radio Phoenix's Let the people talk programe on Tuesday said the Government wanted to set up structures that would protect the council from any future abuse from office-bearers. ""How possible is it that one person can get 10 plots? We want to get to the bottom of this for now and for the future,"" Dr Chituwo said. Dr Chituwo said in the event that the investigations established that criminal activities took place within the council, the inquiry would be handed over to the law-enforcement agents for further cause of action. ""I want to tell the nation that the Government is on course but the issues are complex and require time. We have to ensure that the findings are true and fair,"" Dr Chituwo said."148,The New Times (Kigali),5/3/11,Police Cautions the Public Over Corruption,,RWANDA (94%),Newspaper,Superintendent Theos Badege,ENGLISH,,,3-May-11,,166  words,CORRUPTION (94%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (91%); BRIBERY (90%); POLICE FORCES (90%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (73%) Rwanda; Crime and Corruption,"The Rwanda National Police would like to caution the public to steer away from corrupt tendencies.

During her appearance in the Windhoek Magistrate's Court yesterday, Majiedt's lawyer, Bradley Basson, told Magistrate Ruth Herunga that he had no idea how much longer his client would need to stay in hospital.

Public prosecutor Hans Thourob said the State ""will not entertain a formal bail application while the accused is still in hospital"". Majiedt was arrested on April 4 by officials of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC).

This allegedly enabled her to have the cement released from the company's premises where it was picked up by third parties. Majiedt's alleged accomplices - all still at large - then allegedly sold the cement on the black market after which the money was allegedly shared by them. The alleged fraud was detected when Majiedt wrote off stock worth more than N$13 million earlier this year.

Yesterday an official close to the probe confirmed they received information that Gavin van Wyk, who committed suicide recently, may have been an accomplice of Majiedt's. This could however not be confirmed by Acting Director of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), Erna van der Merwe. Gavin van Wyk, a Windhoek businessman and a shareholder in SBS Trucking, committed suicide on April 16 - just five days after his 37th birthday and less than two weeks after Majiedt was arrested. According to Khomas Regional crime investigation coordinator Deputy Commissioner Silvanus Nghishidimbwa, Van Wyk shot himself at his home in Windhoek at about 22h00 on April 16. Nghishidimbwa said Van Wyk left no suicide note. ""What forced him to do that is not known to us."" Van Wyk's body was found by relatives and no foul play is suspected, the Police officer said. SBS Trucking's financial manager, Klaus Beukes, yesterday confirmed that they transported ""four or five loads"" of cement per week for AfriSam from Windhoek to Swakopmund. Beukes also confirmed that they dealt with Majiedt as she was ""chief in charge of everything"". He, however, maintained that there could not have been any underhand dealings. ""I am the financial guy and there is no way that it could have happened. Gavin did not do any invoicing. Our books are open for any investigation."" Majiedt is accused of having manipulated the accounting system of her former employer, AfriSam Cement, over a period of four years. This alleged corruption spree enabled her to have truckloads of cement released from the company's premises, picked up by third parties and sold on the black market. After spending 32 nights under Police guard in hospital, Majiedt was discharged yesterday. Majiedt's lawyer, Bradley Basson confirmed her release from the Windhoek Central Hospital yesterday. Van der Merwe, of the ACC yesterday said the ACC did not doubt the seriousness of the illness that kept Majiedt in hospital for longer than a month. Responding to a question by The Namibian about the possibility that the 46-year-old Majiedt was being hospitalised to delay the legal process, Van der Merwe said: ""That would be a very dangerous thing to say, because I am not a medical practitioner. Doing that would also cast doubt on the credibility of the doctor. It is not something that we would like to question at this stage."" Since her hospitalisation on April 7, Majiedt spent both her birthday and Mother's Day in the Windhoek Central Hospital. She was admitted merely three days after she was nabbed by officials of the anti-graft watchdog. In a medical statement handed in to court recently, it was stated that Majiedt needed to be hospitalised to rest, have her high blood pressure monitored, an ear infection treated and her left leg elevated. She was meant to be returned to the Wanaheda Police station yesterday. Magistrate Ruth Herunga postponed Majiedt's graft case last Thursday to June 1 for further Police investigations to be done. Majiedt, the alleged kingpin in the N$71 million corruption case, is the only one who has been arrested thus far.

Joseph Fitzgerald Kamara also handed over to the president two cheques of six hundred and eleven million, one hundred and forty-one thousand leones (Le611,141,000) and nine thousand four hundred and fifty US dollars ($9,450), being monies recovered from proceeds of corruption. Mr. Kamara informed President Koroma that within the course of the year in review, the ACC had presented to the government a total of one billion, eight hundred million leones (Le1,800,000,000), despite the fact that the commission was not a revenue generating agency. He assured the president that the ACC would continue to complement the work of his government by making sure there were enough recovery proceedings. Kamara also informed the head of state that in the course of the last six months, the commission prosecuted 17 new cases in which there were 8 convictions and 2 acquittals. In his response, President Koroma said he was satisfied with the promptness of the commission. ""I am very pleased that the Anti-Corruption Commission has submitted their report which is an indication of the level of efficiency and the speed with which you are doing things within the organization. So let me start by commending you for the timely submission of the report,"" commented President Koroma. He reaffirmed his government's support to the commission in the fight against corruption, while encouraging them to keep up with the good work. The Annual Report 2010 examines the convictions, cases acquitted and discharged; recovery details; case reports; systems review in ministries, departments and agencies, service charters, development of Codes of Conducts for local councils; community outreach meetings, general challenges, the way forward, and the Financial Report for 2009."153,Concord Times (Freetown),5/16/11,"'In a State Where Corruption Abounds, Laws Must Be Very Numerous' - Tacitus [opinion]",,SIERRA LEONE (97%); UNITED KINGDOM (95%),Newspaper,Ian Hughes,ENGLISH,,,17-May-11,,403  words,CORRUPTION (94%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (76%); POLLS & SURVEYS (66%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (54%) Sierra Leone; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Crime and Corruption,"Sierra Leone has a corruption problem, and Britain is leading efforts to help deal with it. Sometimes I am called a hypocrite for this: how dare Britain criticise corruption here when it exists in Britain too! Not so? Critics who say this misread our motive. Britain does not judge Sierra Leone: corruption is a fact of life everywhere, a crime that stems from human greed just like theft and fraud. As Tacitus told his Roman readers, all countries have to arm themselves with laws to deter, prevent and detect it. All countries need to work together vigorously to keep it in check. Corruption is particularly dangerous for Sierra Leone. It diverts development funds, undermines social programmes and distorts government decisions. Winning the battle against it is essential to address the chronic poverty and deliver prosperity to a nation celebrating its 50th birthday. Sierra Leone has effective anti-corruption legislation and an active Anti Corruption Commission (ACC). I am pleased that the UK is helping by providing encouragement, technical advice and financial support through DFID. But Sierra Leoneans decide priorities, investigate allegations, prosecute the accused and determine their fate: the progress made is entirely theirs. The passionate response to the ACC decision on the NASSIT ferry issue in newspapers, on radio and TV demonstrates that Salones care deeply about that progress. Bravo: in a democracy it is important that government knows that the public is on its side in such a difficult struggle. Yet the public know the struggle is not over. A recent survey commissioned by the ACC shows public perception of continuing corruption in some ministries and in the Sierra Leone Police. While more needs to be done it is an uncomfortable fact that as the ACC gets better, its job gets harder. As it tracks ill-gotten gains through Sierra Leone's banks, corrupt big fish have moved their money off-shore. So last week the Anti Corruption Commissioner and I signed an MOU plugging the ACC into the UK's own system for tracking and combating corruption. This allows it to track ill-gotten gains through banks in the UK and beyond.  It signals Sierra Leone's determination to fight corruption effectively and it demonstrates continued UK support. We are both determined that this MOU will not gather dust on government shelves. Already we are planning how to put it to work.  I'll let you know how we get on."154,The New Times (Kigali),5/16/11,Corruption Fight Effective - Anti Graft Body,,RWANDA (94%),Newspaper,Charles Kwizera And Emma Prince,ENGLISH,,,17-May-11,"KIGALI, RWANDA (79%)",439  words,CORRUPTION (95%); BRIBERY (92%); ETHICS (78%); POLLS & SURVEYS (77%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (74%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (73%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (50%) Rwanda; Crime and Corruption,"A new study by Transparency International (T.I) shows that the fight against corruption is paying off. The study dubbed 'Rwanda Bribery Index (RBI) 2010' measures bribery levels in the private and public sectors Speaking at the launch of the index, last week, the chairperson of Transparency Rwanda, Immaculee Ingabire, pointed out that the research shows that the likelihood of encountering a bribe demand is 3.9 percent while the prevalence of bribery is at 2.15 percent. ""Bribery levels in our country are so low, and we commend all the institutions that fight corruption on a daily basis,"" Ingabire said. The research is the first attempt by any organisation to intensely analyse the current state of this specific form of corruption in the country. Respondents in the survey mention the police as the leading institution in fighting corruption. 43.2 percent said they had faith in the police on fighting corruption followed by the Ombudsman at 17.6 percent and the Presidency at 15.5 percent. The survey dwelt on small bribes and petty corruption. Almost 90 percent of the bribes paid were below Rwf50, 000 while 40.5 percent were below Rwf5, 000. According to the research, the Police has the highest prevalence of bribery rated at eight percent, closely followed by civil society at five percent, village conciliators at 4.2 percent and private sector at 3.2 percent. Bosco Binenwa, an ethics and culture professor at Kigali independent University (ULK), reacting to the report, explained that because Police are law enforcers, it makes them susceptible to bribes. ""They are exposed to bribery from people who fear being apprehended or fined larger sums of money,"" Binenwa said. Police spokesperson, Theos Badege, concurred that the nature of their work makes them prone to bribes, but noted that the institution has mechanisms to facilitate the elimination of the vice. ""We are fighting corruption in every way possible and that is why the Police has come top on the list of the institutions fighting corruption,"" Badege said. He added that taking a bribe is outlawed and all officers within the force are aware of the grave consequences should they be found guilty of taking bribes. Speaking at the launch of the report, the Minister of Local Government, James Musoni said: ""Though the government has put in place a number of ways to check corruption, it is always important to have an outsider's view."" He added that he was confident that such perception surveys would help government to fine-tune zero tolerance strategies to corruption. The Minister urged the civil society and the media to do more in educating the public about corruption."155,New Democrat (Monrovia),5/20/11,Unmil Official's Honest Observations On the Tenants of Corruption,,AFRICA (79%); LIBERIA (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,28-May-11,,510  words,ETHICS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); JURY TRIALS (90%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); INTELLIGENCE & COGNITION (89%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (78%); FOUNDATIONS (76%); EXECUTIVE ORDERS (69%); CONSULTING SERVICES (67%) Liberia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs; International Organizations and Africa,"UNMIL Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary General, Henrietta Mensa-Bonsu, has made some remarkable, but no so strange, suggestions that the government should seriously consider if public confidence in state institutions is to be salvaged. She called for relentless prosecution of corrupt public officials. She said if this is not done, public trust in the government will continue to be eroded. Political institutions are therefore endangered. The official reflected on the oddity within the judicial system, one that allows illiterate men and women to serve on the jury and are expected to render intelligent, fair and acceptable judgments on complicated cases. The UNMIL official further noted that there is a need for a Code of Conduct governing public officials. These are ideas which, if accepted and applied, could mitigate the graft hemorrhage for various reasons. Illiterate jurors, whatever their virtues, cannot understand the complexities of cases for acceptable verdicts. This erodes faith in the judicial system. A Code of Conduct that bars public officials from running NGOs, foundations and other projects or businesses while in office is long over due. Within the prevailing political atmosphere that is free for all, conflict of interest is protected because it opens the avenues for siphoning of public funds into private coffers through NGOs, foundations, etc. Dumping public funds on private projects has been a perennial problem now entrenched, and it will require a revolution, not cosmetic reforms, to alter it. Historically, the entire state bureaucracy--ministries and agencies, etc.-- have been run from private buildings owned by political elites or their extensions. This trend has taken a more sophisticated form, leading to the establishment of declared 'private' enterprises such as cronies-run consultancies through which state funds are channeled. By occupying influential public offices and running NGOs, foundations or businesses, the condition for abuse is created. This is one of the reasons why it has been suggested that donors can better channel funds through the state and its official institutions than via private foundations and NGOs beyond the reach of audits and probe. A Code of Conduct for public officials was one of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's announced priorities. Formulated and adopted, it would have given the public yardstick for measuring performance. But since the pronouncement was made, the idea has simply died. The argument that the Legislature must approve such a Code of Conduct to make it legally binding, however logical, is impractical. This is because this Legislature, unwilling for its members to be audited, is unlikely to subject members to a code of conduct. But what we believe that the President can do is to subject officials within the Executive branch to a Code of Conduct made legal through whatever means, including an Executive Order. It is however never too late. There is a need for a Code of Conduct as the UNMIL official has suggested, with mechanisms to monitor compliance."156,The Namibian (Windhoek),5/23/11,Court Lays Out Proof Needed for Corruption,,NAMIBIA (79%),Newspaper,Werner Menges,ENGLISH,,,28-May-11,,407  words,CORRUPTION (92%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (90%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (90%); MAGISTRATES (89%); SENTENCING (89%); FINES & PENALTIES (78%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (77%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (77%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (77%) Namibia; Corruption,"A POLICE officer who was convicted of corruption after he received a payment of N$2 000 from a complainant in a case he was asked to help investigate has been cleared in an appeal judgement handed down in the High Court last week. The judgement, given on Thursday, is an important ruling with regard to the question of what the prosecution would have to prove to show that a public official who has accepted any form of gratification is guilty of a crime in terms of the Anti-Corruption Act of 2003. It would have to be proven not only that the official has received a payment, but also that the official had a ""guilty mind"" in that the official knew he or she was committing a crime by accepting the payment, is the effect of the judgement by Acting Judge Harald Geier. Judge Naomi Shivute agreed with Acting Judge Geier's ruling. The judgement was given in an appeal that a Police officer, Joel Paulus, lodged after he was convicted in the Otjiwarongo Magistrate's Court on a charge under the Anti-Corruption Act and sentenced to an effective fine of N$5 000 or two years' imprisonment. Paulus was suspended from his work when an Otjiwarongo district farmer, who had asked him to help trace a suspected cattle thief, paid him N$2 000 on October 24 2006. According to the farmer and Paulus the money was to help cover petrol and travelling expenses. The farmer decided to approach Paulus, whom he knew as an effective Police officer, for assistance after he felt frustrated by the inaction of the Police at Otjiwarongo, the trial court was told. By accepting the money, though, Paulus's conduct fell squarely within the ambit of conduct prohibited by the Anti-Corruption Act, Geier found. Geier found that the Anti-Corruption Act does not criminalise conduct on the basis of strict liability, where it would be sufficient for the prosecution to prove only that the law had been transgressed without taking into account what the state of mind of the alleged offender was. To prove the offence that Paulus was accused of, the prosecution would also have to prove that an accused person had a ""guilty mind"", in that the person knew what he or she was doing was against the law, the court found. The evidence before the magistrate showed that it was not for any dishonest or corrupt motive or purpose that a request for assistance was made and the N$2 000 was offered and accepted, the court further found. Paulus's conviction and sentence were set aside."157,The Namibian (Windhoek),5/26/11,Anti-Corruption Lacks in Key Areas - IPPR,,NAMIBIA (95%),Newspaper,Nico Smit,ENGLISH,,,30-May-11,,479  words,CORRUPTION (96%); PUBLIC POLICY (90%); LEGISLATION (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (78%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (78%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (77%); STATE OWNED BUSINESSES (50%); WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION (50%) Namibia; Corruption,"DESPITE extensive legislation aimed at fighting corruption, the Namibian anti-corruption laws do not go far enough in regulating against the potential for corrupt behaviour, according to the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). In the first of the eight research papers to be published under its newly launched anti-corruption research programme this year, the IPPR has reviewed the anti-corruption law and related legislation in Namibia, identified key shortcomings and has made a number of recommendations. Lacking an over-arching national anti-corruption policy or strategy, Namibia has been unable to spell out the linkages between the various laws and agencies to create a united front against corruption. The IPPR have noted that agencies responsible for fighting corruption, such as the ACC, have been operating in ""jurisdictional bubbles,"" with very little cooperation and coordination between them. This lack of coordination and cooperation does not only exist between law enforcement agencies, but ""appears to permeate the workings of the entire public sector."" Despite the law being clear and far sighted, this indicates a general lack of understanding of the role of the ACC.Inadequate skills capacity and expertise within the public sector has become a serious concern in the fight against corruption and service delivery in general. ""The lack of relevant and sufficient skills and resources at every and various junctures in the criminal justice chain charged with combating graft necessarily affects the quality of the state's response to such destructive practices."" Furthermore, Namibia's judicial system appears to have become a considerable stumbling block to the effectiveness of anti-corruption efforts, according to the IPPR. Not only has the slow turning of the wheels of justice undermined the integrity of the work of agencies such as the ACC, as well as the applicability of various laws, ""but has also had a dampening effect on the public's faith in, support and enthusiasm for the overall anti-corruption fight."" Adequate protection of whistle-blowers or informants has also become a serious concern. A further ""glaring omission"" within anti-corruption legislation is the absence of an access to information policy and law. As a result, the IPPR says Namibia is lacking on the important issues of transparency and accountability, as ""a culture of openness has yet to take hold within and between the state and broader society."" Amongst others, the IPPR has recommended that each ministry, state agency, regional and local authority, and state-owned enterprise should be required to submit to Parliament an annual anti-corruption plan. IPPR has recommended that the ACC together with the receiver of revenue be empowered to conduct lifestyle audits where it is clear that private persons and public figures are living beyond their reported incomes."158,The New Times (Kigali),5/31/11,Gakenke Lost Rwf 90 Million Through Corruption - District Officials,,RWANDA (79%),Newspaper,Bonny Mukombozi,ENGLISH,,,1-Jun-11,,258  words,EMBEZZLEMENT (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); BUDGETS (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (73%); ARRESTS (72%); BAIL (71%) Rwanda; Corruption,"Four top officials in Gakenke District are being investigated in connection with the loss of Rwf 90 million. A special session of the District Advisory Council which convened last week sacked the newly elected vice mayor in charge of Economic development, Clemence Ugiribanga and the embattled District Executive Secretary, Richard Mberabagabo, overhauling the entire district team within its third month in office. Mberabagabo was arrested and released on bail last week in connection with the scandal. Others sacked include the district accountant, Jean Claude Surwume, and the district budget officer Peter Kwizera. The district council, held the three liable for the loss of over Rwf 49 million, through cheques and payment orders signed by Mberabagabo and Ugiribanga, when she acted as Director of Administration and Finance. It emerged that more funds were swindled in several Sectors. For instance, in Busengo Sector, a VUP-Umurenge financial officer is said to have disappeared with Rwf 16 million belonging to SACCO, while in Mugunga Sector, over Rwf 2 million was also embezzled. The District Mayor, Deogratius Nzabamwita, disclosed that further investigations were underway to unearth 'the network' of people involved in embezzling over Rwf90m, in the last two years. The district vowed to pursue the culprits and ensure that money is refunded. The president of the District Advisory Council, Patrice Hakizimana, said that money was withdrawn from the district account 7 times, and those charged with financial management failed to do their jobs."160,The New Times (Kigali),6/2/11,Governor Intervenes in Gakenke Corruption Scandal,,RWANDA (79%),Newspaper,Bonny Mukombozi,ENGLISH,,,2-Jun-11,,215  words,CORRUPTION (92%); TALKS & MEETINGS (91%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (90%); SCANDALS (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); PUBLIC FINANCE (88%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (77%); BUDGETS (76%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (73%) Rwanda; Corruption,"As Gakenke District grapples with corruption scandals, the Provincial Governor, Aime Bosenibamwe, on Tuesday met with district leaders.

In the second of eight research papers to be published under its anti-corruption research programme this year, the IPPR reviewed Namibia's approach to conflict of interest in the political, public and private spheres, and has made a number of recommendations. In the political realm, the focus is on Parliament and the Assets Register, which requires Members of Parliament to disclose assets and interests. Asset declaration can help in the fight against corruption by reducing instances of conflict of interest and can be used as a tool to identify cases of illicit enrichment. However, a Register of Member's Interests, the National Assembly Assets Register, has only been published twice since independence, in 2003 and 2009 respectively. The IPPR notes that in both cases, asset disclosure, which is a requirement in the National Assembly and the National Council, by senior political figures was less than satisfactory. The problems surrounding the Register of Member's Interests ""run deeper and are reflective of a broader malaise - a general political culture which does not view accountability as a component of legitimacy."" This, the IPPR says, is illustrated by the fact that political parties in Namibia are amongst the most unregulated institutions, and do not have to account for or disclose their assets and interests to any agency in Namibia, despite many of them receiving considerable amounts of tax-payer money on an annual basis. In the public sector, the situation is similar to that of political office bearers, as the rules governing the conduct of public sector employees do not go far enough, and are not proactive enough in encouraging ethical conduct in the civil service. This is evident in that the Public Service Act is ""decidedly passive"" in dealing with the issue of potential conflict of interest, as it relies almost entirely on the integrity and honesty of individual civil servants to declare their outside interests. Furthermore, there is no mechanism to proactively monitor whether public service employees actually comply with the provisions of the Public Service Act. In the private sector, the IPPR identifies ""labour representatives - out for self-enrichment - colluding with management rather than representing employees interests,"" as the ""most obvious avenue for conflict of interest in the private sector."" An important first step in preventing the damage done by the practice of conflict of interest and its consequences, is a ""clear and comprehensive, if not watertight, regulatory environment"" for dealing with the practice. The IPPR notes that Namibia appears to be falling short in understanding the nature and scope of conflict of interest, as it relates to corruption, which is reflected in the country's lack of an all-inclusive approach to deal with the issue. In broad terms, the IPPR recommends legislation similar to South Africa's Executive Member's Ethics Act be introduced including codes of ethical conduct for the various levels of the public service. Furthermore, it has called for access to information to be legislated and that a national access to information policy be introduced. A more progressive and proactive regime where ministers and presiding officers publicly and comprehensively list their interests has also been recommended by the IPPR. Such a regime would also require senior officials, such as CEO's and senior management of state-owned enterprises and Permanent Secretaries, to disclose outside business interests on an annual basis."162,Concord Times (Freetown),6/6/11,ACC Takes Corruption Fight to PLTC,,SIERRA LEONE (92%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,6-Jun-11,,563  words,CORRUPTION (95%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (90%); PUBLIC SCHOOLS (89%); TEACHER EDUCATION (89%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (89%); UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (77%); FINES & PENALTIES (76%); CRIMINAL FINES (76%) Sierra Leone; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"In a bid to address key corruption issues at the Port Loko Teachers College (PLTC), the Anti-Corruption Commission has engaged staff and students of all departments. Officers of the Northern Regional office on Wednesday 1st June 2011 in a sensitization meeting warned all to desist from corrupt practices. Speaking on the offences and penalties as contained in the 2008 Act, Public Education Officer, Al-Hassan Sesay informed staff and students that the commission has the mandate to investigate all forms of corruption, no matter the amount of money or individual involved. Sesay explained various offences which are common in learning institutions and emphasized that the punishment for such offences is a fine of not less than thirty (30) million Leones or imprisoned of not less than three (3) years or both fine and prison term. Sesay highlighted key corrupt practices taking place in colleges which he noted are obstacles for development. He told staff and students that the ACC is not witch-hunting anybody or institution but intervening wherever there are possible loopholes for corruption. He therefore called on them to desist from corrupt practices and change their negative attitudes for the development of Sierra Leone. Explaining the rationale for the meeting, ACC's District Coordinator for Port Loko, Sahid Kamara said the engagement was part of the commission's public education and preventive approach in the fight against corruption. He emphasized that the commission decided to engage them to discuss key corruption issues and solicit their support in addressing them. The District Coordinator added that the meeting was to educate them on the dangers of corruption, work of the commission, how corrupt practices in their operations can hinder the development of education and how they can join the fight against it. Giving an overview of the commission, Public Education Officer Fatmata Finda Bockarie emphasized that the fight against corruption is a national concern, noting that the ACC alone cannot fight graft in the country. She told all staff and students present that the commission is not just bent on arresting and prosecuting corrupt individuals but also changing the corrupt behaviour, opinion, attitude and thoughts of people. The Public Education Officer emphasized the commission's core value of confidentiality and professionalism and stressed that if the fight against corruption is to succeed, they must be ready to resist, reject and report corruption. She explained the various methods of making reports to the commission, protection of informers and the 10% reward. Ms. Bockarie read the free mobile hotlines of the commission and urged staff and students to report any act of corruption. In their welcome address, Principal of Port Loko Teachers College Mr. Ibrahim William Saspo Bangura and President of the Student Union, Hassan Yansaneh expressed appreciation to ACC for bringing the commission closer to them. They admitted that such engagement will go a long way to minimize corruption at the college. They heaped praises on the commission for according them the opportunity to learn more about its activities and what they should not do. They assured the commission that they will abide by the warnings and stand firm against any act of corruption in the college. Questions and answers, suggestions and comments formed part of the meeting."163,Concord Times (Freetown),6/6/11,ACC Takes Corruption Fight to Lebanese Community,,SIERRA LEONE (94%); LEBANON (94%); ASIA (79%); AFRICA (79%),Newspaper,By David Kanekey Conteh,ENGLISH,,,6-Jun-11,,618  words,"CORRUPTION (93%); TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (89%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (77%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (72%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (71%); INVESTIGATIONS (70%) Sierra Leone; Corruption; Asia, Australia, and Africa","The Anti-Corruption Commission on Saturday 28th May 2011 met with the Lebanese community in Kenema, in a meeting that attracted about nineteen (19) Lebanese businessmen and their business agents at the Lebanese International School hall in Kenema town. Declaring the purpose of the meeting, the Kenema district coordinator of the ACC, Mohamed Sylvanus Blake, said the Lebanese community is strategic to the economy of Sierra Leone as they contribute immensely to the revenue of this nation through taxes and other dues they pay. He emphasized that in the course of running their businesses, they face several challenges, as they come in contact with public officers in government ministries, departments and agencies and interact with people from every facet of life, including the common man. He added that partnership with the ACC will enhance their business and prevent exploitation from public officers. He encouraged them to make adequate use of the presence of the ACC in Kenema, stressing that the commission prefers making converts rather than convicts of corruption. In his overview of the commission, the interim eastern regional manager of the ACC, Peter Baio Kamara explained the three-pronged approach that the commission employs in the fight against corruption, namely Public Education, System and Process Review, and Intelligence, Investigation and Prosecution. Sound and adequate knowledge of the commission and its operations, Mr. Kamara said, will help people identify what makes them culpable by law, desist from corrupt acts and join the fight against the menace. Kamara further spoke about the report centre and its operations and how it receives and processes reports received from the public. He said some reports sent to the ACC are not corruption related but that the commission endeavours to respond appropriately to all reports received so as not to frustrate the efforts of those sending them. He encouraged participants to report corruption and assured them of the commission's protection and confidentiality. Earlier in his opening remarks, the eastern regional public education officer, David Kanekey Conteh alluded to the fact that there are third and fourth generation Lebanese that see Sierra Leone as their home. Therefore, the progress of Sierra Leone is their concern, and whatever befalls this nation affects them also. Even though the Lebanese run private business entities, their interactions with public officers and the public make such a meeting very necessary. Mr. Conteh highlighted some of the offences likely to be committed by private business people, such as offering an advantage, corrupting a public officer, using influence for contract, bid rigging, to name a few. He gave them the hot lines they could use to report corruption. Responding, the chairman of the Lebanese community in Kenema, Alhaji Ali Hassan thanked the ACC for creating such a forum which he referred to as awareness raising and confidence building.  He said poetically that the eye has been watching alone, the ear joined the eye, now he is asking the mouth to join the ear and the eye in the fight against corruption by not keeping silent. Alhaji Ali Hassan lamented over the duplication of the payment of taxes and other licenses to both the central and local governments, the illegal importation of goods to the country through smuggling; acts he said sometimes frustrate them and other issues affecting them. He called on the ACC to bring these issues to the attention of the government, while promising that the Lebanese in Kenema will continue to remain law abiding. He pledged the support and cooperation of the Lebanese to the commission and asked for more of such engagements in future."164,The New Times (Kigali),6/10/11,Nation's Anti-Corruption Pace Outstanding - Governance Council,,RWANDA (93%),Newspaper,Edwin Musoni,ENGLISH,,,10-Jun-11,,188  words,CORRUPTION (92%); TRENDS (76%) Rwanda; Corruption,"The Executive Secretary of the Rwanda Governance Advisory Council (RGAC), Prof. Anastase Shyaka, has announced that the country has made impressive strides in the fight against graft and is on the right path to become a corruption-free state.

Majiedt, who faces a corruption charge totalling more than N$71 million, allegedly disbursed cement valued at N$42 million to Discount Hardware and N$16 million's cement to Cool Properties without AfriSam, her former employer, receiving a single penny despite claims by the Calvyn and Gerhard Bezuidenhoudt of Cool Properties and Daniel de Jesus of Discount Hardware that they paid bags of cash to Majiedt. The difference between this total of N$58 million (N$42 million and N$16 million) comprises N$13 million worth of stock that Majiedt allegedly wrote off. When Botes asked Namukwambi on Friday who the people are who allegedly paid money to Majiedt and who because of that are a threat to her life, she said: ""I cannot reveal the names - this is not the time."" Botes also wanted to know from her what basis she has for such a serious allegation claiming that Majiedt could be harmed or killed, the investigating officer said: ""I will come and answer the question when the need arises."" She added that she regards the Police cells - where up to 35 inmates are detained- ""as a safe custody for the accused"". When Botes asked whether Namukwambi regards the alleged accomplices, the Bezuidenhoudts and De Jesus, as suspects or as State witnesses, Namukwambi maintained that the investigation has not been completed. ""After completion [of the probe], we can decide what to do with those people."" She denied that she had testified on Thursday that there ""is no doubt"" that these men were in cahoots with Majiedt. Public Prosecutor Hans Thourob earlier said one of the grounds on which the State objects to bail is that it would not be in the public interest. Botes wanted to know from Namukwambi what this is based on, and whether there has been a public march against Majiedt's possible release. Namukwambi answered that ""it's not necessary for people to demonstrate [against Majiedt's release on bail]. The public outcry will be there until the case is finalised, whether they demonstrate or not."" When the hearing continues on Wednesday, Thourob is expected to call a former colleague of Majiedts, Zebbie van Zyl, to testify against Majiedt being freed on bail after she had allegedly interfered with the investigation against her. During her testimony last week, Majiedt admitted that she met Van Zyl in the parking lot at the Ministry of Finance where she asked him for a company stamp. The multimillion dollar alleged fraudster, however, denied that she also asked him to supply her with blank invoices. Thourob earlier said the State is in possession of a recording of the conversation between the two. Majiedt was arrested in Windhoek on April 4 this year. Since her arrest, she has spent 32 nights in hospital under Police guard for various ailments. Botes acts on Majiedt's behalf on instruction of Bradley Basson. Magistrate Ruth Herunga is on the bench for the bail hearing."166,The Herald (Harare),6/22/11,Local Firm in Drive Against Corruption,,ZIMBABWE (93%); UNITED STATES (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,23-Jun-11,,582  words,CORRUPTION (94%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (91%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (89%); BANKING & FINANCE (89%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (89%); INTERNET RETAILING (85%); HUMAN RESOURCES (78%); COMPANY PROFITS (78%); CORPORATE WRONGDOING (78%); AGREEMENTS (78%); INTERNAL AUDITS (77%); BUSINESS & PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS (76%); BUSINESS OPERATIONS (74%); BANKING & FINANCE SECTOR PERFORMANCE (74%); TECHNICIANS & TECHNOLOGICAL WORKERS (74%); FORENSICS (73%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (73%); CURRENCIES (72%); INTERVIEWS (70%); RISK MANAGEMENT (69%); ELECTRONIC COMMERCE (65%); PURCHASING & PROCUREMENT (61%); SOCIAL MEDIA (60%) Zimbabwe; Corruption,"A local firm, Compact Training of Zimbabwe, will soon partner the Anti-Corruption Commission of Zimbabwe in the fight against white-collar crime in both the private and public sectors. Since the switch from the Zimbabwean dollar to the multi-currency system, there has been an unprecedented rise in fraud and corruption in business. Under the envisioned partnership, the two entities will help business organisations and public sector bodies to detect fraudulent and corrupt activities in business. CTZ official Mr Trueman Dehwe said in an interview, there has been a surge in fraud in companies that has prompted many organisations to engage skilled professionals to help detect such activities before they negatively impacted on company operations and profitability. ""An agreement (with the Anti-Corruption Commission) is expected to be reached soon as it has only been delayed by the restructuring process currently being undertaken by the commission. We are, however, confident that we will be working together in the near future. ""We have been hosting and facilitating a good number of conferences and over the period demand for fraud detection expertise has steadily increased. ""It is against this background that we have decided to move a step further by including a Government arm,"" said Mr Dehwe. He added that white-collar crime is currently pervasive in virtually all the sectors of the economy, but most particularly in the financial services sector. Added Mr Dehwe: ""Over the years, there has been increased demand from financial companies for workshops that are targeted at combating fraud and corruption and also help in financial management. ""A leading financial institution recently tasked us to draft a financial plan for them and also an insurance company has requested us to facilitate a training programme for them from Kesdee of the United States since we are certified training partners."" Due to the proliferation of technology and valued added products from the Information Communication Technology sector, there are programmes that have also been designed to ensure that businesses understand some of the pitfalls on the electronic marketplace, which has occasioned by e-commerce. From Monday next week, CTZ will he holding a three-day workshop in Nyanga that is tailored to train locals about the electronic marketplace, internet, e-commerce and online business. The workshop will highlight the components and functioning of the e-marketplace, identification of the threats in the e-marketplace and the social media threats in the electronic marketplace. The workshops will culminate in a convention dubbed ""Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Conference and Workshop"" that will be held in Victoria Falls in August. The convention will mainly be targeting bankers, IT personnel, stores managers, purchasing managers, loss control managers, human resources managers, administration managers, internal and forensic auditors. Speakers at the event will include Dr Jar Botha, Professor Barry Splitz, Mr Mashandu Ramano, Mr Peter Peddler and Mr Bart Handerson. Last year CTZ partnered Henderson Solutions of South Africa in order to come up with practical solutions on combating fraud. It also partnered Kesdee of the US and the Euromoney Institute. Delegates who have attended previous workshops include those from the ministries of Economic Planning and Investment Promotion and Home Affairs, Ernst & Young, Zimra, Zesa Holdings, TelOne, Zimnat Life Assurance and financial institutions like TN Bank."167,The New Times (Kigali),6/24/11,Judiciary Sacks 12 Over Corruption,,RWANDA (79%),Newspaper,Bosco R.

Five workers who include two Presidents of Primary courts, two registrars and a judge, were sacked on grounds of soliciting bribes and swindling government funds. Judicial Spokesperson, Charles Kaliwabo, confirmed the development in a telephone interview. ""They were irrevocably dismissed by the judicial high council which was chaired by the Chief Justice [Aloysie Cyanzayire] after analysing their files,"" Kaliwabo said. Among those dismissed is the Registrar of Rushashi Primary Court, Modeste Barakengera. Kaliwabo said he was suspended for doctoring a case file. ""He (Barakengera) forged a case file,"" he added, without giving the details on the file case in question. Also fired were Elias Nsengimana and Janvier Muhire of Mugombwa and Kagarama primary courts respectively. Kaliwabo explained that seven others, who include five registrars of the Intermediate Court and one of the High Court of Kigali, were dismissed by the council for desertion. ""They had applied for leave-of-absence, but they left before the council decided on their requests as prescribed by the law. The council, therefore, decided to null their applications and dismissed them from the judiciary,"" he said. Kaliwabo also disclosed that the contracts of three other contractual judges, one attached to Nyarugunga primary court and two others of Nyarugenge Primary court, were revoked on corruption grounds. ""We have networks of establishing such corrupt officials. The judiciary does not tolerate any sort of misconduct. Corruption is at zero tolerance and anyone implicated in this act will be pursued accordingly,"" he noted. Most of the sacked lawyers, Kaliwabo explained were reported by the public following the February-Week of fighting corruption in the judicial sector. ""The public should know that they are not supposed to buy their rights. We need their cooperation, especially in fighting corruption,"" he stated, adding that the judiciary established a hotline (3670) for the public to report any form of corruption. He, however, added that some members of public were also arrested trying to bribe judges. This month alone, he said, two people were arrested in Musanze and Karongi districts for trying to bribe judges."168,Concord Times (Freetown),6/28/11,Anti-Corruption Commission Engages Nacsa in Kenema [opinion],,SIERRA LEONE (92%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,29-Jun-11,,667  words,CORRUPTION (95%); TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (89%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (89%); PUBLIC SCHOOLS (89%); LAWYERS (69%); INVESTIGATIONS (69%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (69%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (69%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (68%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (64%); MISAPPROPRIATION (50%) Sierra Leone; Corruption,"As part of the institutional approach to public education and external outreach, the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) on Wednesday 22nd June 2011 met with both district and regional staff of the National Commission for Social Action (NaCSA) at their regional office at Hangah Road, Kenema. The meeting commenced with the ACC's regional public education officer, David Kanekey Conteh explaining the purpose for such engagement with officials of NaCSA. Mr. Conteh said ACC's visit to NaCSA does not necessarily denote any suspicion, neither does it mean that NaCSA was corrupt, but it was part of the efforts of the commission to recruit public officers to the anti-corruption army. As the fight is a national one, he emphasized, the ACC cannot fight alone and that it was enlisting every Sierra Leonean into this formidable force. Mr. Conteh further said that even though ignorance of the law was no excuse, public officers at times contravene the laws out of ignorance and that raising awareness of what constitutes corruption or corrupt practice was the first step in addressing corruption. ""Public officers are therefore advised to always work within the provisions of the law as they provide leadership in various capacities,"" he admonished. In his overview of the commission, ACC's acting regional manager East, Peter Baio Kamara said before the enactment of the AC Act 2008 which gave the commission extensive powers, matters investigated by it were sent to the Attorney General's office for prosecution. The process was very slow and stifled most of the efforts of the commission, he said, adding that the pace at which the commission was now addressing matters was based on the new provisions of the 2008 ACC Act. Mr. Kamara informed his audience that the ACC laid premium on public education ""because education brings knowledge and knowledge empowers people"". He however said that people often thought that the ACC's success story was based on the number of public officers sent to court and incarcerated. On the contrary, ""ACC does not pride itself in having lots of convicts but prefers converts"". He observed that since corruption operates in a system, the ACC was also involved in what he referred to as a review of systems and processes in MDAs, which according to him, helped in preventing corrupt practices. Recommendations made during these reviews are monitored to ascertain and assess the level of compliance, he said. ACC's Kenema district coordinating officer, Mohamed Sylvanus Blake, highlighted several offences such as corrupting a public officer, bid rigging, using influence for contract, misappropriation of public funds, influencing a public officer, impeding investment, as part of the corrupt practices in the Anti-Corruption Act 2008. He informed NaCSA officers that involving in any of these practices may attract several related offences which may invoke a fine of not less than thirty million leones or three years imprisonment or both fine and imprisonment, for each offence. He encouraged them to report corruption to the ACC as there is always protection for informants and witnesses. He stressed that nobody will jeopardize his or her job or position for reporting corruption. Mr. Blake added that there is a ten percent reward scheme for anyone who reports corruption and such report leads to recovery of misappropriated funds. Responding, the NaCSA regional coordinator Mahmoud Koroma said NaCSA is involved in community, social action, relief and resettlement programs, among others. He added that NaCSA does not implement projects directly but through the communities or by employing the services of licensed contractors. Mr. Koroma appreciated the ACC for their move in educating them on many issues that they were unfamiliar with and asked that the ACC makes available the 2008 Act to them as they may want to use it as a reference point. Participants asked several questions that were responded to by the team of ACC Officers.

This caution was given at an emergency meeting of JSS Principals in Kenema convened by the ACC and the Eastern Regional Chairman of the Conference of Principals, Sandy Moijueh at the Government Secondary School hall in Kenema. In his opening address, the chairman, Sandy Moijueh said he was met by a three man team of ACC officers who raised a number of issues bothering on illegal and extra charges levied on pupils which is why the meeting was convened. He called on all presents to listen attentively to the ACC officers. Explaining the purpose of the meeting, the Acting Regional Manager of the Anti-Corruption Commission Peter Baio Kamara stated that during the usual ACC weekly radio discussion programme, parents and guardians have repeatedly phoned in to complain that school authorities levy extra charges on pupils as a precondition for issuing admission or identification notices especially for the BECE candidates and for report cards, practical work and even for submission of assignments. Such charges, he stated, are illegal if not sanctioned by the Ministry of Education or have not been agreed on unanimously by parents at CTA meetings and minutes of such meetings forwarded to the Ministry of Education for their approval. Mr. Kamara stated they are in constant touch with the Directorate of the Ministry of Education in Kenema to crosscheck and ascertain whether such charges are sanctioned by the ministry. He stated in no uncertain terms that the ACC frowns at such charges and warned all school authorities to work in consonance with existing laws, policies and procedures governing the administration of schools and school charges. Peter Kamara suggested a range of measures school authorities could employ to avoid imposing extra financial burden on parents especially. He said it is very unfair to prevent pupils from taking an examination because of non payment of fees for extra classes especially when composite fees have been paid. Kamara called on all the Principals present to do all within their powers to ensure such practice does not take place in their schools as the Anti-Corruption Commission will leave no stone unturned in its effort to fight corruption through the investigation of such allegations and subsequent prosecution of any school authority found culpable. Responding, Principals present outlined some of the issues that they said were bottle necks in the effective administration of their schools, such as the shifting of the responsibility of Batch Registration Scheme (BRS) from West African Examination Council (WAEC) to respective schools with all its budget obligations, the decision to have extra remedial lessons agreed upon at CTA meetings by parents, and the non-payment of school fees by parents/guardians leaving the school authorities in critical positions and delays in the payment of girl child subsidy by the Ministry of Education  among others. The Principals also noted that pupils in a bid to extort monies from their parents inflate school fees and hide behind extra charges. They expressed satisfaction over the move by the ACC officers to address these issues and registered their preparedness to work within the legal framework and cooperate with the ACC. In his statement, the national president of the Conference of Principals, Michael Samba commended the move by the ACC and maintained that they as administrators are responsible for the implementation of government policies on education in schools for a better Sierra Leone and as such the government should create the enabling environment for them to function effectively and efficiently. He encouraged his colleagues to use the media extensively to educate the public on their constraints as administrators of education as that will help change the perception of the public about them. Mr. Samba maintained that the concerns raised by the ACC are realistic even though they as administrators may not be aware of such activities going on in their schools and asked his colleague Principals to be vigilant in the monitoring of their staff to ensure that they strictly operate within the legal framework prescribed in policies and procedures. He promised that the caution will be taken into consideration and acted upon.

Such incidents also give insight to the apparent social winds of change permeating many world societies especially in our longitudes. Assuming the accuracy of the press reports, Nankudhu, whatever one's political standpoint, was a hero of Namibia but left to rot. Later damage control by the politicians to correct this image makes no difference to the departed hero! The 120 kids, reportedly moved out because of a GRN survey (?), although probably an ""unintended consequence"", reflects equally badly. Leaving kids by the road in winter is an unspeakable sin. Thanks goodness the Rundu man took matters in hand; but GRN remains tarnished. National pride is easily dented. It such unpredictable incidents, that while not intentional (I hope), become more likely as our political system and the executive become more and more focussed upon themselves and less upon the people. Jacob Zuma's recent comments that ""weakness emerges from strength"" as political incumbents with large majorities take decisions in their own interest rather than those that they should in the interests of their communities (Cosatu conference, 26/06/11). The people are patient but ! The poor and exposed eventually have ""nothing to lose"". Equally international bodies, once of high repute are coming under fire. FIFA's ethics committee has pronounced on the corruption surrounding leadership elections; yes, ""bags of cash"" (the new model of diplomacy?) were handed out by Warner, appropriately titled Vice President, to buy Caribbean votes. And well done Damaseb (a GRN / Swapo stalwart) as Vice Chair and part of the process; a plus for National Pride. But what happens? Warner, threatening talk on exposure, walks away, blemish free in deafening silence. Back to politics! And the FIFA President was unaware . ? Locally our minds are challenged in similar ways. Despite apparent prima facie evidence published by the GIPF in the press authorities are withholding two reports on these massive losses. Whatever those reports contain it is in the public domain that the Trustees,quite obviously failed in their fiduciary duties and there are clear incidents of conflict of interest. And this is only in the DCP area! There are other areas. It is therefore not unreasonable to suggest due process is being avoided as people in high position are implicated. If not, just release the reports or we have to assume statements about zero tolerance of poor governance and corruption are empty promises. And the RDF? The current Arab disturbances where the elite are protecting their own interests through outrageous violence are well documented by others but are a social reaction of note. A subject on which I have already made my views clear. But the Greek situation, the land where Aristotle, Socrates and Plato (and many others) created the first models of democracy is relevant. The Greeks, over the years have become famous for poor tax collection, overpaid and ineffective government and living beyond their means. They even ""lost"" debt with US investment bankers hiding the truth. Life was good, problems were solved with more cash and democracy faded to apathy as the population basked in their fools paradise. Politicians who made the best promises were elected. Business and politics merged and the regulatory and control functions of government ceased working. Suddenly the financial world woke up and realised that Greece was totally broke! Now things get interesting and hard, cost cutting and capital generating decisions have to be made. Government is now hated. Whose fault? The Greeks themselves. They failed to listen to and maintain democratic dialogue and now head for anarchy and the drachma! A lesson in what happens when democracy is not constantly tuned up; eventually reality catches up. There are lessons for all of us as ""weakness emerges from strength"". Peace and progress is easy with large majorities, lots of money and the sun shines! Take this away and the people change. Democracy is the safety valve, protest and dissent defuses and gives time for change. The people want peace and security but not to starve. Thus we should remember that political expression by oppositions may well upset the elite but when an HonMin criticises the APP for ""victimisation and intimidation"" referring to our democratic right to peaceful protest, like Egypt, he must remember it is our Constitutional right to protest peacefully! And sure political rhetoric does go overboard sometimes but I don't remember the same HonMin complaining when the use of hammers on certain groups was suggested! I object to corruption and poverty is solvable."171,Concord Times (Freetown),7/13/11,Anti-Corruption Commission Cautions SLRTA in Kenema [opinion],,SIERRA LEONE (94%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,18-Jul-11,,786  words,CORRUPTION (93%); VEHICLE TRAFFIC (90%); TALKS & MEETINGS (89%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (78%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (76%); THEATER & DRAMA (75%); THEATER COMPANIES (75%); INVESTIGATIONS (72%); IMMUNITY (72%); THEATER (70%); RADIO ADVERTISING (69%); MOTOR VEHICLES (54%); TELEVISION PROGRAMMING (50%) Sierra Leone; Corruption,"In the bid to address key corruption issues and to educate every public officer about corruption and its devastating effects, the Anti-Corruption Commission in Kenema engages government ministries, departments and agencies within the Eastern region.

He said as a commission they are taking every step necessary to address corruption and that people should remove the phobia or negative impression about the ACC by trying to create a positive one.

He said after the meeting, the commission will hold another session with all the stakeholders in the traffic sector in Kenema to address key corruption issues.

There is the need for a person to be adequately informed, if that person is to be recruited into the anti-corruption force, he said. Kamara gave a rundown of the main operational wings of the ACC, noting that two of these departments - the Public Education and External Outreach and the Systems and Processes Review Departments - are there to prevent corruption while the Intelligence Investigations and Prosecutions confronts corruption and corrupt public officers. He explained that a public officer is a person working for a public body whether paid or unpaid, and a public body is an institution established by an Act of Parliament, owned by government or where government has a percentage of shares. He added that even NGO workers are not immune from prosecution by the ACC as they too receive monies and properties for or on behalf of the people of Sierra Leone. Mr. Kamara said the commission prioritizes making converts rather than convicts, that is why in its public education drive the ACC uses community theatre, jingles and radio and TV drama spots and engages the print and electronic media extensively, to pass on the anti-corruption message. Explaining the offences and the procedures for reporting corrupt practices to the ACC, Public Education Officer, David Kanekey Conteh mentioned offering, soliciting or accepting advantage; influencing a public officer; corrupt acquisition of wealth; possession of unexplained wealth; and corrupting a public officer as offences punishable under the Anti-Corruption Act 2008. Public officers in the traffic sector who solicit and accept advantage these days go through a middle man to perpetuate such a crime, he observed and therefore warned all to desist from corrupt practices and stressed that the minimum penalty for every corruption offence is a fine not less than thirty million leones or three years imprisonment or both fine and imprisonment.

Augustin Nzindukiyimana, the deputy Ombudsman in charge of Preventing and fighting Corruption yesterday presented the report to delegates from the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) and United Nations Office of Drug Crimes (UNODC). The delegates are in the country to assess the implementation of the international anti-corruption instruments as requested by the convention. The same report indicates that 53.24 percent corruption cases were recorded in the local administration while 43.19 percent was registered in the justice sector during the same period. In public procurement, 28.12 percent cases were registered. Nzindukiyimana told the delegates that raising public awareness is one of the major strategies the Ombudsman's Office uses to prevent and fight against corruption and injustice. The UNCAC, the first legally binding international anti-corruption tool adopted by the UN General Assembly Resolution 58/4 of October 2003, obliges member states to implement a wide and detailed range of anti-corruption measures. However, the UN anti corruption body is currently evaluating two of its four major tools in the fight against corruption including criminalisation and international cooperation. Other tools are prevention and asset recovery. In a separate interview, Nzindukiyimana said that most of the tools were achieved in Rwanda. ""We did not achieve this to the maximum; there are some laws that need to be introduced,"" he noted. He outlined laws on international cooperation and investigating corruption as some of the acts that need to be introduced to further enhance the anti corruption campaign in the country. ""We cannot define the number of laws that should be introduced now, but after we get their (UNCAC) report, we will work on the required laws to be submitted to parliament for approval,"" he added. The delegates are also assessing the laws used in the anti corruption campaign. Nzindukiyimana, however, said that the Ombudsman office still face challenges such as limited staff to accomplish its mission coupled with limited powers. The efforts of the corruption watchdog's body are complemented by a national anti-corruption advisory council composed of the Office of the Ombudsman, National Public Prosecution Authority (NPPA), Supreme Court, National Police and the Ministry of Justice among others."174,The New Times (Kigali),7/18/11,Fighting Corruption in Local Gov't is Our Priority - Ombudsman,,RWANDA (94%); AUSTRIA (79%); CENTRAL EUROPE (52%),Newspaper,Bosco R.

Nzindukiyimana, who is in charge of preventing and fighting corruption disclosed this yesterday, in an interview. ""It is our priority to fight it at the local government level, and it is a priority of the government,"" Nzindukiyimana noted. He, however, explained that most forms of corruption in local government institutions are 'bureaucratic' related. The 2009-2010 Ombudsman report indicates that 53 percent of the corruption cases were recorded in the local administration. Unfair dismissal of employees, discrimination and unfair promotions at work places were ranked as the highest forms of corruption registered, and stood at 82.37 percent, according to the same report. ""Fighting corruption has no end, but we are doing it appropriately because we have the political will, which is lacking in many other countries. Our leaders prioritise, among others, fighting corruption, which is the most important tool in fighting the vice,"" he added. Increasing public awareness, Nzindukiyimana said, is one of the methods to be employed in the anti corruption drive. ""Rwandans should consider three things; to refuse, reject and report corruption. We want people to reject and report any form of corruption. But leaders at the grass-roots should also be active in this campaign,"" he stated. In a related development, Nzindukiyimana said that the final report on Rwanda's implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) instruments will be produced in a meeting to be held in Vienna, Austria in September. A delegation from UNCAC and United Nations Office of Drug Crimes (UNODC) was in the country, last week, to assess the implementation of the international anti-corruption instruments as requested by the convention such as criminalisation and international cooperation. It was the first time the international anti-corruption body assessed Rwanda's implementation process since it was adopted by the UN General Assembly Resolution 58/4 of October 2003 as the first legally binding international anti-corruption tool."175,Concord Times (Freetown),7/19/11,'Corruption is Responsible for High Unemployment' - Sluyag President,,SIERRA LEONE (94%),Newspaper,Ibrahim Tarawallie,ENGLISH,,,21-Jul-11,,399  words,UNEMPLOYMENT RATES (92%); JOB CREATION (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); EMPLOYMENT (90%); UNEMPLOYED PERSONS (90%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (89%); LABOR SECTOR PERFORMANCE (78%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (78%); APPRENTICESHIPS & INTERNSHIPS (77%); EMPLOYEE TRAINING (77%); TRENDS (76%); ACADEMIC STANDARDS (75%); SELF EMPLOYMENT (75%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (75%); EMPLOYMENT TRENDS (73%) Sierra Leone; Corruption; Labour,"President of the Sierra Leone Unemployed Youths Advocacy Group (SLUYAG) has stated that corruption and mismanagement were responsible for the high rate of unemployment in the country. Mohamed D. Sesay told participants at a job creation workshop for unemployed graduates organised by his group in collaboration with Africell that despite the effort of government and its partners, unemployment continues to be a great challenge. ""Corruption and mismanagement are responsible for the high rate of unemployment. Government should not focus on short-term strategy to address the issue,"" Sesay said. ""Many qualified students are still without jobs. We do not need experts from abroad to foster development in Sierra Leone, what we need is a conducive atmosphere for job creation."" He noted that the country's standard of education has fallen considerably as the university was busy producing more generals rather than specialists. He observed that most of the courses being taught at the university ""do not match with the modern trend in the job market"", while encouraging his colleagues to be pillars of development and not ones of destruction. He recommended that the government establishes a national youth service scheme and a safety net. National youth commissioner, Anthony Koroma noted that the potentials existed for youths to become managers, engineers and doctors, among others. He said youths should have personal ambition if they were serious about making it in life, adding, ""Unemployed graduates should reposition themselves and focus on innovative methods that promote self-employment."" Africell's corporate affairs officer, Joe Abass Bangura said investment made by the company has succeeded in creating some eight hundred direct and five thousand indirect employments for Sierra Leoneans. He noted that human investment through training of personnel in the practical application of knowledge gained in schools was priceless. ""No school can completely and adequately prepare one for the requirements of the workplace,"" he said. ""Africell wishes to announce the launching of its job training scheme for graduates. As a pilot project, we will provide an opportunity for three graduates to benefit from a three-month internship with us."" Bangura explained that after the three-month programme, candidates who meet the requirements will have the chance to be offered a full time job in the company."176,Concord Times (Freetown),7/19/11,ACC Schools BKPS Staff On Corruption,,SIERRA LEONE (93%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,21-Jul-11,,881  words,CORRUPTION (93%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (88%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); CIVIL SERVICES (78%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (73%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (69%); INVESTIGATIONS (66%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (64%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (63%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (60%); IMMIGRATION (50%) Sierra Leone; Corruption,"The Anti-Corruption Commission on Thursday 14th July 2011 continued their sensitization exercise by engaging workers of the Bo/Kenema Power Services (BKPS) office in Kenema. The meeting, which was chaired by Madam Francess M. Kpaka, Senior Personnel Clerk of the Bo-Kenema Power Services in Kenema, attracted over forty one workers. In her opening and welcome statement, Madam Kpaka said people had different notions about the ACC and that their presence at the BKPS will provide all the opportunity to get a clear understanding about corruption and the operations of the commission and called on all to be attentive so that all will benefit from the sensitization. Establishing the purpose for such engagement with BKPS, Mr. David Kanekey Conteh, Regional Public Education Officer of the ACC, intimated his audience that the BKPS was an essential service provider whose service was strategic to the development of that region. He said the ACC was seeking partnership with BKPS for national development, adding that the vision of the commission was to make Sierra Leone a corrupt free country where the socio-economic needs of its citizens would be met. This could not be achieved by the ACC alone, but by every Sierra Leonean, he said, noting that the ACC was at the BKPS not because they were corrupt but because public officers needed to be educated on corruption and the operations of the commission so that they will see the need to join the fight against corruption by becoming the ""eye"" of the commission. Giving the overview of the commission, the Kenema District Coordinator Mohamed Sylvanus Blake said at times people castigate the ACC because of the opinions or notions they habour about it and its operations. He categorized the operations of the commission in to two: Prevention and Confrontation. The public education and external outreach and the systems and processes review departments to prevent corruption by educating the public on the bad effects of corruption and the corresponding benefits of a corrupt free society and the examination of existing systems and structures which make room for corrupt practices to thrive and to recommend preventive measures. Blake mentioned that the commission has carried out reviews on the ministries of Health, Education Agriculture and Local Government, the Immigrations Department to name a few. The Intelligence, Investigation and Prosecution come in as the very last resort; to confront public officers who failed to heed the call and take personal interest above national interest. He said this has led to the prosecution and conviction of both high and low profile public servants. Speaking on the offences, the acting Regional Manager, Kenema, Peter Baio Kamara dilated on the limitations in the 2000 Act as having only nine corrupt practices, while the 2008 ACC Act contains twenty seven. He listed several corrupt practices that were punishable under the Anti-Corruption Act 2008 and called on workers of the BKPS to work within the ambit of the law, as it was quite dangerous for someone to circumvent the law. Mr. Kamara further said the penalties in the 2000 Act were such that many public officers treated the commission with levity. But the 2008 Act made the penalties very stiff, with a fine not less than thirty million leones or three years imprisonment or both fine and imprisonment depending on the opinion of the judge. The 2008 Act however makes provision for recoveries of monies misappropriated by public officers which are paid back into the consolidated fund. One such case was when the Commissioner of the ACC Joseph F. Kamara Esq. on the 13th May 2011 handed over a cheque of six hundred and eleven million, one hundred forty-one thousand Leones (Le611,141,000) and nine thousand four hundred and fifty US dollars ($9,450) to President Ernest Bai Koroma. He explained some of the offences in the ACC Act 2008 and the procedure for reporting corruption and how the report centre handles and processes complaints and reports from the public. He called on all to support the commission for the good of the nation. Responding, the Technical Director of BKPS, Munda M. Lewis, appreciated the ACC for putting them on their guard, as they have been educated about corruption, which will help them perform their duties more effectively as public officers. He said that was the most educative session he had ever had from the ACC, especially the area of the offences. He noted that he had been reading both the ACC Acts of 2000 and 2008 but the simple manner in which the offences were explained really opened his eyes to what they really meant. He alluded to the fact that the ordinary masses must not continue to suffer in silence but should be always ready to speak out against corruption, as it was the best service one can offer the nation. He also said that corruption was not only found among senior officers but there were junior personnel that have more access to state resources more than those at management level. He therefore advised every public officer to work carefully within the law so that they do not fall foul of the ACC Act 2008. He however appealed to the ACC to make available the Act and other ACC materials to public officers to serve as reminder. Questions and answers formed part of the programme."177,Concord Times (Freetown),7/21/11,ACC Takes Corruption Fight to MAFFs in Bo,,SIERRA LEONE (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,21-Jul-11,,822  words,TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (89%); AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS (78%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (78%); FOOD SECURITY (77%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (71%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (70%); MISAPPROPRIATION (60%) Sierra Leone; Corruption,"As part of its Public Education drive to all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), the Anti- Corruption Commission has on Tuesday 19th July 2011 held an institutional sensitization meeting with staff of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food Security (MAFFS), Bo District. The meeting which took place at the Ministry's District Head Quarters, China Farm Bo/Kenema Highway in Bo attracted over 300 staff members including, The District Agriculture Officer, Heads of Departments, and Extension Officers from the various duty stations in the District. The Anti-Corruption Commission District Coordinator for Bo District, Mr. Anthony Samu, while explaining the purpose of the meeting, said that the meeting is not for any mishap done by the Ministry, but just one of the periodic and many sensitization meetings organized with Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). Mr. Samu reiterated that the ACC realizes the fact to come closer to the people in order to allay their fears and misconceptions concerning the ACC. Availability, Accessibility and Affordability of food are key issues the Ministry is taking the lead to address, and that we should all make our own input or contribution towards this drive Samu maintained. He also said that the meeting will give staff of the Ministry the opportunity to advance questions or raise issues and concerns regarding the operations of the Commission. Mr. Samu therefore encouraged the participants to be open and frank in the deliberations. Giving an overview of the Commission and update, Mr. Patrick Sandi the Regional Manager-South, on behalf of the Commissioner of the Anti-Corruption Commission, expressed his gratitude for the strides made by the Ministry to addressing the food self-sufficiency and security issue. He underscored the fact that the MAFFS like the Health and Education Ministries is very strategic to the State in addressing the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) and the Government's ""Agenda for Change"" programme. He therefore solicited the support and collaboration of all in the Ministry to get onboard and do the right thing since corruption is dynamic and fights back when it is being fought against. Mr. Sandi went ahead to talk about the establishment of the ACC and what the Commission does which he said include, Education, Prevention and Confrontation. He informed the audience that the 2000 Act was reviewed in 2008 which gave the Commission more powers including additional offences above 27 in number. These offences include, 'possession of unexplained wealth"", ""bid rigging"" and ""misappropriation of public and donor funds & property"" among others, and goes with stiff penalty when convicted.  He also talked about Declaration of Assets and Liabilities, which according to him, demonstrate how accountable and transparent Public Officers are in public life. Declaring your Assets as a Public Officer Mr. Sandi emphasized will protect and guide you in the event of future problems. Provision in the Anti-Corruption Act 2008, regarding a person failing to declare his/her assets and liabilities shall be  on conviction to pay a fine of not less than twenty million leones or one year jail term or both fine and jail term. Mr. Sandi also informed the MAFFS staff that the ACC has signed a Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) with the UK Government for assistance to be provided to the ACC by the UK Government as and when the Commission needs it and that Sierra Leone has ratified the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) whereby Sierra Leone can solicit other states for assistance. He appealed and encouraged all partners to work together to get things right to move the country forward bearing in mind that the Judiciary is also independent. In his statement on behalf of the MAFFS, Mr. Michael Bockarie of the Private and Rural Sector programme acknowledged that ACC cannot work in isolation and therefore need the support and collaboration of other partners to move the fight forward. He reaffirmed to the Commission that as a Ministry and strategic player to the fight, they are always ready to supply the ACC with all valuable information required. Earlier, the District Agriculture Officer, Bo District, Mr. Mohamed Bah in welcoming the ACC team and his staff registered greetings to the ACC on behalf of the MAFFS. He reiterated that the relationship between the ACC and the Ministry should be cordial as the two institutions are partners in development. Mr. Bah underscored that the ACC is not witch hunting anybody but that wants things to be done right as it is the more reason why the Commission was established. Mr. Bah concluded by saying that we should do things or behave in a way that we feel confident and safe with no fear of falling foul of the ACC Laws. Interactive questions, answers and concerns session formed part of the programme. The vote of thanks was given by a staff of the Ministry, Madam Mary Mammy."178,Concord Times (Freetown),7/26/11,"ACC, Mest Join Hands in Corruption Fight in Bo",,SIERRA LEONE (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,26-Jul-11,,622  words,CORRUPTION (95%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (90%); TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (90%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (89%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (89%); CHILDREN (78%); SOCIAL JUSTICE (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (77%); WAGES & SALARIES (73%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (72%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (70%); IMMIGRATION (50%) Sierra Leone; Corruption,"As part of its fight against corruption campaign, the Anti- Corruption Commission (ACC) has met with staff of the Ministry of Education Science and Technology (MEST) in Bo District at its Baiima Road office.

ACC District Coordinator for Bo District, Mr. Anthony Samu informed the Deputy Director of MEST, Bo District and his staff that, in allaying their fears, the ACC is just at the ministry for a face-to-face discussion and interaction, and not for any alleged corruption related activity by the ministry. ""We want to come closer to our partners and other stakeholders if we need to succeed in the fight against corruption,"" Mr. Samu emphasized. The meeting is one of the normal and routine engagements with institutions that the ACC makes through the many public education drive in the fight against corruption. ""Education is paramount to the heart of Government and the people of this country and as such, we should all protect and promote the educational pursuit of our children, especially regarding the illegal school charges levied by some schools authorities on parents,"" Mr. Samu concluded. On the Commission's activities and update, Mr. Patrick Sandi the Regional Manager-South, on behalf of the Commissioner of the ACC informed the ministry staff on the approaches the ACC uses in fighting corruption, which he said, includes education, prevention, prosecution and the National Anti-Corruption Strategy. Mr. Sandi touched on the Act 2008 which replaced the Act 2000 and the related offences with the corresponding penalty for each. Declaration of assets and liabilities, he went on, is obligatory for all public officers as this demonstrate transparency. The ills of corruption are many, but mentioning a few, Mr. Sandi talked about social inequality, poor service delivery system and poor educational system which undermine the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG), Agenda for Change and the Girl Child Education. Since education is vital, issues that have been raised from the public include; Fee subsidy utilization by school authorities, handling of unclaimed salaries, strict monitoring of schools and the observance of the code of conduct for teachers. As he went on, Mr. Sandi informed the audience that the Commission had made tremendous strides regarding its operations and these include; the conviction of two Government Ministers and others, reviews done in some institutions like, Education, Health, Agriculture and the production of Service Charters for organizations like, Immigration, SLRTA etc. Earlier in welcoming the visiting ACC staff, The Deputy Director of Education, Bo District, Mr. John Amara Swarray who also chaired the meeting said that it was a very good idea to have the ACC for such interactive session. Mr. Swarray reiterated that they as teachers are always ready to learn, and that the meeting is a learning opportunity for not only them in the Ministry but for the ACC as well. Making statement on behalf of the MEST, Mr. Swarray underscored that the success of Sierra Leone lies with the ACC. He further emphasized that the ACC has been established to see that things are done correctly and efficiently. Mr. Swarray however intimated the ACC team that some oversight bodies like journalists are somehow disturbing the education system for they enter into schools without reference to the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, and not even with proper identification. Issues and concerns were raised by staff at the end of meeting."179,Concord Times (Freetown),7/29/11,"NFF, ACC Collaborate to Fight Corruption",,SIERRA LEONE (79%),Newspaper,Anthony B.

The meeting which was held on Wednesday 27th July 2011 attracted over (20) twenty staff members including; the Deputy Commandant - South, fire fighter operators and other administrative and support staff. When Speaking to the NFF staff members regarding the visit of the ACC, Mr. Anthony Samu, the District Coordinator for the Anti corruption Commission, Bo District, tried to allay the fears of his audience stating that their visit at NFF is routine in meeting with Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), sensitizing them on the establishment of the Commission, evils of corruption, the corruption offences and penalties as contained in the 2008 Anti-Corruption Act. Mr. Samu also talked about the commitment and public relations aspect required of Fire Force workers. He underscored the fact that the Commission needs to come closer to its partners and the wider community, and that it is even the more reason why the ACC is having the meeting in a bid to have a face-to-face discussion and soliciting the support of the NFF. The engagement Mr. Samu further explained was part of the Commission's public education and preventive approach in the fight against corruption and he therefore encouraged the audience to be frank, open, raise issues, concerns, and ask as many questions as possible during the meeting for this is an opportunity for them in learning more about the Commission and its operations. Addressing the NFF staff, Mr. Patrick Sandi, the ACC Regional Manager - South reiterated that the NFF Deputy Commandant - South, Mr. Albert Parker had long expressed his desire for the Commission to address the NFF staff. Mr. Sandi hastened to say that the ACC is not for witch hunt or used to bring people down. ACC, he continued, is an independent institution established by an Act of Parliament in 2000. The 2008 Act gives more powers and has helped the Commission, as it can now prosecute its own cases without reference to the Attorney General's Office. Sandi informed staff that the Commission has the mandate to investigate all forms of corruption, no matter the amount of money or individual involved in it, and these has been demonstrated in the past as records show. Mr. Sandi also explained the various offences which are common in public institutions like; ""possession of unexplained wealth"", ""misappropriation of public funds, revenue & property"", ""protection of public revenue, property"", etc. and that the area of procurement is a serious avenue for corruption to take place. He emphasized that the punishment for such offences is a fine of not less than thirty (30) million Leones or imprisoned for not less than three (3) years or both fine and prison term. According to Mr. Sandi, the Act 2008 also makes provision for the declaration of assets and liabilities. Asset Declaration he went on is making public officers accountable in public life besides the protection it provides should one face or encounter corruption accusation in the future. Concluding, Mr. Sandi encouraged all to avoid the culture of silence, and therefore report all corruption related activities. He hastened to talk on the low motivation of public officers for their work and services which to some extent undermines the work of the Commission, but that the Commission continues to advocate for better conditions of service for public workers. We should all improve on our moral stature and with the support of all we shall win or succeed in the fight Sandi maintained. Contributing, District Coordinator, Anthony Samu cautioned the NFF staff to be careful regarding their public relations during their outdoor activities. He advised the officers to resist and reject corruption when attempts are made to them by the public. The offence of soliciting and accepting will catch up with them if they are manipulated by the public to doing the wrong things contrary to what is prescribed ""not to do"" in the Act 2008. He also talked about their commitment to work in nation building. Welcoming the ACC visiting team earlier on, Mr. Alimamy Conteh, NFF Sub Officer - South who also chaired the meeting, underscored that the ACC is not witch hunting anybody or institution, but that the ACC's presence will send the message to all for change of behavior and attitude for the betterment of Sierra Leone. Mr. Conteh emphasized that as public officers, we need to be checked with regards our behavior and attitude especially when we are care takers of fire hazards in the Southern region and the country as a whole. He implored his staff to listen keenly to the message the ACC have for them as such engagement will go a long way to minimize corruption at public institutions. Questions and answers, suggestions and comments formed part of the meeting while Mr. Bockarie Saffa gave the vote of thanks."180,The New Times (Kigali),7/29/11,We Cannot Afford to Relent On Corruption [editorial],,RWANDA (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,29-Jul-11,,237  words,CORRUPTION (92%); EMBEZZLEMENT (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (78%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (73%) Rwanda; Corruption,"This week, the National Public Prosecution Authority (NPPA), released  a report on investigations carried out based on the 2007 Auditor  General's (AG) report, which indicated that over Rwf 3.7 billion was  embezzled. Twenty six of the investigated cases, involving the loss of over Rwf125.3m and implicating 66 officials, have been forwarded to court for prosecution. In total, about 223 officials from various levels of government have so far been prosecuted. The Office of the Prosecutor General deserves commendation and support from all stakeholders for the great work it is doing to ensure accountability by government officials. As a country characterized by zero tolerance to corruption, we ought to devise better and permanent mechanisms that will help check graft. However, fighting corruption requires collective effort. All government officials have within their mandate a duty to fight corruption and protect public resources. Several AG's reports have highlighted cases of illegal tendering and embezzlement. Some institutions divert funds for activities that they were not originally budgeted for. While there is general improvement in the management of public funds, some irregularities still persist. Now that prosecution carried out investigations, they should go all the way and bring all the culprits to book.

Financed by the World Bank (WB), the survey is to be conducted by a Tanzanian-based American company, called Kilimanjaro International Cooperation. The FEAC had invited prospective local and international consultants to conduct the survey three years ago. ""The stringent evaluation process of the commission and WB has taken time,"" Fanosea Hussein, project manager at the FEAC, told Fortune. Out of 20 international and local companies who submitted their proposal, only five companies passed the technical requirements, and were shortlisted for the financial proposal, including Ernst & Young. The technical evaluation included previous experience of the company, methodology, number and competency of the professionals involved, number of data collectors, and familiarity to African governance, specifically Ethiopia. While the financial evaluation is based on determining which candidate can offer the lowest consulting cost. After three years of evaluation, the FEAC awarded the contract to a Tanzanian based company which was founded and established by Greyson Kiondo in 1997. The company is engaged in sector specific capacity building in policy and regulation. The Institute of Educational Research of Addis Abeba University (AAU) had been contracted to conduct the first national survey in April 2001, commissioned by the ethics sub programme of the Civil Service Reform Programme before the commission was established in May 2001. The project was financed by the Ethiopian government and United Nation Development Programme (UNDP). ""The new survey is to investigate how institutions perceive the state of corruption in Ethiopia, and will manifest the situation on the ground,"" Fanosea anticipated. The survey is to be conducted in households, among businesses, government institutions, government developmental institutions, religious institutions and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), according to FEAC. Around 7,000 individuals are expected to be surveyed from all regions, including Addis Abeba and Dire Dawa. For such purposes, the questionnaires are to be prepared in five different languages including, Amharic, Oromifa, Tigrigna, Afarigna and Somali. The AAU's Institute of Educational Research (IER), in the previous survey, had surveyed public officials, household heads, and business entrepreneurs as sources of data in all nine regions. ""The survey is very important in gauging the current level of corruption, in order for the commission to react accordingly, and will be an input for policy making,"" according to a project manager. In the past 10 years, the country has gone through different changes and we need to know the status of the country, he added. The IER survey noted that the country has demonstrated not only the prevalence of corruption, but also the severity. The most intensive corruption rate is observed in places where financial transactions are carried out in the allocation of scarce resources, such as land, and where contracts are enforced, particularly in courts of law, according to the first survey. Employment in government offices is also dependent on political affiliation, or loyalty, rather than skill and merit. Accordingly, institutions that are singled out to be highly corrupt and inefficient by households and business entrepreneurs included the then Customs Authority, the Inland Authority Administration, and the police, including traffic police and all utility service institutions. On the other hand, the former Security, Immigration and Refugee Affairs Authority was given low corruption ratings. Ethiopia is ranked 116 out of 176 countries with the index of 2.7 out of 10 in 2010 (meaning that 60 countries are struggling with more serious corruption issues), according to Transparency International. Transparency International is a non-governmental organisation that monitors and publicises corporate and political corruption in international development. It publishes annual Corruption Perceptions Indices, a comparative listing of corruption worldwide."183,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),8/1/11,Corruption Cases Reduce - ACC,,ZAMBIA (92%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,1-Aug-11,,386  words,CORRUPTION (96%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (90%); INTERVIEWS (90%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (78%); CUSTOMER SERVICE (70%); WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION (67%); IMMIGRATION (55%) Zambia; Corruption,"THE Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has said corruption cases have reduced due to the introduction of internal mechanisms in organisations that prevent corruption. Chief communication education officer, Festus Chipungu said in an interview at the on-going Agriculture and Commercial Show that the integrity committee had been introduced in Government organisations, agencies and private companies to monitor operations. This year's Agriculture and Commercial Show is carried under the theme, 'Shaping tomorrow's world.' Mr Chipungu said reforms such as customer service had also been set up in some organisations and had worked very well in fighting corruption in the immigration department, Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) and the Ministry of Lands. He said reforms had worked in the fight against corruption because they prevented individuals from having too much power over the clients and improved accountability and transparency. ""We have set up about 15 integrity committees in more than 15 organisations such as the Government, agencies and private companies,"" he said. He said the introduction of the Whistle-blowers Act under the Public Interest Disclosure number four of 2010 would encourage more people to report corrupt cases to the ACC. He said efforts had also been made to widely publicise the existence of the law through the electronic adverts, information materials and lectures. ""The integrity committee that started two years ago has proved to be a success in the fight against corruption in organisations,"" he said. Mr Chipungu further said ACC had engaged civil society organisations to supplement its efforts in fighting corruption through educating the public.He called on the public to take the fight against corruption seriously and treat those corrupt as thieves because the act took away resources, which was tantamount to stealing. He urged the public to take advantage of different materials published in all the seven major local languages on corruption so that they could fully understand its dangers to the economy. ""People do not fully understand the effects of corruption. It results in lack of proper housing, no enough education and diverting of resources meant for development to private purposes. About 140 corrupt cases were reported to the ACC last year and were mostly from individuals."184,The Namibian (Windhoek),8/4/11,"Roads Authority, ACC Sign Agreement to Fight Corruption",,NAMIBIA (91%),Newspaper,Nico Smit,ENGLISH,,,8-Aug-11,,419  words,CORRUPTION (96%); AGREEMENTS (91%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (89%); EXECUTIVES (76%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (74%); PUBLIC POLICY (64%); DRIVERS LICENSES (53%) Namibia; Corruption; Transport and Shipping,"THE Roads Authority (RA) has stepped up its efforts in the fight against corruption by signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) allowing it unrestricted access to the RA's systems and information database. Speaking at the signing ceremony, ACC director Paulus Noa said the MoU marks a ""remarkable milestone in our quest to cement an already existing good working relationship between the two institutions"". Noa said the agreement would facilitate cooperation between the RA and the ACC and would ensure that the two institutions would render more assistance to each other in investigations into corruption and fraud. Noa added the agreement would facilitate easy access for the ACC to the data kept within various departments at the RA, and ""it would certainly help the commission to expedite the investigation when allegations of corrupt practices in either the registration of vehicles or the issuance of driver's licences are reported to the commission. According to the ACC Director, the memorandum would also help the RA in carrying out its own investigations, as it would also make it easier for the RA to obtain information from the ACC. ""All institutions need to strengthen their integrity systems and this would lead to a decline in corruption and fraud in Namibia,"" Noa said. Also present at the signing ceremony was RA Acting Chief Executive Officer Conrad Lutombi, who said that due to the nature of its work, the RA has dealt with a number of corruption related cases in the past. To address the situation, the RA strengthened its internal policies and launched an independent anti-corruption hotline in November 2008. Lutombi said the signing of the MoU represents a ""bold initiative"" in the fight against corruption, fraud and workplace dishonesty. The RA acting CEO said that the MoU ""confirms the relationship between the RA and ACC in terms of mutual cooperation, support and rendering assistance, it also serves to strengthen and formalise a good working relationship between the RA and ACC."" Lutombi added that improvements in service delivery can be expected through the initiative. He added that while there was no national policy on whistle-blowing as yet, the RA had drafted a whistle-blowing policy as part of its fight against corruption. When asked whether the RA and ACC would be working together to strengthen internal policies to close loopholes which allow for corruption, Lutombi said that the RA would be working with the ACC to root out corruption."185,The New Times (Kigali),8/4/11,TR to Launch Gender Based Corruption Report,,RWANDA (91%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,4-Aug-11,,234  words,CORRUPTION (92%); GENDER & SEX DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT (90%); GENDER EQUALITY (90%); WOMEN (90%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (77%); POLLS & SURVEYS (72%); HUMAN RESOURCES (67%) Rwanda; Women and Gender; Corruption; Human Rights,"Transparency Rwanda (TR) will next week launch a report on Gender Based corruption at work places in the country.

TR is a non-governmental non-profit organisation whose objective is to fight against corruption and related offences. ""The report which covered the whole country and used both quantitative and qualitative methods unveils the prevalence of this form of corruption, the sectors where it is most relevant and the categories of citizens most at risk,"" she stated. Ingabire said that, the study explored the performance and usage of the strategies and mechanisms designed to report and prevent cases of gender-based corruption cases at work places. She stated that the launch would be an opportunity for key institutions engaged in the fight against corruption and promotion of gender equality to explore potential synergies and reflect on how to deepen their actions. The report also highlights causes and consequences of this form of corruption as well as aspects of human resources management most exposed to abuse. The study, which is the first of its kind in Rwanda, highlights concerns on corruption despite government's efforts to fight against graft and the promotion of gender equality."186,The Informer (Monrovia),8/8/11,Hunted By Past Deeds -Edith Gongloe Weh in Corruption Web,,LIBERIA (92%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,9-Aug-11,"MONROVIA, LIBERIA (79%)",638  words,CORRUPTION (90%); HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS (76%); TEXT MESSAGING (70%); WRITERS (69%) Liberia; Corruption,"Nimba County former Superintended and senatorial aspirant Edith Gongloe Weh is being hunted by her past deeds of reportedly chopping monies intended for the people of Kwedin Township in the county. Reports gathered by this paper revealed that the former superintendent failed to deliver an amount of over US$2,500 donated by the office of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf for the people of the township, but the amount never reach its destination. Meanwhile the Nimba County junior senatorial aspirant has failed to respond to the allegation after several calls and text messages, though the Office of the President has confirmed the saga. The information reached The Informer a week after this paper carried a front headline story captioned: 'Protest Vote Plotted against Ellen in Nimba"", in which the citizens of Kwedin Township said they have planned not to vote for President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf for the second time because according to them she has failed to fulfill campaign promises made to them. Some citizens of the area informed this paper that President Sirleaf, through the office of the Assistant Minister of State for Logistic, Varney Sirleaf, made available over US$2,500 to the former Nimba Superintendent as ""initial contribution"" to the construction of the Kwedin Guest House project, but the citizens claimed that said amount was never delivered to them by Madam Weh. According the citizens' spokesman Roger Matadi, during an honoring program they organized for President Sirleaf early this year, at which the Liberian leader was represented by Madam Weh, they received from Madam Weh US$280. Of the amount, Madam Weh gave US$200 on behalf of the President and Varney Sirleaf and US$80 on behalf of herself, he alleged. He explained that they got to know that the President sent more than the amount that reached them when a representative group of the citizens later came to Monrovia to officially gown President Sirleaf and Varney Sirleaf. During the program, he narrated, they thanked the Office of the President for the US$200 sent to them earlier through Superintendent Weh. He said this commendation brought about shock and surprise to Varney who had reportedly given over US$2,500 and two set of jersey to madam Weh. Since last Thursday, this paper has made several efforts in getting Madam Weh's side of the story, but she has failed to comment, despite making promises to call back. When called for the first time on Thursday morning, Madam Weh said, ""...I am in meeting, please called me at 2:30."" Called at 2:30, as she requested, her phone was switched off. Called, again, on Friday morning, after this writer had sent her two text messages about the citizens' claim, Madam Weh, again, responded that ""I am in a meeting, but I will call you back when finish."" She failed to call or respond up to press time. However, when contacted, the Assistant Minister of State for Logistic, Varney Sirleaf, confirmed the citizens' allegation but said it had since been laid to rest. Mr. Sirleaf, who also rejected being interview on the matter, said he does not want to be seen as the one causing hindrance to anyone's political ambition. According to him, the leaders of the Kwedin citizens raised the issue and it was settled. ""I even gave them (leaders) US$500 at the time they visited me in my office,"" Mr. Sirleaf added. He wondered why the problem that was dealt with ever since has to surface at this time. ""May be it is the same leaders that are bringing this thing out,"" Sirleaf noted. President Sirleaf last month relieved Madam Gongloe-Weh of her post as superintendent of Nimba ""to enable her to pursue her political objectives."" The President's decision is in keeping with her decision that all political appointees vying for electoral office must step down,"" Presidential Press Secretary Cyrus Wleh Badio stated."187,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),8/8/11,PF Adoption Marred By Corruption -- Lifwekelo,,ZAMBIA (94%); FINLAND (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,8-Aug-11,"LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (90%)",733  words,EXECUTIVES (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (90%); TALKS & MEETINGS (79%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (78%); POLITICS (78%); DISORDERLY CONDUCT (77%); MENTAL ILLNESS (72%); INTELLIGENCE & COGNITION (67%); HOTELS & MOTELS (50%) Zambia; Corruption,"FORUM for Leadership Search executive director Edwin Lifwekelo has said it is obvious that the adoption of candidates by the Patriotic Front (PF) is embroiled in corruption by the party leadership. Mr Lifwekelo said there were allegations that Copperbelt and Lusaka parliamentary seats were fetching as much as K100 million, adding that it was a clear indication that democracy in PF had been subverte and mutilated by Mr Sata. And Mr Lifwekelo has disclosed that his organisation has information that a meeting took lace at the Finnish Embassy where donors expressed disgust at the PF/Post alliance. He alleged that at the meeting, Post editor Fred M'membe failed to justify his alliance with the PF and the same was described by the donors as unprofessional. Mr Lifwekelo said the donors further expressed unhappiness with M'membe's willingness to turn the newspaper into a PF propaganda machinery. Meanwhile, Committee of Citizens executive director Gregory Chifire has called on relevant authorities to establish a commission of inquiry to ascertain Mr Sata's full mental capacity. Mr Chifire said it was in the interest of the nation and that of Mr Sata that an inquiry be stablished going by a number of things that Mr Sata had been doing which were not in onformity with the behaviour of a would-be republican president. He said this at a Press briefing held at Courtyard Hotel in Lusaka yesterday. Mr Chifire said his organisation had been compelled to furnish information in accordance with the provisions of the Mental Disorder Act Chapter 305 of the Laws of Zambia to relevant authorities for the possible establishment of an inquiry into the irregular conduct which was akin to mental disorderly conduct. He alleged that Mr Sata's conduct had not only been highly disorderly, irregular and sad but it seemed to suggest that his mental comprehension was not as it should be. Mr Chifire said Mr Sata's conduct could seriously be classified under the provisions and ambit of the law, in particular the Mental Disorder Act, adding that his organisation had found it fit to classify Mr Sata as an individual well within the provisions of Section 5 of the said Act, in particular Class I and II under the Act. He said although he was not an expert in the medical profession but merely a law-abiding citizen who believed in the laws the of Zambia, he had an obligation to point out matters of nation interest such as Mr Sata's conduct that Zambians had since sadly become ccustomed to through Mr Sata's conduct. Mr Chifire said the Act clearly gives members of the public the liberty to enforce what could be termed in lay mans language as a 'citizen arrest' for purposes of ensuring that mental isorderly conduct was gagged. He said establishing of an inquiry was a safer and more dignified route that his organisation was seeking because Mr Sata had constantly displayed conduct to the general public. Mr Chifire said his organisation would rely on well-documented conduct exhibited by Mr Sata on different occasions such as the November 1, 2008 issue where Mr Sata astonished the whole nation when he allegedly went on rampage hurling insults towards international and locally accredited journalists having lost the 2008 presidential elections. Mr Chifire said the other incident was Mr Sata's alleged unwavering support for gay rights in Zambia and his unpalatable verbal rampage on August 3 this year at a meeting called by the ECZ for presidential aspirants and also the calling of a freelance journalist, Chanda Chimba II as a hyena when he was a human being. He said that the information provided in this regard was not with malice or prejudice but was advanced purely in national interest and especially to safe guard Mr Sata's personal interest and of those around him. Mr Chifire said his organisation would soon be filing an affidavit before the courts on the request for the establishment of an inquiry. But PF vice-president Guy Scott has challenged Mr Chifire to have his mental status examined before he called on Mr Sata's mental status to be examined. Mr Scott said in an interview in Lusaka yesterday that Mr Chifire should ascertain his mental ability first and see whether he was mentally fit. ""That is nonsense! He should first have his mental status examined before he requests for Mr Sata's mental status to be examined. Let him do it first and show us how it can be done,"" Dr Scott said."188,Concord Times (Freetown),8/9/11,ACC Takes Corruption Fight to Nurses,,SIERRA LEONE (92%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,11-Aug-11,,576  words,CORRUPTION (95%); NURSES & NURSING (94%); TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); MEDICAL EDUCATION (90%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (90%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (90%); GRADUATE & PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS (78%); MIDWIVES (77%); INVESTIGATIONS (74%); PRISONS (69%); CRIMINAL FINES (69%) Sierra Leone; Corruption; Health and Medicine,"The Northern Regional office of Anti-Corruption Commission has taken the educational approach in the fight against corruption to student nurses in Makeni. This was in the form of a sensitization meeting with staff and students of the National School of Nursing and School of Midwifery at the Masuba campus in Makeni on Friday 5th August 2011. Explaining the rationale for the meeting, the ACC District Coordinator, Bombali district Raymond Alieu Kamara said it was meant to encourage them to partner with the Commission in the fight against corruption. He said the meeting was also aimed at educating the nurses on the dangers of corruption, operations of the Commission and how corrupt practices can hinder the improvement of health delivery system in Sierra Leone. He stressed that the fight against corruption was a fight for all and should not just be left in the hands of the Commission alone. Kamara therefore entreated all present to see the fight against corruption as a collective responsibility which requires coalition building and partnership. Giving an overview of the Commission, Public Education Officer, Al-Hassan Sesay explained the three approaches used by the ACC in the fight against corruption, which are public education, prevention and confrontation. He explained the prosecutorial powers and mandate of the Commission as enshrined in the 2008 Anti-Corruption Act. Mr. Sesay made it clear to staff and students of the Nursing School and School of Midwifery that the Commission was not witch-hunting anybody and not just there to arrest and convict corrupt individuals, but also sensitizing the public on the dangers of corruption. Explaining the offences, Public Education Officer, Mrs. Fatmata Finda Bangura stressed that the Commission has the mandate to investigate all forms of corruption and corrupt practices. She highlighted some of the offences in the 2008 Act and disclosed that the punishment for any of the offences was a fine of not less than thirty (30) million Leones or imprisonment for not less than three (3) years or both fine and prison term. She used the opportunity to warn all staff and students to stop receiving gifts for corrupt purposes. She emphasized that Section 47 of the Anti-Corruption Act 2008 clearly makes it an offence for any public officer who solicits or accepts gifts as an inducement in the performance of his/her official duties. Mrs. Bangura explained the various methods of making reports to the Commission and entreated the student to resist, reject and report corruption. She reminded them of their civic responsibility to report corrupt practices going on in their respective institutions. She emphasized the Commission's core values of confidentiality and fullest protection for informants. Mrs. Bangura read the free ACC mobile hotlines and explained to them the benefits of making report and the 10% reward to informers for reporting corruption acts to the Commission. She however warned them against making false report which she said was an offence. Delivering the vote of thanks on behalf of staff and students, one of the midwifery students, Mrs. Marie Theresa Sheriff thanked the ACC for enlightening them on the offences and what they should not do. She assured the Commission that they would abide by the warnings and appealed to the Commission to address their numerous concerns and take the message to the government. Questions, answers, comments and concerns formed part of the meeting."189,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),8/12/11,'Anti-Corruption Commission Won't Probe ECZ',,ZAMBIA (92%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,14-Aug-11,"LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (88%)",389  words,CORRUPTION (93%); ELECTIONS (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); ELECTION AUTHORITIES (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); PRINTING INDUSTRY (90%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (78%); BALLOTS (78%); POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS (77%); POLITICAL PARTIES (73%); POLITICS (73%) Zambia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has said it is not carrying out any investigations into alleged corrupt practices by the Electoral Commission of Zambia (ECZ) over a printing company it engaged to print ballot papers for the 2011 general elections. In a statement released in Lusaka yesterday, ACC director-general Godfrey Kayukwa said there were no investigations concerning ECZ or any of its suppliers, including Universal Printing Group of South Africa. ""Recently, there have been statements and reports in the media in relation to generalised allegations of corruption at the ECZ in the public interest and as director of ACC I have decided to provide some clarity on this matter. ""The ACC wishes to state that there is no investigation concerning the ECZ or any of its suppliers,"" he said. Mr Kayukwa, however, said the institution was investigating an allegation of corruption against a former ECZ employee, Mpundu Mfula on a matter unrelated to the printing of ballot papers. He said the allegations against Mr Mfula were made in 2007 by an individual. ""It was, however, not possible to progress the investigations into this allegation due to the fact that Mr Mfula left the country and his whereabouts are not known since April this year. ""The commission recorded a warn-and-caution statement from him in April itself. As this is an on-going investigation, the commission is constrained from releasing any details at this stage as this would prejudice the investigation and the rights of Mr Mfula,"" Mr Kayukwa said. Meanwhile, ECZ said it was dismayed by the manner in which Patriotic Front member Given Lubinda delivered a letter to the office of the chairperson of the commission. ECZ public relations manager Cris Akufuna said in a statement last evening that Mr Lubinda was in the company of other people and a cameraman who, without permission, took pictures in the chairperson's office and the reception. ""The commission would like to warn political parties and their members that the commission will not entertain such behaviour and will not hesitate to take drastic action against any individual who deliberately puts to risk the security of the commission. ""The mandate of the commission is to conduct elections and it will not be distracted by any intimidatory and cowardly acts from any individual or party,"" Mr Akufuna said."190,Concord Times (Freetown),8/15/11,No Immunity On Corruption- ERSG Schulenburg,,SIERRA LEONE (97%); SWITZERLAND (79%),Newspaper,Mohamed Massaquoi,ENGLISH,,,18-Aug-11,,439  words,CORRUPTION (93%); DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY (90%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (90%); HUMAN RIGHTS (90%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (90%); PEACE PROCESS (90%); IMMUNITY (90%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (89%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (78%); HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS (78%); INTERNATIONAL LAW (78%); RULE OF LAW (77%); TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (75%); CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES CRIME (72%); CIVIL SERVICES (70%); TERRITORIAL & NATIONAL BORDERS (65%); ILLEGAL DRUGS (64%); DRUG TRAFFICKING (50%) Sierra Leone; Corruption,"The Executive Representative of the Secretary General (ERSG) in Sierra Leone has said that being head of the United Nations Peace-building Office in Sierra Leone (UNIPSIL) and having diplomatic immunity does not mean he was above the laws of the country and therefore could not be prosecuted for corruption.

Ngozu was arrested in December 2009 after she was accused of subletting her Government home in Swakopmund to more than 20 people, which is a contravention under the Anti-Corruption Act. Under the act, it was charged that Ngozu (a public officer), allegedly used her position to obtain gratification from members of the public by renting the rooms between 2005 and 2009 of a Government house allocated to her. After an investigation followed by an arrest by the local Police, it came to light that Ngozu had rented out the four bedrooms, the living room, the garage and an outside room for N$400 per month per room. Entire families were apparently living in some rooms. Up to 23 people were living there. She was granted bail of N$2 000 then, and the occupants of the house were ordered to vacate the home immediately and find other accommodation. Lana Fouche, who represented Ngozu, argued that the Police were not authorised to conduct and execute search warrants in terms of the Anti Corruption Act, and that the whole search at the house and the arrests were outside the scope of the Police as they were not appointed as investigators under the Act and that they were not part of ACC. In the matter with Ngozu, the Police obtained a search warrant under the Criminal Procedure Act, to search for illegal immigrants, but ended up with a graft investigation. In terms of the Anti-Corruption Act, it is only authorised officer (under specific definitions) who can arrest, investigate and execute search warrants for graft related charges. In his verdict, Tjatjara stated that it was clear that the Police had to be authorised by the ACC, and that the Namibian Police are not recognised as investigative officers or special investigating officers under the corruption law, as they are not appointed by the ACC Director. He also stated that the Police ""do not blend in"" as investigative officers or authorised officers for graft charges. ""It follows that the whole investigation and search related to the case for which the accused was charged under the Act was not within the powers of the Namibian Police, thus ultra vires and illegal,"" the Magistrate said."193,The Namibian (Windhoek),8/17/11,Magistrate Charged With Corruption,,NAMIBIA (95%),Newspaper,Paulus Ashipala,ENGLISH,,,19-Aug-11,,177  words,CORRUPTION (93%); MAGISTRATES (92%); BRIBERY (90%); EXTORTION (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (88%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (88%); BAIL (88%); ARRESTS (88%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"A young Oshakati-based Magistrate, Melaney Theron, was arrested on Monday on charges of corruption, extortion and bribery.

Mr Nchito, Mr Lubinda and Mr M'membe have come under fire for failing to provide evidence of their allegations against UPG when they were summoned by the ACC on Thursday last week."196,Concord Times (Freetown),8/24/11,Corruption Crusade Reaches Burma III,,SIERRA LEONE (79%),Newspaper,Mohamed Sylvanus Blake,ENGLISH,,,25-Aug-11,,632  words,TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (90%); PUBLIC SCHOOLS (89%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (73%); WITNESSES (60%) Sierra Leone; Corruption,"The robust and sustained public education crusade by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) in the eastern province of the country has been ongoing in pursuit of one of its mandates of employing all necessary measures to curb corruption, through public education and outreach sessions which has seen the commission meeting with various MDAs and communities in and around Kenema aimed at raising their awareness on corruption and the operations of the ACC. Burma III community, in Nongowa Chiefdom, Kenema district was on Friday 19 August, 2011 the latest community to be targeted. Anthony S. Kamara, in welcoming the ACC officials, expressed satisfaction over the visit as the people of Burma needed a lot of education on corruption and the operations of the commission. Chief A.J. Lamin, who chaired the meeting, expressed delight over the move by the ACC to engage and educate them on corruption, which he termed as enemy to the development of this war ravaged nation. He maintained that the commission alone cannot successfully curb corruption except with the support of all and sundry. He encouraged all to be attentive and seek clarifications to confusing concepts about the ACC and its operations. The District Coordinator of the ACC Kenema, Mohamed S. Blake, in declaring the purpose of such an engagement was quick to point out that the presence of the ACC in Burma was just one of their regular public education campaigns aimed at taking the commission to the people. He referred to the ACC as the lead agency in the fight against corruption in the country and thus seeks to recruit the public into the fight and as such was educating them on the operations of the commission, what constitutes corruption, how to report corruption and the benefits of a corrupt free nation. This is all aimed at better preparing them to join the national crusade against graft. He stated that corruption was one of the principal causes of the unrest that this country went through and called on all to stand firm against corruption and educate others to resist, reject and report instances of corruption to the ACC. Giving a brief overview and operations of the ACC, the Public Education Officer East, David K. Conteh spoke on the establishment of the commission by an Act of Parliament in 2000 as result of recommendations of the TRC. He added that the Anti-Corruption Act of 2008 has 27 corrupt practices and gives the commission prosecutorial powers. He spoke on the three operational wings of the ACC: education, prevention and prosecution. He stated that the ACC puts much premium on preventing corruption rather than prosecuting offenders. He encouraged people to abide by the laid down rules, regulations and policies. Acting Regional Manager East, Peter B. Kamara briefly spoke on the reporting procedures, the informant and witness protection and the 10% reward scheme, and encouraged his audience to break the culture of silence and report corruption. He highlighted some corrupt practices in the Anti-Corruption Act of 2008 and their respective penalties and encouraged all to serve as ACC ambassadors by educating other members of the community. He urged them to support the work of the commission by giving timely and credible information. He gave the ACC hotlines and encouraged the community people to utilize the opportunity by reporting corruption related issues to the commission. In his closing statement, Chief Bockarie Samai of Burma III community appreciated the ACC for the sensitization and called on all to be committed to the fight against graft. He registered his community's preparedness to support the commission in the interest of national development. Chief Mary Salamy, the women's leader moved the vote of thanks.

Most people hate it. A few benefit from it. Yet corruption is strong enough to have replaced traditional economic ethos of capital and production. No wonder the economic crises. Like economics there is a supply-side and demand-side for corruption. The supply-side or the giver resides in businesses. Businesses pay the bribes. The demand side or taker is predominantly government officials. Government officials demand bribes. In most discussions corruption is often blamed on government officials and seldom on the private sector. This is not to say that the private sector is the sole supplier. Literature is revealing that non governmental organisations are steady suppliers of corruption in developing countries. The centre piece of supply and demand for corruption in Africa and many advancing nations has been the many market oriented economic reform, such as privatisation. Public sector procurement for a long time now has attracted corrupt activities. In trying to find a cure for corruption it is important to consider both the supply and demand sides of corruption. Much has been said about the demand side and seldom on the role of the private sector as a supplier of corruption. The private sector is more cash liquid than the public sector, performance driven, profit motivated and always short of time. No cost no gain is an established rule of the profit game. Risk taking gives the game adrenalin. Entrepreneurs outperform one another in pursuit of profits. This desperation, risk inclination and willingness to pay whatever it takes render the private sector most gullible to demanders of bribes. In a survey carried out by the African Capital Markets Forum in Ghana during the year 2000, it was reported that 86 percent of households saw corruption as a major problem in the public sector, whereas 59 percent of households saw corruption as a major problem in the private sector. It was also found that many firms in Ghana made unofficial payments (44 percent) to public officials with over a quarter (27 percent) frequently or always making such payments. Unofficial payments constituted a regular feature of transactions between business firms and public service agencies. 56 percent of firms reported that service was frequently delivered once they made an unofficial payment. Although there is not much statistics on the level of private sector involvement in corruption in Zimbabwe, it is common knowledge that there is an increase in the supply of bribes in the country. How does good corporate governance reign in this corporate behaviour? Corporate governance spells out the rules and procedures for making decisions on corporate affairs. It also specifies the distribution of rights and responsibilities among different participants in companies such as the board, managers, shareholders, and other stakeholders. In addition corporate governance reminds businesses that while profits are important, businesses need ethics, customers and other stakeholders. Through corporate governance, corporations are warned of the dangers of putting profits first. Company leadership is also cautioned that when numbers become all-important, almost any behaviour is justifiable as long as money is made. Sound corporate governance standards reduce supply-side corruption by removing systemic opportunities that breed corruption. Principles of accountability, transparency, fairness and rule compliance help a good corporate governance system spell out the procedures for carrying out activities and responsibilities in an organisation. The system does not leave room for uncertainty of roles and power. An example of a good corporate governance mechanism is the transparency in the provision of accounting information. It helps reduce the level of corruption by increasing the probability of detecting bribery acts. Better accounting practices make it difficulty for directors to hide bribe payments. However, if the shareholder encourages bribery then accounting information might not be as effective in curbing corruption. Why then do corporations with good corporate governance systems pay bribes? First there has to be a conducive atmosphere for the supply and demand of bribery. This can take place in broad ranges of business activities over which some government officials hold discretionary powers. Common among these are; where firms bribe public officials to avoid or reduce tax, to secure public procurement contracts, to bypass laws and regulations, or to block the entry of potential competitors. On the surface bribery seems to be cost-effective for businesses because bribe payment is often a fraction of the monetary value of the services rendered by the corrupt officials. The reason to bribe becomes even more compelling when public officials hold the power to punish the firms for not paying the bribe, such as revoking business licenses. Corporates are often duped to believe that the only cost of bribery is paying the government officials. However, global research is showing that there are hidden costs to bribery, some of which can be fatal. Xun Wu in ""Corporate Governance and Corruption: A Cross-Country Analysis"" states that bribery exposes firms to substantial legal and financial risks in the future. Governments may decide to nullify contracts that have been initiated or influenced by bribery, or to blacklist the firms for future government projects. In the past the government of Singapore banned five multinational companies (Siemens, Pirelli, BICC, Marubeni, and Tomen), from bidding on any government projects for five years after their consultant was convicted of paying bribes for utilities construction contracts. Perhaps the most vicious is that, when companies open their doors to corruption, they may find it difficult to resist demands for bribery payments in the future. Research is also finding that companies with a reputation for bribing their way out are more likely to receive demands for higher bribe payment by corrupt officials, sometimes for services that are normally free of bribery for other companies. Bribe payment from firms with such a reputation may be perceived to be ""safe"" from the perspective of the potentially corrupt officials, and these corrupt officials may increase the level of bureaucratic interference in order to secure bribe payments from these firms. These companies become ""ka mugodhi"" or a private small mine for the officials. Xun Wu goes on to explain that, as a result firms that hope to circumvent government regulations may actually face an increased level of bureaucratic interference. Companies that pay more bribes face more, not less, effective red tape because corrupt officials can often customise the nature and amount of harassment on firms in order to maximise bribe collection. Bribery undermines the companies' drive in developing long-term competitive advantages. If managers realise that they can win business through bribery rather than through providing better products or services, they will be busy courting government officials rather than concentrating on developing the competitiveness of their firms through innovation and better investment decisions. This is detrimental to developing economies. Corporate governance is not only about dealing with the internal governance of a company but also with its relations to its suppliers, to its consumers, to its business partners, and to the government. Integrity and accountability are the values that guide the relationship between owners, managers, employees, and other stakeholders. Thus if the relations of the company, its suppliers and regulators are premised on bribery and corruption, as stated above, it will be difficult for the company to resist future demands for bribes. A strong board of directors that prioritises the interests of shareholders can prevent companies from giving bribes to public officials. Directors and managers determine the corporate culture. Yet, they often sign shady contracts, ignoring the negative implications. Non executive directors are systematically appointed in relation to their ability to influence outcomes with government relations. Such directors, instead of protecting the resources of the company, become conduits for bribe payments. While corruption offers companies short-term relief, good governance provides a longer-term, victory. Victors are those who protect their reputation and their shareholders. Prudent investors need assurances that their investments will not be channelled into unproductive activities. Entrepreneurs look for ways to attract investors to finance their visions. The aim is to make profits and maximise the value of the company. To achieve this, more and more corporations are coming up with corporate governance reforms. Investors are looking for businesses that uphold values of good corporate governance. Weak governance systems provide a good environment for corruption to thrive. Shareholders and investors in countries that are experiencing a high level of corruption may receive double dividends from the improvement in corporate governance. Companies with better corporate governance have better prospects of growth and command higher valuation in the market. A McKinsey study showed that global investors are willing to pay more for better-governed companies. It is said that inorder to kill off a bad habit, starve it. Private sector has the muscle to starve off corruption - stop supplying. Anti-corruption activists encourage private sector to adopt good corporate governance.

Likando appeared in the Caprivi Regional Court in Katima Mulilo last week before Magistrate William Kastomo. The case was postponed to October 3 and his bail was extended. Likando's case was set for plea and trial last week, but the trial could not start as Likando's lawyer, Matildah Shakwa of Sisa Namandje Legal Practitioners, was absent due to personal reasons. The charges against Likando date back to between May 2005 and February 2008 when he was employed by the Offshore Development Company at Katima Mulilo. He faces four charges of contravening the Anti-Corruption Act. It is alleged that he corruptly used his office and position for personal gratification after he allegedly rented company stall units in the Economic Processing Zone (EPZ) for personal enrichment at the company's expense. In an unrelated development, the Katima Mulilo Town Council is still awaiting the outcome of last month's disciplinary hearing involving its chief executive officer, Vincent Sazita, and finance chief Charles Nawa. Sazita and Nawa have been suspended from duty since April 20 this year. Charles Matengu, chairperson of the Katima Mulilo Town Council's management committee, said yesterday that the council was still awaiting the verdict of the disciplinary committee. Both Sazita and Nawa have been charged with misconduct in the performance of their duties. Sazita's charges include ""failure to ensure that all policies and decisions of the council and management committee are executed effectively and efficiently"". Sazita has also been charged with failure to provide guidance, advice and leadership to the council, as well as a failure to assume accountability for all financial dealings undertaken by the council, and a failure to maintain effective communication with all stakeholders. Nawa, the chief financial officer, is accused of ""irregular salary increments during the period 2007-2010"", failure to be responsible for revenue assurance, failure to establish and maintain internal control procedures and to assure the management and council that accounting procedures are maintained. Nawa is also charged with failure to comply with accounting legislation, accounting standards and good practice as well as failure to maintain and collect council revenue. Both Sazita and Nawa have alleged that proper procedures relating to their suspension were not followed, but these claims were dismissed by Matengu."204,Concord Times (Freetown),9/13/11,Journalists Form Alliance Against Corruption,,SIERRA LEONE (90%),Newspaper,Ibrahim Tarawallie,ENGLISH,,,13-Sep-11,,366  words,CORRUPTION (98%); JOURNALISM (91%); WRITERS (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); NEWS REPORTING (79%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (72%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (71%) Sierra Leone; Corruption; Press and Media,"Media practitioners across Sierra Leone have formed a strong alliance to help the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) in its quest to curtail corruption in the country. The group, Media Alliance Against Corruption (MAAC), was established at the end of a 3-day national training for journalists organised by the ACC and the Sierra Leone Association of Journalists (SLAJ) at the J&E Resort in Bo on the theme: ""Good Governance and Investigative Journalism: The Role of the Media in Corruption Control"". With the setting up of the group, journalists would work closely with the country's anti-graft agency in the fight against corruption. MAAC is charged with the responsibility of raising public awareness on corruption, its causes and consequences and report cases of corruption for the commission's attention. Acting ACC Commissioner, Morlai Buya Kamara, expressed the commission's delight at the establishment of MAAC, saying the ACC will support the group all through to ensure its success in its objectives. ""We are very much encouraged as a commission by the setting up of such a group,"" Mr. Kamara said. ""We will be pleased to work with MAAC to report corrupt issues and stop this menace in our nation. We will give them all the support they need to succeed."" To demonstrate his commission's readiness to work with MAAC, Mr. Kamara presented the sum of Le1 million to the group to kick-start their campaign. While imploring journalists to have a vision and passion for their work, the acting ACC boss pointed out that the commission will welcome objective comments and criticisms from the media. ""I advise you to do more investigations and follow-ups in your reporting. I am aware that your task is challenging but not insurmountable,"" he noted. MAAC's acting National Coordinator Melvin Rogers thanked the ACC boss for his personal donation and assured him of the group's determination to ensure that the fight against corruption is won. Rogers promised to seek SLAJ's recognition of the group and put modalities in place to hold a convention to elect its national executive. After the launch of the group by Mr. Kamara, the training came to an end with the distribution of certificates to participants."205,The Herald (Harare),9/16/11,Let's Gang-Fight Corruption [opinion],,ZIMBABWE (96%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,16-Sep-11,,881  words,CORRUPTION (96%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); POLITICS (89%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (89%); PRIME MINISTERS (78%); ETHICS (77%); BRIBERY (77%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (71%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Rabid critics of the Zimbabwean Government, chief among them, Transparency International have been parroting a white lie incessantly that ""there is no political will in the country to fight corruption"". This is so because the country's leadership has used every opportunity to castigate and speak against corruption in the different sectors of the economy. Only recently at the burial of Retired General Solomon Mujuru, President Mugabe said ""corruption is there in the country among us and only a thief gets rich overnight. We have laws and we don't want a country of thieves, but we want a country with people with discipline"" This statement was followed last week by the swearing in of a nine-member Anti-Corruption Commission by President Mugabe marking the beginning of concerted efforts by the inclusive Government to curb the vice. The vice has condemned the country to number 134 out of 178 nations ranking by the Transparency International (2010), Corruption Perceptions Index. Recognition of corruption as a problem in the country and subsequent action taken by President Mugabe is tangible evidence that there is political will to tackle the problem. But the truth be told, the buck does not stop with the Head of State to curb this vice which cuts across political, social and economic divide and has deadly effects on politics, economy, administration and national institutions, posing a serious threat to development. We all envision a corruption-free society where its citizens are guarded by national interest, professionalism, integrity and ubuntu for the development of the nation. Thus, every Zimbabwean has a role to play if we are going to win the war against such degeneracy. One would like to believe the first Anti-Corruption Commission sworn in on September 8, 2005 was not successful because Zimbabweans disassociated themselves from the problem but expected miracles to happen. The country had witnessed unprecedented corruption fuelled by the crippling effects of the illegal sanctions, which had strangled the macro-economic environment. As one writer once alluded, ""the country has been reduced to a nation of dealers out to make a quick buck from the corridors of power, street alleys to flea markets"". It had become the norm that if one wants to get service in government departments one had to be prepared to part with one's hard-earned cash. The private sector has not been spared as well, as corruption increases the cost of business through the price of illicit payments, bribes and kickbacks. There is no place for blame games in fighting corruption. PM Morgan Tsvangirai once said, ""the (Prime Minister) needs the support of ethical and professional leaders in Government who stand ready to fight corruption. I don't see this in the crop of public bureaucrats we have, especially from the Zanu-PF party."" PM Tsvangirai's naive statement was before the rot in his own party, especially in the councils was exposed. The MDC, embarrassed at the scale of the corruption of its own officials led shame-faced Tsvangirai to say ""we have cases of people who were push-cart operators before they became councillors but now have 10 cars each. Many others were simple market traders are now in big business because of corruption"". The Prime Minister was made to eat his words as he acknowledged ""we admit that our basket has bad apples, but we cannot throw away the whole basket, unfortunately others are now falling for this culture of corruption"". ""A lot of our councillors have breached the citizen's charter and flouted tender procedures. Our councillors have been emulating and imitating the Zanu-PF model of a councillor."" The undeniable truth is, corruption cuts across the social, economic and political divide, so it needs the concerted efforts of every Zimbabwe. Thus, fighting corruption is not a one-man fight. According to a United Nations (UN) paper entitled Corruption & Anti-corruption in Southern Africa, the media has a role to play in ""responsibly investigating, reporting and exposing corruption without undermining the credibility of anti-corruption efforts"". While civil society organisations have a role to play in monitoring, raising public awareness, research and prevention"" ""Corruption is as much structurally conditioned as it is a personal-choice driven behaviour"". Thus, in corruption vulnerable areas (customs, police, procurement, licences and permits, education, employment, immigration and border controls, revenue collection, judiciary) anti-corruption strategies and polices ought to seek to reduce structural opportunities for corruption as well as motivational factors to corrupt and or to be corrupted"", the paper rightly pointed out. While at the same time, Zimbabweans will be complementing the functions of the Anti-Corruption Commission, which among other things is to 1) investigate cases of corruption in the public and private sectors 2) combat corruption and abuse of power 3) promote honesty, financial discipline and transparency in the public and private sectors 4) secure the prosecution of persons involved in corrupt activities. Political will to fight corruption and support anti-corruption efforts is imperative if the country is to succeed in combating this deadly vice.

Boois had pleaded not guilty to 24 counts of corruption at the start of his trial in August. It is alleged that Boois had used his position as governor for gratification by pocketing a monthly housing subsidy of N$7 500 for two years while he was living in a government house. Boois admitted that he had received a subsidy while living in a government house, but denied he had used his position for gratification as charged. Jacobs yesterday told the court that Boois was verbally encouraged and advised to voluntarily ask to have his housing subsidy payment stopped because he had forfeited it after moving into a government house in May 2005. Boois did not follow this advice, Jacobs testified. Asked why the administration had allowed the subsidy payment to continue while Boois was occupying a government house, Jacobs said his consent was needed. Because of Boois's silence on the matter, Jacobs added, the administration was forced to write to him on September 4 2007 with a proposal to enter into negotiations for an amicable way to solve the matter. Jacobs said only when the regional council started the process to recover the subsidy payments of close to N$180 000 and to stop payments, Boois responded through his legal representative on September 18 2007. The lawyer demanded that the administration repay Boois the N$7 500 it had deducted from his salary and to desist from making further deductions, according to Jacobs. He added the lawyer also threatened with a ""mandatory interdict"" should the administration ignore his demands. Jacobs added that the recovery process was initiated on the advice by Regional and Local Government Ministry permanent secretary Erastus Negonga. The process to rectify the illegal payments had taken almost two years because of protracted negotiations between the council administration and Boois, Jacobs replied when asked why the administration had not implemented a Cabinet resolution stipulating that political office bearers should forfeit the subsidy when occupying a government house. Boois vacated the house two months after the debt recovery had been implemented, said Jacobs. Grilled by defence counsel Sisa Namandje whether Boois had used his position as governor to have the house allocated to him, or had influenced the council not to stop his illegal subsidy payments, Jacobs replied: ""Charges were put by someone else, and someone else must answer it"". State Prosecutor Pieter Smit requested a postponement to summons an Anti-Corruption Commission investigator to testify. Despite Namandje's objections, Regional Magistrate Sunsley Zisengwe granted the postponement. The trial will continue on May 2 and 3 next year."209,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),9/27/11,President Sata Renews Hope in Corruption Fight,,ZAMBIA (96%),Newspaper,Whitney Mulobela,ENGLISH,,,28-Sep-11,,866  words,POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (77%); RULE OF LAW (77%); INTERVIEWS (77%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (72%); LAWYERS (71%); SUPREME COURTS (70%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (70%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (69%); NARCOTICS ENFORCEMENT (60%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (60%); POLICE FORCES (50%) Zambia; Governance; Corruption,"IT is a fact that corruption has been and still remains a serious cancer that has eaten into the vital fiber of the Zambian society. While efforts have been made by successive governments, especially under late President Levy Mwanawasa's government, corruption has remained a great challenge to the country's economic development. Worse still corruption affects the poor of the poor. The effect of corruption, as observed by many, has many dimensions related to political, economic, social and environmental effects. It is therefore refreshing that newly elected President Michael Sata has prioritised the fight against corruption. In his inaugural speech at the Supreme Court on Friday September 24, President Sata pledged that his administration would have zero tolerance for corruption. He said his administration shall ensure full accountability of national resources. ""It is not the wish nor intention of the incoming government to victimise anyone but as indicated during our campaigns, we shall have zero tolerance for corruption. ""As President I give my solemn promise to the citizenry of this country as well as to our partners who entrust us with their money that this government will steadily tackle this scourge with the vigour it deserves,"" he said President Sata said corruption is morally unacceptable and that those charged with the responsibility of looking after the country's resource should guard them jealously. Because of corruption, resources meant for service provision in the health, education and other sectors are diverted to benefit individuals. And as many stakeholders have observed, the stance by President Sata would greatly benefit Zambia. Transparency International Zambia president Reuben Lifuka says President Sata's prioritising of the corruption fight is a sure way of propelling Zambia to economic success. ""It is a significant point and we welcome the pronouncements, we hope to see transformation from words to action. We want to see an action plan that will help the country to fight corruption,"" he said. Mr Lifuka said in a recent interview that however the new government would also need to strengthen relevant institutions such as the Anti Corruption Commission (ACC) and the police service. He said the new government should ensure that relevant institutions, including the Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) as well as the Auditor General's office are strengthened to remain relevant. Former Task Force chairperson Maxwell Nkole said President Sata needs the support of all Zambians in the fight against corruption. ""We hope to see that the instruments of justice are restored back to original credibility. There should be no interference of the judiciary but ensuring that there is rule of law,"" he said. Mr Nkole said Zambians were anxious to see a vigorous campaign against corruption which had reduced during the MMD tenure. Former Attorney General Mumba Malila is hopeful that the PF under the leadership of President Sata will ensure all corrupt leaders should not be spared. ""I hope the fight against corruption will go back to Levy's (Mwanawasa) time because recently we saw a reduction and reversal of the fight against corruption, such as the removal of the abuse of office clause from the constitution,"" he said. Mr Malila said there is need for the new government to put in place an appropriate legal framework. ""The first thing should be to put in place the appropriate legal framework. Then the international conventions that we have signed such as the AU (African Union) convention and the UN (United Nations) convention against corruption should be domesticated,"" he said. In the political sphere, corruption impedes democracy and the rule of law. In a democratic system, public institutions and offices may lose their legitimacy when they misuse their power for private interest. Corruption may also result in negative consequences such as encoring cynicism and reducing interest of political participation, political instability, and reducing political competition, reducing the transparency of political decision making, distorting political development and sustaining political activity based on patronage, clientelism and money. The economic effects of corruption can be categorised as minor and major. However, both in one way or the other have serious impact on the individual community and country. First and foremost, corruption leads to the depletion of national wealth. ""It is often responsible for increased costs of goods and services, the funnelling of scarce public resources to uneconomic high profile projects at the expense of the much needed projects such as schools, hospitals and roads, or the supply of potable water, diversion and misallocation of resources, conversion of public wealth to private and personal property, inflation, imbalanced economic development, weakling work ethics and professionalism, hindrance of the development of fair in market structures and unhealthy competition there by deterring competition. Large scale corruption hurts the economy and impoverishes entire population,"" reads a recent report on corruption. President Sata's prioritising of the fight against corruption therefore is a step in the right direction."210,Addis Fortune,10/1/11,"Yaregal Aysheshum, Family Assets Frozen Over Allegation of Corruption",,ETHIOPIA (79%),Newspaper,Eden Sahle,ENGLISH,,,2-Nov-11,,478 words,CORRUPTION (94%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); ARRESTS (89%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (78%); ETHICS (77%); AGREEMENTS (77%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (77%); CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTING (76%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (76%); CHILDREN (75%); BOARDING SCHOOLS (74%); EMBEZZLEMENT (72%); VOCATIONAL & TECHNICAL TRAINING (71%); RESTAURANTS (66%); TEACHER EDUCATION (64%) Ethiopia; Corruption,"Assets of Yaregar Aysehshume, MP and director general of the Federal Cooperative Agency, have been frozen by the Federal High Court on October 20, 2011 following a request from prosecutors of the Federal Ethics & Anti-Corruption Commission (FEACC). The assets were frozen on the same day as Yaregal was arrested on suspicion of corruption in the bidding procedures of the construction of three educational institutions which cost 83 million Br during his tenure as president of the Benishangul-Gumuz Regional State. Assets registered under Yaregal's wife, Tigist Bekal and his two children, who are minors, have also been frozen on the request of Beryehune Asegdom, public prosecuter of the Anti-Corruption Commission. The former Director General's house, built on 1,204sqm of land in Assosa, 675km from the capital, a 1,000sqm plot, both in Benishangul Region, and a 500sqm plot in Bole district, registered under his name have been frozen. A total of 4,132sqm plot in the region, a one storey house resting on 500sqm in Oromia Regional State, a 500sqm plot in Bole district and a condominium house, and restaurant all registered under his wife's name were also frozen. The court has additionally frozen a 1,490sqm plot in the region registered under one of Yaregal's child's names. Also under arrest for involvement in the corruption is Gezahgne Hadge, manager of Gad Construction and Habtamu Hica, former head of the region's Education Bureau and speaker of the house for the region's Parliament. Gezahgne was arrested only two days after Yaregal while Habtamu was arrested a while back. All of the men are suspected of corrupt involvement in the construction of Tana Beles, a boarding school for women; Gilgel Beles Teachers Training Collage as well Technical and Vocational Training centres that were planned to be constructed in five zones of the regional state six years ago. Investigators of the FEACC are claiming that proper bidding and procurement procedures were not followed. As a result, the project, which was supposed to have been finished in 13 months, is not yet completed. The Commission claims that this has resulted in a loss of seven million Birr in payments outside of the contract agreement. Gad Construction, established in 1993, was one of the contractors that allegedly awarded the project through an improper bidding process. Although the Commission received tips about the alleged embezzlement at the end of 2009, the investigation and evidence gathering took time, according to the Commission. The arrest of Yaregal and Habtamu was held back until Parliament had resumed session. Yaregal's immunity was revoked by the house on October 18, 2011, a week after Parliament was back in session. The investigation has yet to uncover the exact amount paid by contractors to Yaregal and Habtamu for their alleged undue advantage, according to the Commission."211,The Namibian (Windhoek),10/7/11,Corruption Trial of Health Permanent Secretary Underway,,NAMIBIA (93%),Newspaper,Denver Kisting,ENGLISH,,,13-Oct-11,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (70%)",124  words,CORRUPTION (91%); MAGISTRATES (90%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (88%); AIRPORTS (51%) Namibia; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"KAHIJORO Kahuure, the Permanent Secretary (PS) in the Ministry of Health and Social Services, maintains that he had authorisation to use the Government car over which he now faces graft charges.

Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Republic of Namibia (ELCRN) member Gerson Doseb said the ACC has opened a case against Pastor Japhet Sem and Eunice Nakapunda of the ELCRIN Macedonian parish, while it failed to investigate suspected fraud or theft at a number of church institutions which he, Doseb, had reported to the ACC and the Ombudsman's office in 2008. The ACC at the time responded that after a preliminary investigation, there was no evidence that constitutes an act of corruption in terms of the ACC Act. It said the matter does not fall under its mandate of investigation, and referred_ Doseb's allegations to the Namibian Police. Doseb claimed that some of the money implicated in the suspected fraud and theft he reported, was Government funding that went towards schools run by ELCRN, thus that there was sufficient reason why the ACC and the Office of the Ombudsman should do an investigation. ""Why this selective justice?"" questioned Doseb yesterday. He charged that two members of the Macedonia parish where Sem and Nakapunda were investigated for fraud and theft, are working at the ACC, and were responsible for the charges made against Sem and Nakapunda. ""They abused their influence at the ACC,"" charged Doseb. ""The ACC abused its position and State machinery to meddle in something that is not under their jurisdiction,"" said Do""seb, referring to the Sem and Nakapunda case now before the High Court. ""If money is stolen from the church, it must go the same way as Pastor Sem,"" suggested Doseb. Noa said the cases cannot be compared because the alleged transactions are entirely different. In the case of Pastor Sem, he said, money was siphoned off from one account into another account, and some funds reportedly even went out of the country. Noa said Doseb had merely made an allegation of fraud and theft without any evidence, which the ACC referred to the police for investigation. ""It does not mean that if money is stolen the ACC should investigate it,"" said Noa. ""One must look at the circumstances of the allegations."""213,The Namibian (Windhoek),10/17/11,Ex-Air Nam Employees Charged With Corruption,,NAMIBIA (97%),Newspaper,Werner Menges,ENGLISH,,,17-Oct-11,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (88%)",403  words,CORRUPTION (92%); HOLDING COMPANIES (90%); AIR CHARTER SERVICES (90%); AIRLINES (90%); MAGISTRATES (89%); TRAVEL TICKETS (78%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (77%); INVESTIGATIONS (75%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (75%); LAWYERS (73%); BAIL (72%); ARRESTS (72%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (71%); PUBLIC RELATIONS (71%) Namibia; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Company News,"THREE and a half years after his sudden resignation from a senior post at Air Namibia, the national airline's former spokesperson, Ellison Hijarunguru, has now been charged with twenty counts of corruption. Hijarunguru and a former colleague, Anthony Alberts Rickerts, made a first appearance in the Windhoek Magistrate's Court on twenty charges under the Anti-Corruption Act on Friday. Hijarunguru (52) was Air Namibia's Public Relations and Corporate Communications Manager until his resignation in March 2008. He resigned a few days after he had been suspended from his post in the wake of allegations about irregularities with the use of flight tickets which the airline was supposedly exchanging for other services under barter agreements. Rickerts (42) worked as a sales representative at the airline. According to the Anti-Corruption Commission, which investigated the allegations that led to the court appearance of the two men, Hijarunguru and Rickerts are accused of having used their positions to obtain a gratification for their own benefit or that of another person. A barter agreement between Air Namibia and media group Democratic Media Holdings (DMH) is at the centre of the charges against the two men. At the time of Hijarunguru's resignation it was reported that allegations had surfaced about the abuse of barter agreements in terms of which the airline exchanged air tickets for free newspapers and advertisements. In a statement released on Friday, the ACC claimed the two men have been implicated in regard to allegations that they placed people who were not employees of DMH, which had a barter agreement with Air Namibia, or who were not affiliated with the company, on the barter agreement, while these people were not entitled to such a benefit. In the process, it is claimed, the two men pocketed a total of N$206 077 for themselves. Hijarunguru and Rickerts were arrested on Thursday last week after the Prosecutor General decided to charge them with 20 counts under the Anti-Corruption Act. With their appearance before Magistrate Ingrid Unengu on Friday, they were granted bail of N$10 000 each. Their case was transferred to the Windhoek Regional Court, where they have to appear on November 11. They have not yet been asked to plead to the charges.

Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille also applauded Zuma's announcement that national police commissioner General Bheki Cele was suspended with immediate effect. ""This announcement is better late than never,"" she said in a statement. Zuma announced earlier in Pretoria that Mahlangu-Nkabinde would be replaced as public works minister, and Shiceka as co-operative governance and traditional affairs minister. Zille said Zuma's government had been beset by controversy for several months. Public Protector Thuli Madonsela urged Zuma to take strong action against those involved in the SA Police Service lease deals, as well as Shiceka for his abuse of public money. Zille lauded Zuma ""for reaffirming his government's commitment to the role of the public protector and other Chapter Nine institutions"". The ANC said the Cabinet reshuffle would contribute significantly to strengthening government performance and capacity. ""In this regard, the ANC would [like] to praise and equally endorse the president's action and decisiveness,"" spokesperson Jackson Mthembu said in a statement. The ANC also welcomed Zuma's announcement that Supreme Court of Appeal Judge Willie Seriti would head the new commission of inquiry into the arms deal. African Christian Democratic Party leader Kenneth Meshoe said action against the two ministers was long overdue. ""What we still want to see happen is Mr Shiceka paying back the taxpayers' money he wasted on his alleged visit to his imprisoned girlfriend in Switzerland,"" he said. Freedom Front Plus spokesperson Pieter Groenewald also welcomed Zuma's announcements, as did the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (Casac). ""We believe that the president has acted appropriately in responding to the reports of the public protector regarding the misdemeanours by these two former ministers,"" Casac said in a statement. Casac welcomed Cele's immediate suspension and the appointment of a board of inquiry to investigate his role in the SAPS leases. The Congress of SA Trade Unions said it hoped the announcement marked a turning point in the fight against maladministration and corruption. ""From now on there must be a policy of zero-tolerance to the looting of public resources by anyone, in the public or private sector, no matter how senior their position,"" the trade union federation said in a statement. Civil rights group AfriForum said Zuma's decision sent a strong and essential message regarding the accountability and responsibility of people in positions of power. - Nampa-Sapa"215,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),10/28/11,Police to Stamp Out Corruption [editorial],,ZAMBIA (94%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,28-Oct-11,,434 words,CORRUPTION (91%); POLICE FORCES (91%); FINES & PENALTIES (90%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (89%); BRIBERY (78%); POLICE MISCONDUCT (78%); EXTORTION (73%); WAGES & SALARIES (71%); APPROVALS (68%) Zambia; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Corruption,"THE police command deserves commendation for acting swiftly to stamp out corruption in the traffic section of the Zambia Police Service by banning on-the-spot fines imposed on erring motorists at police roadblocks. Many of the sordid cases of corruption that have sullied the image of the whole police service emanate from this wing because the bulk of traffic officers are now associated with numerous cases of impropriety. It would be an under-statement to state that traffic officers had become shameless extortionists. Many have been caught red-handed soliciting for bribes and harassing their victims at every opportunity, and all this happened under the noses of senior police officers who elected to do nothing to stop the rot. The net import of this inaction is that the vice spread quickly within the service, and an impression was created that corruption among police officers, particularly those in the traffic wing, had the tacit approval of the police command. Police Inspector-General Martin Malama has sent the right message by taking timely action, soon after assumption of office, by banning on-spot fines by traffic officers who will now be required to issue tickets to offending motorists so that they could make payments at police stations. It is indisputable that the bulk of the cash collected by police in fines was never properly accounted for but ended up in the pockets of corrupt officers. There are no more grounds now for police officers to bemoan low salaries and lack of motivation as the reasons for engaging in corrupt practices. To begin with, there is no justification anywhere and at any time, for any person to commit an offence. But more importantly is the fact that under the new government, the police service has everything to look forward to. President Sata has already demonstrated his commitment to improve conditions in the police service through rationalisation of salaries. He has further motivated the service by widening the ranking structure in the service with the creation of eleven positions for commissioners of police from two positions and six of the new police commissioners are female. These changes have opened up avenues for every serving officer both male and female to aspire to senior positions in the service. This will in turn open up the subsidiary ranks so that those in the lower ranks of the service also move up to fill senior ranks as they are promoted. This is the motivation that should spur the police service to even greater efforts to attain higher heights in the fight against corruption and criminal activity where ever it is found in Zambia."216,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),10/28/11,Lebanon Backs Govt's Corruption Fight Stance,,"ZAMBIA (95%); LEBANON (94%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (79%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (79%)",Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,28-Oct-11,,206 words,CORRUPTION (94%); POLICE FORCES (71%); COPPER INDUSTRY (69%); ARRESTS (69%) Zambia; Corruption,"HONORARY counsellor of Lebanon in Zambia, Hussein Safieddine has said his government supports President Michael Sata's stance on fighting corruption and that Lebanese in the country engaging in corrupt practices would not have his support.

Joseph Madhimba, head of department (HOD) for business management, accused the institution's registrar, Corneels Jafta, of, amongst others, ""very poor communication skills and is arrogant, foul-mouthed and provocative"". Furthermore, Madhimba charged, Jafta ""has no respect for other academics and does not listen to others"". In a letter of complaint to the Deputy Minister of Education, David Namwandi, Madhimba charged that after 19 of 33 students did not qualify for the International Marketing examination, he was summoned to Jafta's office to explain. A copy of the letter is in the possession of The Namibian. During this meeting with Jafta, Madhimba alleges, the registrar wanted to know why two students, Linda Antonio and Ester Kakonge, had not made the cut. ""I told him [they did not qualify] because they performed poorly. I also asked him whether these two were supposed to pass even if they failed."" According to Madhimba, ""a heated argument then followed in which the registrar insulted me using some language which is better not put down on paper. I recorded what he was saying on my portable tape recorder. I said to him he should not insult me. He said: 'Of course, I am insulting you and what can you do to me?'."" Madhimba says this is ""intimidation as if he was daring me to a physical fight"". The now 'suspended' HOD claims Jafta ""ordered me to change the marks so that more students could qualify, including Antonio and Kakonge"" - something which he says he refused to do. ""I told Mr Jafta that I don't want to be involved in corruption and so I refused to change the marks, because this would be unfair to the other students, who, through their own efforts, had qualified for the examination."" As a result of the drama surrounding the subject, Jafta subsequently postponed the examination to November 18. This reportedly has some students fuming. Another reason why he refused to adjust marks, Madhimba says, was because ""I think we should not lower standards and compromise quality by changing marks given by a lecturer simply because some students perceive others were favoured"". Madhimba has also accused his dean, Kofi Boamah, of being in cahoots with Jafta. Another allegation which Madhimba has levelled against Jafta is that the registrar allegedly instructed him to allow ""into a degree programme, the son of his friend who did not have the prerequisite diploma"". Because he allegedly did not comply with the entry requirements, ""the student is now struggling"", Madhimba charges. ""The problem with Mr Jafta is that he claims to be professional, but then he breaks the Poly regulations and policies when it suits him. That is a recipe for disaster in this institution of higher learning."" He asked Namwandi ""to intervene to stop the rot at the Poly, especially intimidation, interference with lecturers' marks and other forms of corruption"". Last year, Jafta also came under fire for allegedly helping his daughter get into a course for which she was not qualified. In a written response to the newspaper's questions, Polytechnic spokesperson Donovan Weimers on Friday said that Madhimba's ""allegations come in the wake of his suspension and the filing of disciplinary charges against him on Thursday, November 3 2011"". Weimers said that in terms of the institution's communication policy, ""disciplinary procedures instituted against, or grievances lodged by, individual staff members are sub judice. We are therefore not at liberty to comment on Mr Madhimba's allegations regarding the reasons for his suspension"". Unless The Namibian clarifies its sources about the corruption and intimidation claims, ""it is not the Polytechnic's policy to respond to hearsay and thus we have no comment on these allegations"", Weimers said."219,The Namibian (Windhoek),11/9/11,Region Protocol Against Corruption Idles,,NAMIBIA (94%); SOUTHERN AFRICA (94%); AFRICA (94%); MALAWI (92%) Southern Africa,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,9-Nov-11,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (93%)",412 words,CORRUPTION (95%); TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (90%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); INTERNATIONAL LAW (77%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (75%); RULE OF LAW (74%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (73%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (73%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (60%) Namibia; Corruption,"The ninth Southern African Forum Against Corruption (Safac) Annual General Meeting (AGM) which started in Windhoek yesterday made an urgent call on SADC members to implement the SADC Protocol Against Corruption. Safac chair Dr Edward Hoseah blamed the non-functioning SADC Committee on Corruption (SACC) for the delay in the implementation of the protocol at the opening of the event. ""The Southern African Development Community (SADC) Protocol Against Corruption and its implementation is our litmus test for effective measures in our region. The willingness of our political masters to heighten and fast-track the implementation of the SADC Protocol is extremely fundamental to manage our citizens' expectations,"" he stressed. The Heads of State and Government signed the protocol in Blantyre, Malawi in the year 2001. However, Hoseah expressed his concern about the protocol, which was adopted before the African Union (AU) Convention on Preventing and Combating of Corruption, as well as the United Nations' Convention Against Corruption in 2003, respectively. According to him, the fundamental question that each SADC member has to answer is to what extent have they ratified and put in place not only the legal framework for its implementation, but also the strategic interventions that address the daunting challenges that corruption imposes on the economic, political and social realities. Hoseah emphasised that political will is the ability of the executive arm of a government to confront corruption without compromises. ""It is the commitment of the entire leadership to restore integrity and promote transparency and accountability, where democratic principles and rule of law are respected and given prominence in the day-to-day functioning of the government,"" he added. Meanwhile, Namibia's Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) Director Paulus Noa said that SADC needs to accelerate the implementation of developmental programmes, noting that this is only guaranteed when oversight institutions are well co-ordinated, strengthened and adequately funded. With the advent of regional, continental and international legal instruments on the prevention and fight against corruption, the question is no longer merely about investigation and prosecution of the culprits. Noa said it is also more about regional and international co-operation, aimed at mutual legal assistance for purposes of confiscation and recovery of stolen assets or proceeds of crime, wherever they are found."220,The New Times (Kigali),11/10/11,"Report Corruption Cases, Watchdog Urges",,RWANDA (94%); BOTSWANA (79%); CAPE VERDE (79%); MAURITIUS (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,10-Nov-11,,321 words,CORRUPTION (95%); INTERVIEWS (90%); POLLS & SURVEYS (76%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (75%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (70%); POLICE FORCES (68%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (66%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (64%) Rwanda; Corruption; NGOs and Civil Society,"The Executive Secretary of Transparency Rwanda (TR), Apollinaire Mupiganyi, has called for a change in mindset in the fight against all forms of corruption in the country.

""Our survey established full political will from all government institutions; however, we realised that over 50 percent of the population don't report cases of corruption and this is a serious issue which needs an urgent solution,"" Mupiganyi. He said that mindsets can be changed through public awareness campaigns, encouraging them to always report such cases to concerned authorities. Rwanda was recently ranked the fourth least corrupt African country by the World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) project. The country scored 70.8 percent, the fourth highest score, behind Mauritius with 73.2 percent, Cape Verde with 74.6 percent and Botswana, the least corrupt with 79.9 percent. Mupiganyi noted that if all Rwandans take part in reporting cases of graft, the dream of achieving zero corruption, would be achieved, which he said, would translate into rapid development. The TR survey indicated that corruption was most prevalent in local government authorities and other institutions like the National Police, especially the traffic department. Speaking to The New Times, the acting Ombudsman, Augustin Nzindukiyimana, said that his office had set up anti-corruption committees at the district and other local levels, to fight the vice. He however said that there was need for civil society organisations to actively participate in fighting against corruption. ""The war against corruption is cross-cutting and a continuous process, which needs every citizen's participation,"" he observed."221,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),11/10/11,"Stop ZRA Corruption, Ex- State House Aide Urges Govt",,ZAMBIA (94%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,10-Nov-11,,206 words,CORRUPTION (90%); PUBLIC FINANCE (88%); TAXES & TAXATION (87%); INVESTIGATIONS (72%); TAX EXEMPTIONS (70%); TAX LAW (70%) Zambia; Corruption,"FORMER State House economic adviser Donald Chanda has said the Government should ensure that it gets rid of the perceived corruption at Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) for the institution to deliver to the expectations of the country. Appearing before the Kingsley Chanda-led commission of inquiry on ZRA, Dr Chanda said it was important for the Government to work with ZRA to stop any corrupt practices and instill confidence in tax payers. Dr Chanda also urged Government not to concession borders but instead work with ZRA to make some borders multi-facility economic zones. He said the Government should also avoid some tax exemptions as they might be injurious to ZRA. Dr Chanda, who is a University of Zambia lecturer in development studies, said the Government should broaden the tax base to collect more revenue. ""There is need to continue building capacity for ZRA to collect more revenue,"" he said. He said there should be no delays in revenue collection and that the public should be educated on the role of ZRA and the tax they pay. Dr Chanda said Zambians wanted to see how their money was being used and urged the Government to assist them in that area. He said the Government should also improve conditions of service for ZRA officers."222,Concord Times (Freetown),11/11/11,Tikonko Community Embraces Anti-Corruption Commission's Fight Against Corruption,,SIERRA LEONE (92%),Newspaper,Rachel Horner,ENGLISH,,,15-Nov-11,,811 words,CORRUPTION (94%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (90%); RURAL COMMUNITIES (89%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (89%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (86%); INVESTIGATIONS (77%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (72%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (70%); INDICTMENTS (69%); RURAL DEVELOPMENT (67%); STRATEGIC PLANNING (63%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (60%) Sierra Leone; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Governance,"The Southern Regional Office of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has on Wednesday 26th October 2011 admonished all stakeholders including school going children in the Tikonko community to desist from corrupt practices and promote good governance. Welcoming the team from the ACC and giving an overview of what he views about the work of the Anti-Corruption Commission, the Chiefdom Speaker Mr. George S. Murray pledged support to the course of fighting graft in his community and implored everyone in their midst to join the fight. Mr. Murray gave some scenarios of existence of corruption and corrupt practices and stressed the need for community stakeholders to be accountable in their service delivery activities for the general good of the nation. Giving an overview of the meeting and also updating his audience on the current activities undertaken by the commission, the Public Education Officer South, Mr. Wilfred Bangura, said that the Anti-Corruption Commission was at Tikonko village because they alone cannot fight corruption in the country. He called on all present to partner with the Commission as that will demonstrate a mark of patriotism. Mr. Bangura explained the three-pronged approach used by the Commission in the fight against graft. According to him, this exercise presents the friendly face of the commission. The ACC also prides itself in fixing institutions where loop holes are bound to occur in service delivery. If both prevention and public education interventions fail, then the last resort will be confrontation which means individuals who perpetrate corrupt practices will be investigated, prosecuted and convicted in a competent court of law. Mr. Bangura further told participants about the Commission's strategic plan (2011-2013) recently presented by the Commissioner of the ACC, Mr. Joseph Fitzgerald Kamara to H.E the President, Dr Ernest Bai Koroma. He also briefed participants of the commission's recent indictments and pointed out clearly that the Commission is not just there to arrest and convict corrupt individuals but also to sensitise the public on the ills of corruption. Participants were then informed about the various ways of making reports to the ACC and assured them of the commission's fullest protection of informers. Dilating on the causes and effects of corruption particularly in rural communities, the Regional manager south, Mr. Mohamed Dumbuya, underscored that corruption is prevalent in rural communities_ because of greed and selfishness. He opined that poverty is one of the root causes of   corruption. Manager Dumbuya made mention of the negative effects of corruption which he said undermines the development of Sierra Leone, affects human rights, hurts the poor,  brings about war and diseases to name but a few. He encouraged the people of Tikonko to be very mindful of development initiatives carried out in their chiefdom and informed participants that rural development is not an exclusive favour from Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) or kind gesture delivered to beneficiaries in communities but a complementary role of government through funds received on their behalf by development partners locally and internationally. Speaking on the theme 'Community Mobilization in the Fight against Corruption', the ACC Bo District Coordinator, Mr. Anthony B. Samu said Tikonko Chiefdom should by all means humanly possible join the ACC in the fight against graft. Mr. Samu reiterated the fact that, Local and International NGOs source funding in the name of communities for their development projects; so it should be the business of communities to watch closely how these projects are implemented by these NGOs. He encouraged participants to be proactive in asking salient questions regarding the implementation of programmes and should be involved in the monitoring and evaluation process to enhance quality standards. He told participants that the doors of the commission are always open for such complaints and that there are no sacred cows in the fight against corruption. Highlighting the major offences in the Anti-Corruption Act 2008, Mr. Thomas T. Rogers of the Intelligence, Investigation and Prosecution Department (IIP), explained in precise terms the core offences in the Act that touch individuals in public life on daily basis. Mr. Rogers took a clinical look at these offences and admonished all participants to be mindful of the corresponding penalties associated with them. A minimum of Thirty million Leones or three years imprisonment or both fines and imprisonment will be levied in court against corruption offenders for each of those counts. He therefore implored the people of Tikonko to be free from corruption and should report acts of corruption to the ACC. Questions and answers, distribution of IEC materials and a vote of thanks given by Mary Mattia climaxed the meeting."223,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),11/12/11,Culprits of Corruption Will Face Law - Lubinda,,ZAMBIA (94%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,13-Nov-11,,457 words,CORRUPTION (91%); APPOINTMENTS (89%); CULTURE DEPARTMENTS (78%); GOVERNMENT TOURIST OFFICES (78%); EXECUTIVES (77%) Zambia; Corruption,"INFORMATION, Broadcasting and Tourism Minister Given Lubinda has said people who will be found wanting on corruption in the ongoing investigations would face the wrath of law. And Mr Lubinda has said the appointment of the late former President Frederick Chiluba's spokesperson Emmanuel Mwamba demonstrates that President Michael Sata had embraced even people he considered as foes. Speaking on the Radio Phoenix Friday edition of the programme 'Let the people talk', Mr Lubinda said the Patriotic Front (PF) Government would review the current corruption laws to ensure that they are strengthened. Mr Lubinda said the Government would also soon be reviewing the decision by the previous MMD government to remove section 37 from the Anti Corruption Act. He said the PF Government would lead by example by ensuring that leaders live above board and remain transparent and accountable to the Zambian people. Mr Lubinda who is also chief Government spokesperson said all the Cabinet ministers had made declarations of what they owned. ""Everyone has made declarations, we were given 30 days from the day of appointment to make the declarations,"" he said. Mr Lubinda, however, said there was need to strengthen the laws on declarations so that they are not just fictitious. He said the PF Government was determined to make governance transparent. The minister said there was need to ensure that procurement decisions in Government departments were not made by individuals but groups of people to ensure checks and balances. He said those that would find themselves on the other side of the law in the ongoing investigations would be prosecuted. The minister also said that the media should play a critical role in the fight against corruption by ensuring that they ask critical questions and not just be ""vuvuzelas"" to sing praises for the Government. He said society should also shame people who are corrupt. ""Do not hero worship corrupt individuals, it is not like we do not know the people who are corrupt,"" he said. And during the same programme Mr Lubinda said the appointment of Mr Mwamba as permanent secretary for the Northern Province demonstrates that he could appoint even people who condemned and worked against the PF. Mr Lubinda also refutes insinuations that President Sata had only appointed people from one region. Transparency International Zambia (TIZ) president Reuben Lifuka, however, was against the appointment of Mr Mwamba as Northern Province Permanent Secretary. SACCORD executive director Lee Habasonda said the President should avoid making appointments that sent wrong signals.vMeanwhile Mr Lubinda has said the media should proceed and launch the Zambia Independent Media Council (ZAMEC) so that they can regulate themselves."224,Concord Times (Freetown),11/16/11,ACC Presents New National Anti- Corruption Strategy (2011-2013),,SIERRA LEONE (94%),Newspaper,Ibrahim Jaffa Condeh,ENGLISH,,,17-Nov-11,,288 words,CORRUPTION (94%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%); BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (78%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (78%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (71%) Sierra Leone; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Governance,"The Anti- Corruption Commission (ACC) yesterday presented the Revised National Anti- Corruption Strategy for 2011-2013 before a cross section of government functionaries at the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED) main conference hall in Freetown. Chairperson of the programme, Lavina Banduah, said it is the duty of all Sierra Leoneans to fight against corruption, describing corruption as a menace to the progress of development adding that: ""We want to see that the society is free from all forms of corruption as the public is doing all what it takes to fight against corruption."" Commissioner of the Anti- Corruption Commission Joseph Fitzgerald Kamara said the purpose of the revised strategy was to determine a midterm review of the fight against corruption. He noted that the commission was set up in 2000 to address cases of corrupt practices and most cases that were filed in court but not well adhered to. He said the commission is grateful to the president and the parliament for their support in helping to prosecute cases of corruption. The commission has engaged in meetings with NGOs and young people in schools to be effective and engage clean hard work, he said. We need to create a national task force against corruption that will also help man affairs against corruption though we have engaged more than a thousand community based organizations. ""The commission is grateful to the UNDP for their tireless assistance and we want to extend our gratitude for the good work they have been doing,"" he said. Director of NACS, Nabilahi Kamara, who did the presentation, said the NCSA is Sierra Leone's roadmap in the fight against corruption and its approach to building strong public and private sector."225,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),11/21/11,Corruption Fight - Just How Much Political Commitment Is Required?,,ZAMBIA (97%),Newspaper,Bob Sianjalika,ENGLISH,,,21-Nov-11,,1366 words,CORRUPTION (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (79%); POLITICS (78%); POOR POPULATION (77%); WEALTH MANAGEMENT (77%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (67%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (60%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (57%) Zambia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"CORRUPTION should be fought because it frustrates every genuine effort and robs the nationals of their privileges. Does every politician agree that the fight against corruption should be non-selective and ruthless especially in a county like Zambia where poverty levels remain high? There are many ways of getting wealth in this world but certainly not through dubious means. Many Zambians today have fought hard to acquire their wealth through hard work and endurance to invest prudently. This is a means that should be admired and adored. The other means of getting wealth can be through inheritance of family estates. Although this could be deemed a benefit from a misfortune, there is morally nothing wrong with it as long as one manages to run the fortune prudently. Such is life as death is inevitable. Sadly some people are thriving on corruption to enrich themselves. These are people that feel that it's not necessary to work hard. Corruption is a menace and should never be tolerated. Be it at among politicians, faith leaders and civil society organisations, the vice is totally wrong and detrimental to society. Zambia is a victim of this corruption in so many ways. It is the hope of all well meaning individuals that this vice should always be fought. But is the nation seeing this willingness from everyone? This fight should not be for those in government alone. It should not be looked at as a fight between President Michael Sata and others or maybe the Transparency International Zambia (TIZ) versus others. It should be a natural responsibility that each Zambian volunteers to carry and show the rest of the world that wealth creation comes through hard work and not disadvantaging other natives through corruption. President Michael Sata has launched a gruesome anti corruption crusade. There are several people in Zambia that benefited either directly or indirectly from corrupt activities. These people may not be happy with maneuvers by the President to sweep the country clean of corruption. They will protest in so many ways. Their protests may take days, months or years but every Zambian's prayer is that such protests should not succeed. What is required is to ensure that the fight against corruption is amplified by all. The zeal from the civil society should be massive and clear. Leaving this fight to law enforcement agencies can not be enough. It is indeed a complex fight that should be tackled ruthlessly but lawfully to the conclusive end. Just like the late President Levy Mwanawasa lost friends, relatives and indeed political allies over his corruption fight, Mr Sata should equally not relent. Criminals are tactful and deceitful. They may befriend authorities just to blind them. This is the time to look out for such wrong people who would always want to claim innocence when actually their rightful tag is criminal. Just upon being sworn-in as Zambia's 5th republican President Mr Sata made a commitment to the world that he would fight corruption as a means of ensuring lives of Zambians are promoted and secured from poverty. He declared that 'I'm allergic to corruption' and that he would not sit idle and watch such vices go on. The phenomenon of being allergic to corruption should not only be with the President but in all Zambians. The poverty Zambia faces today is to a larger extent because of corruption. As an immediate measure to curb this vice, Mr Sata said he would strengthen anti-corruption laws by putting back on the books the offence of abuse of office, which the previous government had removed. ""We will investigate acts of corruption by the previous government. Our country needs a new beginning. ""If found wanting, you will be prosecuted regardless of your status. I want to sound a timely warning that this government has taken a zero stance to corruption,"" he said. It still remains unclear as to why the abuse of office clause was scrapped by the previous government So far Mr Sata has won support of various international and local stakeholders over his stance on corruption. He has said what people want to hear and he so far seems committed to it. Even bilateral partners such as Britain, Germany, China and many more openly came out in support of his stance. This is a key step in the governance system of the country and it is only the political will that can get the other sectors of the economy to respond to such a well intended crusade. British High Commissioner to Zambia Tom Carter believes that Britain has always been willing to render assistance to Zambian in the fight against corruption and improvement of the governance system. Even with the PF government, the British Government has committed itself to assist in curbing corruption. According to Mr Carter corruption derails national development and that meaningful sustainable development can be achieved if it is wiped out. Not long ago, some European Community members including Britain backed the fight against corruption during the late Dr Mwanawasa's reign. This even saw the formation of the Task Force against Corruption whose headquarters was in Lusaka. The taskforce composed of skilled men and women from the Drug Enforcement Commission, the Anti Corruption Commission, and the Zambia Police Service. Others were lawyers like Mutembo Nchito and Nchima Nchito who were equally engaged to ensure that the crusade bore fruits. Sadly, and regrettably this effort didn't yield much as the task force was disbanded shortly after the death of Dr Mwanawasa in 2008. But are Zambians going to see a similar splendid fight against corruption this time around? This is everyone's wish. The reinvigorated fight against corruption under the PF government will capitalise on the past experiences. Fortunately people like former Task Force chairperson Maxwell Nkole are still around and now holding senior government positions as Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs. Definitely, the latest teams of investigators into allegations of corruption know where the previous crop went strong. They will now have the capacity to compare and improve upon such ineptitude. The investigators will also take advantage of the reports to come from the many commissions of inquiry set by the President Sata. Mr Sata has appointed a commission to investigate operations at the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA), Zamtel, and another commission to investigate transactions at the Zambia National Building Society (ZNBS). The president has also request for a report on the reversed sale of Finance Bank to foreign bank where he suspected fraud and corruption to have marred the whole transaction. So far, just from the few directives that Mr Sata has made the work of the investigators would be made easier. Naturally, the fight against corruption has received mass criticism from some sectors of society The Alliance for Development and Democracy (ADD) has supported Mr Michael Sata's commitment to fighting corruption saying it will help improve the living standards of Zambians. The ADD president Charles Milupi said his party campaigned on the basis of eradicating corruption in Zambia and would still support any such efforts even if it is not in government. What is puzzling is the amount of criticism coming from some opposition political parties over the corruption crusade but without offering tangible, substantiated or corresponding counter claims to their positions. Realistically it should not matter who or which party is in government for a country to effectively curb corruption. The spirit should be that of unity of purpose, aimed at attaining one simple goal of improving Zambia's governance system through prudent means of acquiring opportunities for all deserving citizens. If there are critical issues that the other stakeholders have against the PF government, there is still room to open dialogue and just present such concerns formally. Mr Sata appears willing to listen to advice that is well meaning. Criticism is important in a democracy and should be encouraged. However constructive criticism is most preferred and people should not be scared to criticise or air their views on issues they are not happy with. For now its time to build consensus in this corruption fight."226,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),11/22/11,'Corruption Making Business Costly',,ZAMBIA (93%); AUSTRIA (92%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,22-Nov-11,,344 words,MINES & MINING (91%); CORRUPTION (89%); BUSINESS & PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS (89%); GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (78%); ECONOMIC NEWS (78%); COPPER MINING (78%); TRADE DEVELOPMENT (77%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (76%); LIVING STANDARDS (75%); CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE (73%); HOTELS & MOTELS (56%) Zambia; Corruption; Mining,"THE government will not tolerate corruption in the mining and other business sectors because the vice is making the cost of doing business high in the country. Commerce, Trade and Industry Bob Sichinga said there was need to stamp out corruption in the mining industry if the country was to develop on a sustainable basis. The minister was speaking when he addressed the Copperbelt business community at Moba Hotel in Kitwe yesterday. ""We will not entertain corruption in the mining industry, especially that mining is the mainstay of the country's economy. Corruption in the mining industry is further adding to the cost of doing business,"" Mr Sichinga said. The Minister said the Government recently engaged Mopani Copper Mines (MCM) officials who complained that a number of suppliers were conniving with its employees to over-invoice goods or services. He said the mine had argued that local suppliers were not adding value to their products. He therefore challenged the Mine Suppliers and contractors Association (MSCAZ) to ensure that corruption was eliminated among its membership. And Mr Sichinga was saddened that the 7.6 Growth Domestic Product (GDP) was not flowing to the Zambian citizens. He said benefits must flow not only to the top mining companies but to ordinary Zambians. Mr Sichinga said the Government was working hard to ensure that the cost of doing business was reduced and standards of living improved. He said the Government was seeking partnership with Austrian Investors who had put together a total of 1.5 billion Austrian dollars which would be committed to various infrastructure among them the road network. Speaking earlier Kitwe District Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KDCCI) chairperson Raj Karamuchand said the business sector was adversely affected by corruption, which he said was contributing to increased costs of doing business. He urged the Government to strengthen the institutions fighting corruption on its behalf. ""A businessman's cost are increased by having to pay corruption officials in order to survive,"" Mr Karamuchand said."227,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),11/23/11,Local Court Magistrate Denies Corruption Charge,,ZAMBIA (93%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,23-Nov-11,,294 words,MAGISTRATES (97%); CORRUPTION (92%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (90%); CRIMINAL LAW (78%); SENTENCING (78%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (78%); LITIGATION (78%); ARRESTS (78%); JAIL SENTENCING (73%); LARCENY & THEFT (72%) Zambia; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"A SENIOR Local Court magistrate yesterday pleaded not guilty to allegations of corrupt practices in a Kitwe magistrate's court. Joyce Chikolwa, 38, of 109 Kantanta Street, Nkana East, is charged with one count of corrupt practices by a public officer contrary to sections 19(1) and 40 of the Anti-Corruption Act number 38 of 2010. Particulars of the offence are that on October 4 this year, Chikolwa, being a Local Court magistrate, did corruptly solicit for and received K1, 500,000 cash from Alice Chisembele. It was alleged that Chikolwa received the money as an inducement or reward to review the judgment in a Local Court case between John Chisembele and Catherine Nakamba, a matter of transaction that concerned the Local Court, a public body. Chikolwa denied the charge before Principal Resident Magistrate Penjani Lamba where she took a fresh plea. She earlier appeared before Magistrate Densen Muchamba who, however, recused himself from handling the matter. The matter comes up on December 20 and January 16 for mention while trial has been set for February 6 next year.

ACC director Paulus Noa said this yesterday when speaking at the launch of the Institute of Policy Research (IPPR) anti-corruption research programme title 'The ACC in Action: What Does The Track Record Say?' The research reviewed the work of the graft fighting body over the past five years since its establishment. IPPR urged the ACC do more to fulfil its mandate in terms of preventing corruption and educating the public on corruption according to the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). Noa said investigating corruption as a crime is very different from murder or rape, as corruption leaves very little evidence, if any, behind for investigators. He also said that individuals cannot be convicted just on the basis of newspaper reports, adding that corruption cases are often the most difficult to investigate. In terms of the ACC's record, from 2006/2007 to 2008/2009 the ACC received 2 514 reports of alleged corrupt practices of which 268 were pursuable according to the IPPR. This means that approximately 10 per cent of total reports received were pursuable. Ellison Tjirera, one of the authors of the latest IPPR report, said that this was an indication that a large portion of the public was not educated on what constitutes corrupt practices, and as a result bring frivolous reports to the ACC. To this end the IPPR have recommended that the ACC expand its public education efforts country wide to improve public knowledge on what constitutes corrupt practices. From 2006 to 2010, the ACC submitted 262 cases to the Prosecutor General for prosecution, however only 38 have resulted in successful convictions. Over the same period of time there have been 15 acquittals, and the Prosecutor General has declined to prosecute in 36 cases. More than half (151) of the cases submitted to the Prosecutor General are in court awaiting trial, and the IPPR regards this as evidence of an inefficient court system in Namibia. IPPR director Graham Hopwood said that data and indicators on the fight against corruption have been reviewed in the research paper and that the IPPR had also made some recommendations to the ACC to enhance its credibility and gain public support. Hopwood said that early impressions and beliefs were that the ACC would be effective in fighting corruption, noting that many similar institutions enjoy a ""honeymoon period"" in terms of public perception but that there was a tendency for this to fall away over time. The IPPR recommended that the ACC fast tracks the setting up of its directorate of Corruption Prevention ""which would be dedicated to researching systems practices and procedures that will best enable Namibia to reduce corruption"". It is also recommended that the ACC 'name and shame' those prosecuted and convicted of corrupt practices."229,The New Times (Kigali),11/26/11,"Shun Corruption, Dr Sezibera Urges",,"RWANDA (94%); EASTERN AFRICA (94%); BURUNDI (93%); UGANDA (92%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (92%); KENYA (92%); AFRICA (79%)",Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,28-Nov-11,"BUJUMBURA, BURUNDI (92%)",333 words,CORRUPTION (95%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (89%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (78%); INTERVIEWS (78%); BRIBERY (73%); TARIFFS & DUTIES (69%); RANKINGS (69%); NONTARIFF BARRIERS (53%) Rwanda; Corruption,"The East African Community (EAC) Secretary General, Dr Richard Sezibera, has cautioned regional member states over persistent corruption cases, saying that unless much effort is exerted in purging the vice, the region will remain underdeveloped. In interview with reporters from the region held yesterday in Bujumbura, Burundi, Sezibera said fighting corruption should not be left to government officials only but citizens should also play a part. ""Corruption is a problem. Fighting corruption is much more than laws and all these agencies and institutions. It should be a culture people must say no to,"" he said. The latest East African Bribery Index 2011 ranked Burundi as the most corrupt nation with a score 37.9 percent, both Uganda and Tanzania stood at 33.9 percent, and Kenya recorded a slight improvement at 28.8 percent, down from 31.9 percent in 2010. while Rwanda scored 5.1 percent, down from 6.6 percent last year. Rwandan traders recently complained of rampant corruption and non tariff barriers in other EAC member states, which they believe, has not only affected their businesses, but also dogged regional integration. In 2007, the East Africa Association of the Anti corruption Authority (EAAACA) was formed to promote the spirit of zero tolerance on corruption and encourage regional cooperation in preventing and combating the vice, but its efforts are yet to bear fruit. According to traders, due to graft, larger competitors from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania are able to sell their products in Rwanda at lower prices, despite associated transport costs as they enjoy the benefits of economies of scale on top of incurring lower production costs. ""You cannot develop a country with corruption...it's something we need to fight as regional citizens for the benefit of our community,"" Sezibera noted. He further tipped regional media practitioners on the essence of collaboration with civil societies and other stakeholders to highlight the most corrupt officials as a means of fighting graft."230,The Namibian (Windhoek),12/1/11,Corruption Laws Under Attack,,NAMIBIA (94%),Newspaper,Werner Menges,ENGLISH,,,1-Dec-11,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (90%)",759 words,CORRUPTION (94%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (91%); CRIME PREVENTION (90%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (90%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); LAWYERS (78%); CONSTITUTIONAL LAW (78%); APPOINTMENTS (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); MONEY LAUNDERING (73%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE Anti-Corruption Act, the Prevention of Organised Crime Act, and the dual appointment of Pendukeni Iivula-Ithana as Justice Minister and Attorney General in 2005 all came under attack in the High Court in Windhoek yesterday. In a case heard by a full bench of the High Court, fraud and money-laundering suspects Teckla Lameck and Kongo Mokaxwa want the court to declare Iivula-Ithana's dual appointment as contrary to the Constitution, to declare that the Prevention of Organised Crime Act did not legally come into operation on May 5 2009, and to declare key sections of that law and the Anti-Corruption Act unconstitutional. If Lameck and Mokaxwa succeed with the case, it will have a far-reaching effect on two of the main legal weapons in Namibia's arsenal for the fight against corruption and organised crime. Judges Elton Hoff and Dave Smuts and Acting Judge Kobus Miller, who heard the case, reserved judgement after hearing arguments from senior counsel Jeremy Gauntlett, representing Lameck and Mokaxwa, and Wim Trengove, the senior counsel representing the President, the Minister of Justice, the Attorney General, the Prosecutor General and the Director of the Anti-Corruption Commission. Gauntlett argued that the Constitution, which provides for the appointment of an Attorney General whose functions include being the principal legal advisor to the President and Government, expressly contemplates a dedicated government legal advisor. The appointment of the same person as both Attorney General and Justice Minister weakens the separate offices and the capacity to perform the offices' different roles under the Constitution, he argued. Because - according to this argument - Iivula-Ithana cannot hold both posts in terms of the Constitution, she could also not have issued the Government Notice in which May 5 2009 was set as the date on which POCA came into operation, Gauntlett argued. If that is accepted, POCA has never legally come into operation. Trengove argued that there is nothing in the Constitution to indicate that it is not permissible for the Attorney General to also be a member of the Cabinet, or that a person cannot at the same time serve as Attorney General and as a minister holding another portfolio. There is no reason to suggest that the Minister of Justice was wrongly appointed when President Hifikepunye Pohamba announced Iivula-Ithana's appointment in that post in March 2005, he argued. One of the main challenges to the constitutionality of POCA is directed at that law's provision that it also covers ""unlawful activities"" that took place before the Act came into operation. Such a provision that makes the Act operate retroactively ""is patently unconstitutional"", Lameck claims in an affidavit filed with the court. She states: ""(T)he retrospective effect of the definitions 'unlawful activity' and 'proceeds of unlawful activities' has the potential of criminalising activity which was not an offence at the time it was committed, and make property which was previously legally obtained (...) subject to confiscation."" Trengove's response to this was to argue that with a proper interpretation of POCA it is apparent that crimes committed before the law came into operation would not trigger the asset confiscation and forfeiture mechanisms which the Act created. The entire purpose of POCA is not to punish people for their crimes, but rather to strip criminals of the benefits derived from crime, he said. Lameck and Mokaxwa are also attacking the Anti-Corruption Act's definition of the term ""corruptly"" as being unreasonable, vague and too wide. The Act defines ""corruptly"" as meaning ""in contravention of or against the spirit of any law, provision, rule, procedure, process, system, policy, practice, directive, order or any other term or condition pertaining to any employment relationship; any agreement; or the performance of any function in whatever capacity"". Trengove told the judges that he agreed that broad terms were used in the definition of ""corruptly"". However, he said, the definition was an attempt to capture a concept which in the first place is an elusive one. Lameck, Mokaxwa and Chinese national Yang Fan are facing charges over an alleged corrupt deal in which Chinese-made security scanning equipment was bought by the Ministry of Finance in 2008. It is alleged that the price of the equipment was inflated to enable the manufacturer of the equipment, Nuctech, represented by Yang, to pay a ""commission"" of at least US$12,828 million to Teko Trading, a close corporation of Lameck and Mokaxwa."231,The Namibian (Windhoek),12/2/11,State Struggles to Shed Corruption Label,,"NAMIBIA (94%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (79%); FINLAND (66%); DENMARK (52%)",Newspaper,Jo-Mar_ Duddy,ENGLISH,,,2-Dec-11,,257 words,CORRUPTION (92%); RANKINGS (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (73%); TRENDS (70%) Namibia; Corruption,"NAMIBIA is regarded as the second least corrupt country in the region, Transparency International's latest Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) showed yesterday. However, it has been unable to shed its reputation as highly corrupt in the eyes of the world, retaining its 2010 score of 4,4 out of ten. Any country scoring less than five points is perceived as ""highly corrupt"" by the global watchdog for domestic and public sector graft. Namibia's latest score is a slight drop from the 4,5 it achieved in the 2008 and 2009 surveys. Transparency International (TI) ranked Namibia 57th out of 183 economies this year. Last year, Namibia held the 56th spot out of 178 countries, while in 2009, it was 56th out of 180 economies. In 2008 it held the 61st position, compared to the 57th spot in 2007. The recent trend is a far cry from the period of 1998 to 2002, when Namibia was continuously ranked amongst the top 30 least corrupt countries in the world. Although Namibia's 2011 score is better than its all-time low of 4,1 points from 2004 to 2006, it is a drastic drop from its record-high of 5,7 points in 2002. New Zealand, with a score of 9,5, came out tops in this year's ranking. It was followed by Denmark and Finland, both with 9,4. Globally, war-torn Somalia and North Korea were joint bottom of the list, perceived to be the world's most corrupt countries, with a score of 1,0. Compiling its yearly CPI, TI uses data from 17 surveys that look at factors such as enforcement of anti-corruption laws, access to information and conflicts of interest."232,The New Times (Kigali),12/3/11,60 Riders Sign-Up for Anti-Corruption Race,,RWANDA (76%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,3-Dec-11,,89 words,SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); CYCLING (90%) Rwanda; Corruption,"OVER 60 riders from nine clubs are expected to take part in the inaugural Anti-Corruption cycling competition this Sunday.

Placing fourth least corrupt in Africa and 49th worldwide, with a score of 5.0 out of 10, is no mean feat for a country that languished in 111th position out of 178 countries, with a paltry score of 2.8, as recently as 2007. It is an achievement built upon years of solid work and consistency, through the application of appropriate legal framework and procedures, as well as establishment and empowerment of institutions designed to fight graft. Many bold decisions were taken to ensure a paradigm shift in matters of public accountability and ownership. From Rwanda's experience, it is clear that one of the main deterrence is punishing the corrupt, regardless of their position and status, as this sends out a strong message to the rest of the public. It may be difficult to totally rid society of any corrupt tendencies, but keeping the momentum against the vice should remain a top priority. The annual Auditor General's reports, easily demonstrate why the anti-corruption crusade must not lose steam. Taxpayers need value for every single penny that leaves the public coffers. They have seen the benefits of fiscal transparency and public accountability and will not tire in demanding more vigilance to ensure that government remains as clean and open as possible. While we must appreciate the commendable progress we have made as a nation, we must not be complacent, let's stay the course."234,The Namibian (Windhoek),12/6/11,"Corruption Bigger Than Crime, Fraud",,NAMIBIA (96%),Newspaper,Jo-Mar Duddy,ENGLISH,,,6-Dec-11,,592 words,CORRUPTION (93%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (92%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (90%); DEVELOPMENT BANKS (90%); BRIBERY (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (89%); WEALTHY PEOPLE (89%); PRIVATIZATION (79%); PUBLIC FINANCE (79%); EMBEZZLEMENT (78%); BANKING & FINANCE (78%); MONEY LAUNDERING (78%); PENSION FUNDS (77%); LUXURY GOODS (77%); RESEARCH REPORTS (76%); LOBBYING (74%); SOCIAL SECURITY (72%); US SOCIAL SECURITY (72%); RANKINGS (69%); ENTOMOLOGY (68%) Namibia; Corruption,"GOVERNMENT corruption is a bigger problem than any other form of organised crime and fraud in Namibia, the World Bank has said. At least ""tens of millions of dollars"", pocketed through dubious tendering, illegal issuing of licences, bribery, kickbacks and investment schemes, finance lifestyles and pay for luxury items such as cars and apartments in Swakopmund or Cape Town, it said. The report echoes the findings of the latest Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), which showed that Namibia remains ""highly corrupt"" in the eyes of the world. Transparency International's 2011 CPI placed Namibia 57th out of 183 economies, a far cry from the period of 1998 to 2002, when the country was continuously ranked among the top 30 least corrupt countries. A lack of hard data makes it hard to put a price tag on corruption, the World Bank said. However, the ""embezzlement of government funds and fraud with public money has increased dramatically in recent years"". The findings are contained in a new study, 'Ill-gotten Money and the Economy: Experiences from Malawi and Namibia'. The World Bank sent a research team to Namibia last November and this February to interview Government, the private sector, academics and civil society on the matter. The report was compiled in collaboration with the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) at the Bank of Namibia (BoN). The World Bank concluded: ""High-end corruption in Namibia involves tens of millions of dollars at a minimum."" The World Bank said corruption and alleged corruption cases vary from a few million to N$30 million through the Social Security Commission/Avid scandal, N$100 million via the Offshore Development Corporation (ODC) and about N$1,8 billion through the Government Institutions Pension Fund's (GIPF) Development Capital Portfolio (DCP). ""Many observers consider the influential role of one party to be one of the root causes of present-day concerns of corruption in Namibia,"" the study said. According to the World Bank, privatisation has strengthened the relationship between the business class and the political elite. ""Many black economic empowerment managers have become business tycoons, and are influencing parliamentary decisions and lobbying for legislation that will ultimately secure their wealth,"" the study said. BEE remains a ""highly debated"" topic in Namibia and is perceived as ""creating economic distortions"", it said. Although Namibia's legal and institutional framework for curbing corruption generally received the thumbs-up, there are insufficient controls and loopholes, especially in the tendering process, the World Bank said. The report also addresses money laundering within and across the territorial borders of Namibia. ""Namibia is considered to be highly vulnerable to the inflow of proceeds of crime and corruption from other jurisdictions [countries],"" the report warns. The World Bank in particular mentions Namibia being a neighbour to South Africa and Angola, countries regarded to have ""large and thriving criminal"" classes. Angolans, the report continues, spend large amounts of money in the Namibian economy ""doing business, driving up real estate prices, outbidding Namibian entrepreneurs"". Angolans and other nationals are known to be buying luxury and middle-income houses for cash and have been accused of driving up property prices. Namibians interviewed by the World Bank for the report observed that many well-to-do Angolans coming with cash to Namibia have benefitted directly and indirectly from the Angolan oil boom and very fast economic growth over the past decade."235,The New Times (Kigali),12/6/11,Hategeka Wins Anti-Corruption Cycling Tourney,,RWANDA (59%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,6-Dec-11,,111 words,CYCLING (91%); SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (90%); TOURNAMENTS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%) Rwanda; Sport,"GASORE Hategeka showed incredible power ad determination after winning the Anti-corruption cycling tour on Sunday afternoon.

The prosecutions were based on the Auditor Generals (AG) reports from 2007 to 2009. The jail terms incurred by the individuals ranged from one to ten years imprisonment. This was disclosed in a report released by the NPPA, containing the names of individuals who had lost corruption cases. The report reveals that the Prosecution forwarded, to the Justice Ministry, a list of 63 dossiers worth over Rwf 2.7 billion, 660,000 Euros and US $5,855 as well as other non-financial assets to be recovered. ""We have been following up on the Auditor General's report since 2007,"" Prosecutor General Martin Ngoga said. The majority of the individuals on the list are government officials as well as financial controllers who embezzled, failed to account or misappropriated funds, flouted tender and procurement procedures or failed to deliver good account books. ""We have been investigating and systematically following up these cases so that we don't miss out anything the Auditor General pointed out"", Ngoga said. Prominent among the cases cited by the NPPA are instances of government officials diverting public funds for personal reasons as well as officials stealing materials for the implementation of government programmes such as iron sheets, fertilisers and cement. The Prosecutor General commended the NPPA's Economic Crimes Department for following up on the cases despite the challenges it faced. He, however, expressed concern that the department, which was established in 2007 and currently has 21 prosecutors, did not have enough capacity to follow up all the cases highlighted in the AG's report. He stated that the prosecutors have to follow up cases in and outside the country including in all embassies and he cited the biggest challenge being government employees getting transferred to other institutions or even quitting, making it difficult to locate them. The Coordinator of the Economic Crimes Department, Jules Marius Ntete, told The New Times that the NPPA will embark on the 2010 Auditors General Report by February 2012 because it is still handling a backlog of cases. The AG's most recent report highlighted some Rwf 9.7bn that has not been properly accounted for. The NPPA has opened 265 cases between 2007 to 2010 based on the findings of the Auditor General's report. Reacting recently on the recovery process, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Justice, Pascal Bizimana Rugemitwari, said that they were undertaking a recovery process in collaboration with the Prosecution, the Supreme Court and the Ombudsman's office. He said they will send a list of names of the wanted individuals to the Department of Immigration, banks and other service points to ensure that the culprits don't evade justice."237,The New Times (Kigali),12/9/11,Corruption Watchdog Warns Local Leaders Against Graft,,RWANDA (93%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,9-Dec-11,,166 words,BRIBERY (90%); CORRUPTION (90%) Rwanda; Corruption,"The chairperson of Transparency Rwanda, Immaculee Ingabire, has cautioned local leaders in Gicumbi District against soliciting bribes from residents seeking services.

""A gathering such as this offers the unique opportunities to share experiences and best practices in preventing and combating corruption and economic crime in the region. Those of us with responsibility to prevent and combat such crimes must adopt appropriate strategies to deal effectively with the perpetrators and proceeds of corruption,"" he said.

ACC director Paulus Noa confirmed on Friday that they had received a copy of the case record containing an affidavit by Zimbabwean national Goodhope Chibika, and are investigating the conduct of senior immigration official Claudia Shilunga. Chibika, a teacher at Windhoek's Jakob Marengo Secondary School, was arrested in the early hours of November 10 and driven to Seeis Police Station east of Windhoek. According to Chibika, Shilunga had threatened to have him arrested and prosecuted for allegedly working in Namibia without a work permit. Chibika claimed Shilunga started threatening him after she had her car repaired at his garage and its immobiliser was lost in the workshop. Chibika says he agreed to pay Shilunga N$12 250 to have the immobiliser replaced, but she was not satisfied with his payments and visited the school where he teaches to warn the principal that Chibika would be arrested for working in Namibia illegally. Chibika obtained an urgent release order from the Windhoek High Court on the day of his arrest, with Acting Judge Andrew Corbett ruling that Shilunga should pay Chibika's legal costs. Chibika's lawyer, Norman Tjombe, told the court that the manner in which his client was arrested was an example of ""blatant corruption"" and an ""abuse of statutory powers for personal gain."" The matter was heard by Acting Judge Corbett for a second time on November 29, when he ordered that the Registrar of the High Court should provide a copy of the case record to the ACC for the matter to be investigated. Noa said ACC investigation would aim to determine whether Chibika's had been arrested because he is an illegal immigrant or due to bad blood between himself and Shilunga. Chibika married a Namibian citizen in 2004, and argues that he has been legally domiciled in Namibia since then, although his wife has since died. In terms of the Immigration Control Act, being domiciled in Namibia means that does not require a work or residence permit to legally live and work in the country, Chibika says."240,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),12/13/11,"Corruption, a setback for Implementing Country's MDG's - Permanent Secretary",,ZAMBIA (94%),Newspaper,Gideon Thole,ENGLISH,,,13-Dec-11,,226 words,CORRUPTION (97%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (73%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (68%) Zambia; Corruption; Sustainable Development; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"LUPAULA Province Permanent Secretary Gabriel Kaunda has said the  effects of corruption are jeopardising Zambia's chances of attaining the  Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

Concluding his policy statement on estimates for his ministry in Parliament yesterday, Mr Yaluma regretted that corruption was rife especially in the issuance of title deeds and allocation of plots. ""My ministry is perceived to be corrupt and I agree with this perception but we have got to eliminate corruption. I have tried to prove a point by having a title deed processed within two weeks and yet the same process in many other cases takes two years. ""We therefore need to have a value chain process so that we can monitor the title deed issuance and track down corrupt elements in the process and deal with them,"" he said. The minister said he was frustrated that the process of title deeds issuance took unnecessarily long because of corrupt officers at his ministry. He noted that it was frustrating for people to travel long distances to Lusaka to process their title deeds. ""As a ministry, we are seriously considering decentralising the process so it can be done at provincial level. ""You can imagine that I have got pending applications for titles deeds of 2001 in my office, which is unacceptable. Let us, therefore, work together and expose issues of bribes so that we can decisively deal with culprits,"" he said. Mr Yaluma during the same debate reiterated the PF Government's commitment to boosting the energy sector in Zambia started by the defeated MMD regime. Earlier, Chongwe Member of Parliament (MP) Sylvia Masebo (PF) said corruption at the Ministry of Lands was rampant, that was why at some point late president Levy Mwanawasa closed it to pave way for investigations. ""Some amount of change was seen as a result of this action by Dr Mwanawasa and I am, therefore, urging the minister to clean up this ministry. In the last three years we saw a total diversion from good governance,"" she said. Choma MP, Cornelius Mweetwa (UPND) urged the minister to decentralise the issuance of title deeds to provincial centres. Mr Mweetwa called on the Government to increase staff levels so that service delivery could be enhanced at the Ministry of Lands. Namwala MP, Lubezhi Moono (UPND) said the high prices of fuel obtaining in Zambia negated efforts of growing the economy. Chavuma MP, Kenneth Konga (MMD) in his debate stressed that the energy sector was a critical component to the social and economic development of Zambia. Mr Konga noted that aspects of mining, agriculture and industries all hinged on the availability of energy and he was impressed that the PF Government had increased allocations to the sector. Justice Minister Sebastian Zulu told Parliament that the Government would ensure that corruption was eradicated. In presenting estimates for the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), Mr Zulu said the Government was serious about fighting corruption and that was why it would re-introduce Article 37 which was struck out from the ACC Act by the MMD regime. ""The PF campaigned on the platform of fighting corruption and in view of this we shall reinstate the repealed Section 37 of the ACC Act in its totality. The fight against corruption requires vibrancy and concerted efforts by all institutions and citizens,"" he said. Mr Zulu who was also acting leader of Government business in the House said the Government would support ACC through the national Anti-Corruption Policy.

Indeed, upon his accession to power, President Ernest Bai Koroma assured the people of this country that his government will vigorously pursue the fight against corruption noting that in the regime's drive against corruption and to achieve zero tolerance to corruption there will be no 'sacred-cows', not even members of his own family. Controversy is brewing in many quarters about the seriousness that the All People's Congress (APC) party government had committed to the anti-corruption objective given that statistics show that despite the president's determination to minimize corruption, the pandemic remains endemic in every fabric of the Sierra Leonean society. A long pro-APC regime article written by Kabs-Kanu in the USA published in the 14th December 2011 edition of the Independent Observer put to rest government's unrelenting determination by creating the impression that President Koroma is very serious about his determination to eradicate corruption in Sierra Leone. This is a far cry from what a letter that the flag-bearer of the opposition Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP) Julius Maada Bio tried to portray in the widely read London-based Guardian newspaper recently. In the letter, the retired brigadier hinted that corruption is still rampant in almost every segment of the society especially in the area of education, the economy and democratic reforms. The SLPP presidential candidate also cited the timbergate corruption scandal involving the Vice President Alhaji Sahr Sam-Sumana recently exposed in a documentary of the Aljazeera international television as an example. The timbergate scandal or the logging trade monopoly is today a serious embarrassment to the APC government. The scale of humiliation is probably on the same magnitude with the drug trafficking scandal few years ago, in which the first minister of transport and aviation of the President Koroma-led APC regime, Hon. Kemoh Sesay, was implicated. In the case of the drug trafficking scandal, the government tried by every means to claim its direct involvement by ensuring that justice takes its course through the law court with the involvement of international agencies that monitor drug trafficking in the world such as the International Police (INTERPOL). At the end of the trial, government's show of cooperation with the prosecution and other signs became quite evident that the APC regime was innocent except that corrupt individuals working for the government had hidden-hands in the drug trade. What is certain today is that the APC government appears to be divided over whether to cover the reputation of the hardworking Vice President. The issue was at first bitterly criticized by certain pro-APC newspapers and propagandists some of which established the impression that the Aljazeera story is a set-up meant to tarnish the good image of the APC government thereby reduce their chances for re-election in the coming 2012 elections. Some government officials even toyed around with the idea of taking international legal actions against Aljazeera's documentary while labelling journalist Sorious Samura who presented the documentary as a paid-up traitor on the payroll of the detractors of the Vice President. Today, after giving a second thought to the entire affair, government's official spokesman, the Minister of Information and Communication I.B. Kargbo is even mumbling about the possibility of the VP being asked to relinquish his function for the sake of the good governance initiative. The agitations for the VPs resignation appear to have gained added dimensions as a group of American congressmen presented a position statement cautioning the resignation of the Vice President. The SLPP presidential candidate came out plain in that letter by urging those ""holding influence with the current administration such as ex-British Prime Minister Tony Blair to caution the APC government to reverse their actions by repudiating all anti-democratic measures and by being honest about the Koroma regime's record in government. The UK which supplies 60% of the Sierra Leonean government's budget through aid must demand change,"" Maada Bio wrote. What is logical about the SLPP leader's letter is that it did not fail to mention that there are serious challenges ahead. There are many who feel that education in Sierra Leone has seriously declined in standards that tempted it to be labelled as 'The Athens of West Africa' because many issues have been compromised. There are fears in the horizon that very soon, commercial banks may start rationing payment of customer's deposits. Strike action looms over the educational system for salary arrears in the primary, secondary and tertiary institutions of the educational system while threats of the exchange rate to foreign currencies especially the British pound and the U.S dollar as well as monetary inflation is pushing shockwaves into the economic sector. One point hammered out in Maada Bio's letter is that efforts must be made to ensure that there is a transparent political process although there are pessimistic signs that the ghosts of the past election may return to manipulate the fair elections that Sierra Leoneans deserve as a basic human right while expressing the hope that all parties should work together to ensure that the transfer of power is peaceful. ""It is something that the British government bravely advocated in the year 2000 and over a decade later we must not let that intervention be in vain."" What Maada Bio appears to be stating is that it should be the unwavering determination of every stakeholder in the electoral process to ensure an honest, transparent and accountable process and one reason that may ignite rays of hope is that over five years at the helm of the National Electoral Commission (NEC), Dr Christiana Thorpe may have by now learnt enough lessons and experience that may enable her not to repeat the errors of the past. In the coming 2012 presidential and parliamentary elections, draconian measures should be taken to ensure that polling stations in the country and the NEC election supervisors and monitors do not possess ballots in excess of the number of registered voters in a given constituency. In the words of the SLPP leader, the danger that a free and fair election may not materialize in Sierra Leone this time around is a tragedy not only for the country but also for Britain that has invested so much in aid and support to the country in the past 11 years and it will be an uncomfortable development for Blair who ordered the original military intervention. So far, it seems that the APC government is on the track of holding an unprecedented transparent elections as consultative meetings and seminars have begun in earnest to forge understanding with key stakeholders such as the NEC, participating political parties, the Political Parties Registration Commission PPRC), the Sierra Leone Police etc to sensitize them on their roles and responsibilities in ensuring transparent elections. Essentially, it will be an underestimation to conclude that President Koroma is not at all serious about fighting corruption in the country. This can be viewed in the large number of the close allies of the government that have been prosecuted without any signs of favouritism. In the government's determination to fight corruption, one must take into account the ceremonious departure of Mrs AfsatuKabbah, who served as Minister of Energy and Power where she was accused of the dubious 'Income-Electrix' contract for the supply of electrical power generators before she was transferred to be Minister of Fisheries and Marine Resources where contracts awarded were not equally free from corrupt practices. The long list should also include the Commissioner of the National Revenue Authority (NRA) Alieu B. Sesay, the Maritime Administrator Philip Dukuly and the circumstances of cabinet reshuffles that sent Dr. Joseph Koroma from State House to China as ambassador as well as the dismissal of the Minister of Health and Sanitation, Dr Sheku Koroma. In the opinion of the hardworking Anti-Corruption Commission's (ACC) Commissioner Joseph Fitzgerald Kamara on the role of the ACC recently, he said the ACC is an established pillar of support to good governance, pursuing integrity in public life; confronting corruption through exposure system review, investigation and prosecution. He added that the new ACC Act 2008 now covers wide ranging issues including conflict of interest, unexplained and illegal acquisition of wealth, corruption in procurement, abuse of position and office to name a few."245,The Herald (Harare),12/30/11,Anti-Corruption Commission Rapped,,ZIMBABWE (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,3-Jan-12,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (70%)",189 words,CORRUPTION (92%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); CORPORATE COUNSEL (72%); EXECUTIVES (69%); SHAREHOLDERS (56%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE Anti-Corruption Commission was yesterday accused of abusing its office by arresting FCA Motors and Western Union franchise owner, Frederick Mtandah, who is facing over US$25 million fraud charges.

Mtandah, who is also a major shareholder of CAPS Holdings, is appearing before Harare magistrate Mr Kudakwashe Jarabini. To buttress its case, the State yesterday called the chief legal officer of the Anti-Corruption Commission Ms Monica Chizunza to furnish the court with the reasons why Mtandah should surrender his passport. In her evidence in chief, Ms Chizunza said the State erred in consenting to the temporary release of the passport, hence the need to rectify the issue. Ms Chizunza also argued that there were changed circumstances warranting the return of Mtandah's passport.

Rubavu district advertised five different types of tenders in tax and revenue collection. It included collection of taxes from Gisenyi town, Sebeya sand quarry, taxes from all sectors in the district, taxes from butcheries and all animal markets and taxes from motorists and cyclists. In July last year, there was a standoff between the district tender committee and the bidders who even petitioned the office of the Ombudsman, accusing the district top leadership of manipulating the tender procedures to award their cronies contracts. Now, barely three months after the tender was controversially awarded, reports say the District Advisory Council is cancelling the tenders, citing corruption and inflation of the standard tax tariff on the part of the contractors. Efforts to get a comment from Nelson Mbarushimana, the Executive Secretary of Rubavu, were futile as he didn't pick our several calls. But Mayor, Sheikh Hassan Bahame, confirmed the development, saying tax receipts that were being given to business people are not exactly what are presented to the district authorities. ""We have evidence that they charge high taxes which is against the stipulated charge. hence extorting residents,"" said Sheikh Bahame. ""Inflating taxes for unsuspecting citizens is theft which should not be tolerated, and as leaders, we must protect citizens."" However, Mustapha Majyambere, one of the contractors, told our reporter they had not received any official communication terminating their services. ""We are still working and the district has not written to us to stop us from working, and I can't make any more comments beyond this,"" said Majyambere. While Amin Francoise, who has the biggest contract to collect taxes in Gisenyi town declined to talk to the media when we called him. ""I don't discuss work related issues with the media on phone,"" said Amin before hanging up the phone. It emerged fingers are being pointed at some district leaders whom, it is alleged, are behind the extortion of the taxes since contracts were won by their relatives. ""We know some of the money stolen is deposited on an account belonging to the wife and brother of a top leader in the district,"" said a businessman who preferred not to be identified."248,The New Times (Kigali),1/7/12,Local Watchdog Challenges Judiciary Over Corruption,,RWANDA (94%),Newspaper,Edwin Musoni,ENGLISH,,,9-Jan-12,,562 words,CORRUPTION (92%); VERDICTS (90%); TRIAL & PROCEDURE (90%); BRIBERY (89%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (78%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (73%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (73%); TALKS & MEETINGS (69%); AGREEMENTS (64%); RANKINGS (61%) Rwanda; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Transparency Rwanda, has accused the judiciary of not eliminating legal procedures that may lead to corruption. Among those include sudden resumption of closed court cases. According to Chairperson of Transparency Rwanda, Marie Immacule Ingabire, her office has continuously complained about revisions of the court verdicts with an executory formula. An executory formula is an enforcement seal stamped on a court ruling that allows the implementation of the verdict. ""There are cases where a ruling is passed, the 30 days of appeal also expire but suddenly the defendant files an appeal under unclear circumstances. There is no way someone can convince us that there is no element of corruption in such arrangements,"" said Ingabire. She added that Transparency Rwanda has continuously raised the concerns with the Judiciary in vein. Reacting to the accusations, however, the spokesman of Courts, Charles Kaliwabo, refuted the claims, saying that lifting of executory formula seal cannot, in any way, encourage corruption. ""There are situations where a defendant fails to appeal within the required 30 days due to some valid reasons - maybe he or she was sick - in that case an executory formula seal is stamped on the court verdict and a court order is implemented. ""However, anytime the defendant shows up and proves beyond doubt that they were unable to appeal within the stipulated timeframe due to unavoidable reasons, the seal is lifted and the case is revised. This is the misunderstanding we have with Transparency Rwanda,"" said Kaliwabo. He added that the judiciary has held several meetings with Transparency over the same issue, but the parties have since failed to reach an agreement. ""We have requested Transperacy Rwanda to give us lists of the cases they claim were revised under unclear situations, but they have not given us that list,"" said Kaliwabo. Transparency Rwanda argues that, under no circumstances should a sealed case be resumed, and that the resumption of an already sealed case may be a result of a bribe. Meanwhile Rwanda Bribery Index 2011, released last month, indicates that the average size of bribes reduced from Rwf 27,000 in 2010 to Rwf 19,000 in 2011. Although the index does not capture high-profile corruption cases, it indicates that the most common form of corruption witnessed in Rwanda is bribery for purposes of securing a service. A statement from Transparency Rwanda published Thursday indicates reads in part: ""the likelihood of encountering bribe demand has reduced from 3.9 percent in 2010 to 1.19 percent in 2011. The institution with the highest likelihood of encountering a bribe demand situation is the police (5.83 percent) followed by mediators (4.62 percent) and the Civil Society (2.88 percent) takes the 3rd position, whereas it was ranked first in 2010."" It adds that in 2010 survey, the police was ranked 3rd. On a positive, however, the likelihood decreased from 6.1 percent in 2010 indicating an overall reduction in bribery demand cases. ""Village and Justice Institutions come right after the top three while health centres are still the best performers,"" reads the statement. The survey revealed 45 percent of those who engage in corruption do so to obtain services which they are entitled to and should get for free. This represents an increase from 30.7 percent in 2010, indicating an increasing burden on service seekers."249,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),1/10/12,"Don't Punish Corruption, Prevent It [opinion]",,ZAMBIA (93%),Newspaper,Murray Sanderson,ENGLISH,,,10-Jan-12,,863 words,CORRUPTION (89%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (89%); CIVIL SERVICES (78%); PREVENTION & WELLNESS (75%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (74%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (71%); PASSPORTS & VISAS (65%); LICENSES & PERMITS (65%) Zambia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"TODAY everyone is talking about punishing the massive corruption which took place under the MMD government. Fine, let's do that. Corruption does great harm to the country, and all honest Zambians want to see it punished. We all cheer when a big fish is caught and put behind bars. We want the Attorney General's Office strengthened and offenders prosecuted, and we want to bring back the law that treated as evidence of corruption the failure by government officials to account for unexplained wealth. But successful prosecution, when achieved, is less than half the battle. Prevention is far better than punishment. It is less exciting, but more effective, just as preventing disease is better than curing it. And with corruption, which is a social disease, prevention is also better than treatment. How can we prevent corruption? By removing, or greatly reducing the opportunities for it. It is, of course, not possible to remove ALL such opportunities. But there is great scope for removing, or at least reducing, most of them. I refer to the countless instances where civil servants in government offices, and in governmental institutions like NAPSA and the ZRA, are responsible for providing services to members of the general public. What kind of services? Almost anything you can think of: issuing national registration cards or passports, issuing any kind of license or permit, paying out any benefit to which a person is entitled, admitting students to institutions of learning, etc., etc. For there are countless requirements which ordinary people need to obtain from 'the powers that be' in order to make progress. The official approached for the document may not have the power to refuse to issue it, but he or she can usually find a way to delay issuing it, and delay can cause the applicant great inconvenience, as well as serious loss or expense. That gives the official concerned an opportunity to extract 'speed money'. If the official approached lacks the power to issue the document applied for, he can delay in recommending its issue to a senior who has the necessary authority. The point here is that civil servants at various levels can so manipulate a situation as to frustrate an applicant in order to extract money for performing an official duty in a timely manner. They may well not make any demand for payment. It is enough to delay and delay, until the applicant becomes so desperate that he or she resorts to offering payment for a service to which they are legally entitled. An alternative route for people who do not know how to apply, or who fear to get involved in corruption, is to pay a hefty sum to an 'agent' or a 'facilitator' to act on their behalf. The fact is that delays create desperation, which often leads to corruption. Indeed delays can virtually compel honest people to be corrupt in order to obtain a benefit to which they are legally entitled. So how can this kind of corruption be prevented? Many countries succeed in preventing it by getting public institutions to publish customer service charters or citizens' charters. Each charter commits the issuing institution to perform within a stipulated period each of the specific services which it offers. The charter is put on display at the institution's offices for members of the public to read. Then, if stated performance times are not met, applicants have the knowledge and the justification to appeal to senior staff. Charters of this kind are used in many countries. In Ghana every government institution has one, and they are very effective. There is even a ministry for government reform! In our own country the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) issued its Taxpayer Charter in February 2008. And in June that year the Ministry of Labour and the Immigration Department both published charters. Since then there has been talk of other ministries and government institutions issuing charters, but these have yet to be published. It is, of course, one thing to issue a charter, and another to make it effective. That is far more difficult. But it can be done, if there is determination, such as has been shown by the ZRA. The Authority invited the Zambia Institute for Public Policy Analysis (ZIPPA) to monitor the performance of the Taxpayer Charter, and to comment in the press on the ZRA's quarterly publication of results. Early last year the ZRA asked ZIPPA to carry out a detailed study of its Taxpayer Charter, and the Authority is now undertaking improvements recommended in the consultant's report. Apart from the three charters introduced in 2008, no other ministry or governmental institution has yet introduced a charter. But several are said to be planning to do so. Charter introduction is one good initiative started during the last government, although it was not persevered with. Let us hope that the Patriotic Front (PF) Government, with its strongly declared opposition to corruption, will recognise that customer service charters are powerful weapons in the war against corruption, and will embrace them with determination. It is good to look back and punish past corruption. But it is far more important to look ahead and do everything possible to prevent corruption in the future."250,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),1/18/12,Chief Mpezeni Blames Poverty On Corruption in MMD,,ZAMBIA (94%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,18-Jan-12,"LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (79%)",388 words,CORRUPTION (92%); POOR POPULATION (90%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (90%); POVERTY RATES (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (89%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (77%) Zambia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"PARAMOUNT Chief Mpezeni of the Ngoni people in Eastern Province has said the growing poverty levels in Zambia are as a resulted of gross corruption that took place during former president, Rupiah Banda's reign. Meanwhile, the traditional leader has rubbished accusations that the fight against corruption was targeted at people from certain tribes. Chief Mpezeni reiterated his calls that Mr Banda's immunity should be lifted to give him an opportunity to clear himself of corruption allegations. Speaking to the media after he paid a courtesy call on the President Michael Sata at State House in Lusaka yesterday, the traditional ruler said there was nothing special about Mr Banda and that he should be ready to face the courts just as some chiefs had been arraigned in courts. ""Se tamamfumu tuyenda ku court, lomba a Banda angalekelenji kuyenda ku court"" (We the chiefs have appeared in courts, what is so difficult about Mr Banda appearing in court?), he asked in his Ngoni language. He said the Patriotic Front (PF) Government had so far performed well since it assumed power and should be supported in all its causes. ""Boma iyi yatsopani chioneka kuti yugwira nchito. Vintu vambiri vinasokonezeka. (The new Government is performing well considering that so many things had gone wrong."" The paramount chief said it was important that the immunity be lifted because it was only the courts that could clear the allegations of corruption. Chief Mpezeni also said Zamtel did not belong to one individual but was for all the Zambians and that the sale should be reversed. He said it would be wrong to resist the people's popular demand for the Government to get back the 75 per cent shares in Zamtel. Chief Mpezeni said complaints that arrests and investigations were selective were incorrect because the police could only arrest people suspected to have stolen. The police would do so regardless of the people's status, political affiliation and tribe. He said people facing accusations should be bold enough and appear in the courts so that they could clear their names instead of resorting to counter accusations. The paramount chief said the investigations and arrests could not be targeted at people from the Eastern Province, citing former minister of Labour, Austin Liato who hails from Western Province and was already appearing in court."251,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),1/20/12,The Role of the Dpp - a Critical Anti-Corruption Assignment,,ZAMBIA (95%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,20-Jan-12,,1223 words,CORRUPTION (91%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); LAWYERS (89%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (77%); LITIGATION (77%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (76%); SUITS & CLAIMS (69%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (68%) Zambia; Corruption,"To prosecute or not to prosecute this is the daunting task which is bestowed on the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) whenever he is required to issue a consent. The DPP has to determine whether there is enough ground for any criminal agency to prosecute any case and advise accordingly. His advice will assist Government prevent wastage of time on non-issues and expedite the probe on clearly suspected cases. The fight against corruption in Zambia is an old one. It has been there before and has now been revamped with renewed vigour by the Patriotic Front (PF) Government. The approach is totally different and involves a new set of suspects. To start this crusade, a government has to be prepared to lose popularity especially among those that would be pursued by various investigative wings. This is normal and totally inevitable. However, Zambians should know that no criminal investigation goes to court without the consent of one key office-the DPP. Renowned lawyer in criminology and prosecution Mutembo Nchito is there to offer such vital guidance in this whole fight against corruption. He is now the DPP and all matters await his functionary duties. A man with an ease stature and a highly patriotic character to national issues, Mr Nchito bears the blessings of the head of State Michael Sata to get rid of all corruption and sort out all the past and present wrong doings in Zambia. This is indeed a great task. With a passion for his profession, Mr Nchito has spent more time in the courts of law in trying to pursue justice on behalf of the general public than just shifting in his posh office. He has all it takes for one to be called a comfortable person in society but he still feels the concerns of the majority Zambians on the high levels of corruption could be addressed using his skills as a lawyer. Previously Mr Nchito pursued corruption cases as a private lawyer hired by the then Task Force on Corruption, but this time he is a fully employed public servant occupying the DPP's office and determining which cases would be worthy pursuing. According to Mr Nchito, his appointment as DPP is purely owed to President Sata who identified his determination and prowess to rid Zambia of corruption. He is focused and will remain so as he executes his duties. Those with a criminal mind and have been thriving on corruption proceeds have all the reason to be scared with the appointment of Mr Nchito. Mr Nchito's role will include assisting the judiciary in determining where there is a case and where there is none at all. ""We will expect you to assist the Judiciary by preparing your cases; don't blame the Judiciary that they are acquitting people if you don't prepare your cases properly,"" President Sata said shortly after swearing-in Mr Nchito at State House. Mr Sata said third president of the Repulic of Zambia Levy Mwanawasa worked well and created the task force on corruption but his successor Rupiah Banda and his colleagues abandoned it. The Zambian laws should not segregate. Upon assuming his new role as DPP, Mr Nchito realises the need for all people to be equal before the law regardless of their status in society. According to Mr Nchito his appointment to the office of DPP is an opportunity to contribute to the rule of law. He believes that all Zambians must be accountable and held to the standard of the law. ""If we are all equal before the law, I believe that this country will develop. We can't have different laws for different people. We need one law for all of us,"" Mr Nchito said. He said he will sit down with his staff in the office (DPP) and look at the cases they are working on. ""I will ensure that I pick up from where my predecessor left. I am not going to try and do everything myself, I will sit down with my colleagues so that we can move the office forward together,"" he said. Mr Nchito said his office would not rush cases to court but ensure that good ground work is established before taking them to the courts of law. ""My team will take good cases before the courts of law. If some people are innocent, they are innocent. If they have an issue to answer, they have to be given a chance to be heard before the courts of law,"" Mr Nchito said. He said he would review all the high-profile cases, adding that all must be prepared to be answerable for previous conduct. Mr Nchito said when allegations were raised against someone, society must be patient enough to allow law enforcement agencies to investigate matters and bring them to finality. He promised to ensure that everyone was treated the same way and those that were accused were treated fairly. President Sata, who has publicly stated that he is allergic to corruption, said he wants to fight the vice to create new jobs and reduce high poverty levels at more than 65 per cent. Already Mr Nchito is showing his commitment to team work. The fight against corruption cannot be won by a single person. The appointment of Mr Nchito as DPP does not signify victory in corruption fight at all but just a start of the whole episode. He needs support and the other stakeholders equally need the support of his experience. So are other stakeholders aware of the task ahead and the need for team work? There are several cases before the DPP's office that really need to be addressed just like the ACC the DEC and the police are equally keeping a back-log of cases. The work load has to be offloaded fast to achieve the desired results. Corruption offences are being committed every day and hence the need for the fight to equally be doubled. Laxity in dealing with the scourge may result in a nullity of the entire efforts. According to Mr Sata, there is a lethal team put up to fight corruption at the moment. The combination of Mr Nchito, the solicitor General Musa Mwenye and the Attorney General Mumba Malila is just a complete armory required to defeat corruption in Zambia. The fight against corruption in Zambia could have been won by now had the spirit ignited by Dr Mwanawasa had been upheld by the successive leadership. The questions still lingering in most Zambians' minds is why the MMD under Mr Rupiah Banda as head of State abandoned the anti-corruption crusade which was driven by Dr Mwanawasa. Although an opportunity was lost, there is the renewed hope now that the Government has re-launched a much 'vicious' campaign to rid the nation of corruption. According to Mr Sata, there is need to: ""clean both visible and invisible cobwebs of corruption in Zambia."" The MMD did not only abolish the task force on corruption but removed the Abuse of Authority clause from the penal code. Some anti-corruption advocates had argued that the removal of the clause was a recipe for more corruption especially in the civil service where people were acquiring questionable assets not commensurate with their earnings. The PF is now contemplating reintroducing the abuse of office clause as one of the special, tools to fighting corruption. This intention has received overwhelming public support. Politicians, the church, the civil society and all others stakeholders should support calls for a revived corruption fight by the PF if equality before the law and the spirit of genuine hard work could be retained in Zambia. Corruption defeats the spirit of hard work as people tend to enjoy undue benefits and riches. With determination and zeal, this fight will be won."252,The New Times (Kigali),1/22/12,Local Leader Suspended Over Corruption,,RWANDA (79%),Newspaper,Dan Ngabonziza,ENGLISH,,,23-Jan-12,,229 words,CORRUPTION (93%); SCANDALS (78%); LAND USE PLANNING (70%) Rwanda; Corruption,"A local leader in Ngarama Sector, Gatsibo District, was relieved of his duties, after he was allegedly involved in a corruption scandal.

A big percentage of disputes registered in Gatsibo District are commonly land-related and authorities have been called on to step up measures against the vice. The district leadership vowed to facilitate residents from engaging in land disputes but instead adopt justice and peaceful mediation.

A total of 14 senior officials, including the former Republican president Mr Rupiah Banda and several former cabinet ministers, have been cited in the commission's report for various forms of suspected impropriety during MMD's reign. The commission, chaired by Mr Kingsley Chanda, former ZRA commissioner in charge of direct taxes, has recommended that ""appropriate action/investigations"" be instituted against the named officials. Among those named are former Finance and National Planning minister, Dr Situmbeko Musokotwane, former Works and Supply minister, Mike Mulongoti, former Transport and Communications minister, Prof Geoffrey Lungwangwa and former Local Government and Housing minister, Dr Eustarckio Kazonga. Two former ZRA commissioner generals, Mr Criticles Mwansa and Mr Wisdom Nhekairo have both been cited in the report. Mr Nhekairo is named in connection with the award of the controversial Bradwell contract, which was skewed in favour of the company engaged to operate ZRA border scanners, as well as justifying single-sourcing of the equipment on ""flimsy grounds"", and payments to Cargo Scan Limited with no regard to service delivery and contract terms. Mr Mwansa has similarly been cited for justifying direct bidding of Nuctech company and Cargo Scan Limited and justifying the procurement of four additional scanners and reduction of the floatation period. The report paints a picture of unprecedented levels of impunity in the manner in which key Government functionaries circumvented laid down procedures aimed at ensuring transparency and accountability in the procurement process. Failure to adhere to prescribed procedures will impact adversely on the Zambian tax payers who will foot the bill from the US$125 million loan contracted from the Chinese Government. The genesis of the deal dates back to 2007 when the then president Levy Mwanawasa visited China and negotiated for a credit line of US$100 million for storage sheds for Food Reserve Agency ($11million), Government complex ($25 million), earth moving equipment $39 (million), irrigation ($12.5 million), and water and sanitation ($12.5 million). The coordination of the use of the loan, including the purchase of four scanners, was delegated to then vice-president Banda. When Mr Banda ascended to the presidency in 2008, part of the loan ($50 million) which was reserved for irrigation, water and sanitation was diverted, on the advice of Chinese officials, to the procurement of four additional scanners, bringing the total to eight. The total loan contracted was also increased from $100 million to $125 million to cover the cost of four scanners. Then Finance minister Ng'andu Magande opposed the variation of funds to favour procurement of scanners, while then secretary to the treasury Evans Chibiliti cautioned Government to take into account the views of the technocrats who had advised against procurement of more scanners. Dr Musokotwane also excpressed misgivings about the additional equipment, but the advice was ignored as Government proceeded to buy the eight scanners from Nuctech, and all of them were single sourced, a decision which the commission has criticised. Although the speedy procurement was purported to be based on urgent need to enhance revenue collection at the borders, the equipment has been lying idle since its importation, save for one installed at Chirundu. The commission is appalled, and understandably so, at the callousness and impunity of the individuals involved. The decision to circumvent the open tender process is indefensible and single-sourcing has cast serious doubts on the whole procurement process, and the motives by the key figures who sanctioned the illegal purchase. We hope the investigations will leave no stone unturned in order to ensure that all those linked to the scanners purchase, the Bradwell contract and related matters are brought to book."254,Addis Fortune,2/1/12,Corruption Could Undermine Nation's Develoment Goals - Sebhat Nega,,"ETHIOPIA (94%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (79%)",Newspaper,Abdi Tsegaye,ENGLISH,,,28-Feb-12,,800 words,CORRUPTION (93%); PUBLIC FINANCE (89%); POLLS & SURVEYS (88%); EXCISE & CUSTOMS (88%); ETHICS (77%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (77%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (77%); INFLATION (75%); ECONOMIC NEWS (75%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (74%); TAX AUTHORITIES (73%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (72%); PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION (69%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (69%); COST OF LIVING (67%); FOOD SECURITY (67%); WATER CRISES & SHORTAGES (62%); HOTELS & MOTELS (55%); FOOD CRISES & SHORTAGES (50%) Ethiopia; Corruption,"Sebhat Nega, one of the founders of the TPLF and a veteran fighter during the armed struggle, made a statement last week that raised eyebrows around town. If left unchecked, corruption could undermine the nation's development efforts, although it might not have reached that capability yet, Sebhat warned, serving as a director general for the Ethiopian International Institute for Peace & Development (EIIPD). Speaking to the media at a conference that his Institute, a federal think-tank on foreign policy issues, organised at the Ghion Hotel, on Wednesday, February 22, 2012, Sebhat also criticised the government for doing little in practical terms to fight corruption, while there are widespread rumours among members of the public about government officials and federal agencies suspected of being corrupt. Federal agencies, such as the Ethiopian Revenues & Customs Authority (ERCA) are rife with what the public perception that Sebhat alluded to accuses them of, a new study has confirmed. Conducted for the second time in a decade, after securing a close to eight million Birr, fund from the World Bank, the corruption perception survey was released a day before Sebhat's statement at the Ghion. Close to 17pc of business enterprises that responded to questionnaires had been asked to pay gratification in return for services at public institutions over the past 12 months, they said, according to the second nationwide corruption survey, which was commissioned by the Federal Ethics & Anticorruption Commission (FEAC) and conducted by a Tanzanian-based US company, Kilimanjaro International Corporation (KIC), after beating 19 bidders. The survey measures views, perceptions, and experience of respondents from the pubic on corruption and its perception. Nonetheless, corruption is rated as the seventh-most serious socioeconomic problem experienced by citizens in the country, preceded by a lack of access to safe drinking water, food shortages, lack of quality roads and networks, poor public transportation, unemployment, and high cost of living and inflation, in that order. A considerable amount of the public has to ""catalyse"" the efficiency of the services they seek from public institutions through extra payments, in the forms of gratification, the survey finds. The survey identified the judiciary, law enforcement community, municipalities, and the ERCA as places that most people perceived as being prone to corruption and inefficient public service delivery. The ERCA was singled out 10 years ago during the first survey, although it was then divided into three federal agencies: the Ministry of Revenues, the Ethiopian Customs Authority (ECA), and the Federal Inland Revenues Authority (FIRA). It was believed that forming a single large and powerful federal Agency could provide a base for a modern and equitable tax and customs administration regime, effective resource utilisation and fast service delivery. However, despite the relentless efforts made so far towards combating corruption and providing effective public service, specially, in the areas of custom clearance, as well as tax and revenue collection, it has remained a challenge both to the service provider and the service seeker, according to the new survey. A study by the World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) also corroborate the findings in this survey. ""A standard export shipment of goods from Ethiopia requires seven documents and takes an average of 42 days at a cost of 1,760 dollars per container whereas a standard import shipment of goods requires nine documents and takes an average of 44 days at a cost of 2,660 dollars per container,"" according to the World Bank. The same message was also echoed by the business community, during the second Public Private Consultative Forum (PPCF) held at Sheraton Addis, two weeks ago. The ERCA suffers from about eight shortcomings, including a lack of clarity on procedures as well as an absence of coordination among federal agencies that make decisions at various stages of importing. Though corruption remains a problem in the country, as strongly emphasised by Sebhat, the two topmost problems faced by citizens - inflation and unemployment - have perceivably created a conducive environment and breeding ground for corruption. The complexity of the government procurement procedures and the requirement to pay gratification to public officials were among the major obstacles that the business community faces in doing business with the government, the survey also revealed. ""Managing inflation should constitute an important element in the fight against corruption,"" the report recommends. However, rumours of corruption by agencies and senior government officials should be urgently investigated to determine whether they have any merit, Sebhat suggested."256,The Namibian (Windhoek),2/7/12,Aupindi Denies Swimming Pool Corruption Charges,,NAMIBIA (90%),Newspaper,Denver Kisting,ENGLISH,,,7-Feb-12,,569 words,CORRUPTION (91%); WITNESSES (90%); TESTIMONY (90%); MAGISTRATES (78%); EVIDENCE (78%); CROSS EXAMINATIONS (78%); BUILDING RENOVATION (69%) Namibia; Corruption,"STATE witnesses battled to keep their heads above water yesterday on the first day of the corruption trial of former Namibia Wildlife Resorts (NWR) MD Tobie Aupindi. Aupindi and Antonio di Savino, his co-accused, pleaded not guilty to a charge of corruption and an alternative charge of attempting to defeat or obstruct the course of justice. The State alleges that Di Savino paid for a swimming pool for Aupindi in 2006. Di Savino allegedly forked out N$50 000 for the pool at Aupindi's Hochland Park residence, Herman Kuhn testified yesterday. Kuhn works for LIC Pool Centre. He claimed that Di Savino approached him to buy a pool in December 2006. Although he initially told Di Savino that he would not be able to install the swimming pool because of a tight December schedule, he later agreed to do so. This was allegedly done at an additional cost of N$12 000. During cross-examination by Aupindi's lawyer Richard Metcalfe, Kuhn was less sure of his version. He agreed that documentation on which he based his side of the story was prepared by someone else at LIC Pool Centre. Moreover, he could not explain two payments of N$25 000 to their business. This, Metcalfe argued, was money that Aupindi paid himself and that Di Savino in fact did not pay for Aupindi's swimming pool. Kuhn went as far as admitting that he manipulated and changed documents but ""only when asked"". Guiseppe Ditrapani, who was allegedly first approached by Di Savino to install a pool at Aupindi's house, battled to remember the dates on which what happened. What was not disputed was that he received N$38 000 from Di Savino but was later told to vacate Aupindi's premises - seemingly after he took too long to install the pool. Of the N$38 000, Ditrapani later returned N$33 000 to Di Savino. The trial before Magistrate Helvi Shilemba is scheduled to continue today. Aupindi appeared confident throughout yesterday's proceedings. Before the start of the trial, he told The Namibian that he was ""excited and fired-up inside. It's good that there is a legislative framework to fight corruption. But it's up to them to prove their case."" In May last year, an anti-graft website Corruption Watch Namibia reported that documents in its possession show that Di Savino had forked out N$50 000 for the state-of-the-art pool installed at Aupindi's house. Di Savino allegedly paid for the pool with a cheque on December 12 2006. It is alleged that this 'gift' came at a price - tenders to refurbish the beleaguered parastatal's run-down resorts. The NWR, during Aupindi's tenure, came under fire for not employing professional engineers to manage the multimillion-dollar renovation projects. One such company which NWR also appointed was Tane Mahuta - a company which evaded tax. In April 2010, The Namibian reported that Tane Mahuta failed to pay a single cent in income tax despite cashing in at least N$40 million from NWR. This was for work done at Ai-Ais - approximately N$37 million, and at the Sesriem Campsite - around N$5 million. It was reported that Aupindi instructed an employee to pay the amounts to Tane Mahuta while a substantial part of the upgrading work had not yet been done. Furthermore, the budget for Ai-Ais alone had been overspent by at least N$10 million. In February 2010, it was reported that Aupindi had been pocketing hefty sums in board fees. The Namibian then reported that he had raked in close to N$80 000 between 2007 and 2008."257,The Namibian (Windhoek),2/10/12,ACC Rejects Mariental Corruption Claims,,NAMIBIA (79%),Newspaper,Luqman Cloete,ENGLISH,,,10-Feb-12,,184 words,INVESTIGATIONS (92%); CORRUPTION (92%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%); CITY GOVERNMENT (90%); CITIES (88%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (87%); MISAPPROPRIATION (72%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (70%); EXECUTIVES (53%) Namibia; Corruption,"THE Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) will not investigate allegations of corruption made by residents against the Mariental municipality.

The move to clear corruption cases was part of the Supreme Courts campaign against corruption, which started Monday this week and ended yesterday. Kaliwabo revealed this while speaking to journalists, shortly before a procession of all employees in the justice sector, which marked the end of this year's Supreme Court campaign against the vice. ""We had planned to clear all the cases by the end of this week, but today's report is yet to be released,"" he said. ""The campaign has yielded positive results since it started, but there is need for more efforts to effectively fight this vice,"" he said. Last year's campaign saw eight judicial employees - including six judges - suspended on corruption-related cases. Between 2009 and 2011, 14 people were also arrested for attempting to bribe judges. This year's campaign was taken to villages, the lowest governance level, where the public were sensitised how to partner with the judiciary in the fight against the vice. ""We want the public to know that we are ready to work with them to end corruption. Those who say that the justice sector is built on corruption are just tarnishing our image,"" he observed.

Among other things, participants urged partner states to provide more funding towards anti-graft programmes and mechanisms, and to do more to protect whistle blowers. While it was noted that partner states had taken positive steps to address corruption, various weaknesses were identified including the fact that, in some countries, anti-corruption watchdogs were themselves corrupt. The meeting came at a time when some EAC states ranked so poorly on the Transparency International's global corruption index, with only Rwanda belonging to what is known as 'Africa's clean states'. However, with concerted efforts, experience sharing and close follow-up on the agreed measures, the EAC can go a long way in addressing one of the main threats to business and service delivery in the region. East Africans, particularly traders, have repeatedly cited corruption among the main Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs), which increase the cost of doing business with the final consumer bearing the ultimate burden. It is important that EAC member states learn from each other's experiences so that successful measures in one country are replicated in the others to ensure better results."260,The Namibian (Windhoek),2/16/12,Khorixas Residents to March Against Corruption,,NAMIBIA (79%),Newspaper,Staff Reporter,ENGLISH,,,16-Feb-12,,180 words,CORRUPTION (92%); CITY GOVERNMENT (91%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); CITIES (90%); PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (90%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); CONSTRUCTION (88%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (87%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (86%); HOUSING AUTHORITIES (73%); EXECUTIVES (72%); CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTING (71%); ARRESTS (70%) Namibia; Corruption; Governance; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Khorixas residents will take to the streets today to demand the axing of town council employees implicated in the disappearance of about N$400 000 at the council.

The demonstrators in no uncertain terms called for the current CEO Nicodemus Gaeseb to be replaced with a new chief executive. The unhappy residents met at Eddie Bowe soccer field early in the morning before marching through the informal settlement of Donkerhoek to the Khorixas Town Council under the leadership of community activist Romeo Nauseb. ""Money given by the central government is sent back to Windhoek, while no development takes place at Khorixas,"" Nauseb told The Namibian. \Nauseb also alleged that ""most of the tenders given through the Khorixas Town Council mainly benefit family members and friends of those on the council"". He further said although millions of dollars had been budgeted for a prepaid water system in 2008, nothing has been done. The demonstrators also questioned the suspension three weeks ago of the head of finance, Gerhard Amingo /Honneb, and the resignation of Pasquela Ouses, a revenue collection clerk. /Honneb's suspension comes amidst calls for the axing of three officials of the council who have been charged by the Anti-Corruption Commission with the disappearance of about N$400 000 at the council. The three officials allegedly have become untouchables at the council, with the town councillors allegedly refusing to take action against them. ""Those who talk the truth like /Honneb are suspended,"" one of the demonstrators shouted. When the demonstrators arrived at the Khorixas Town Council building, the situation was tense, as they refused to hand over their petition to CEO Gaeseb. ""We want the mayor, Andries !Aebeb, or the deputy mayor, Moloto, to take the petition,"" they chanted, closely monitored by armed Police. Some protesters threw stones at the council offices before the Police intervened. After much argument between the CEO and the demonstrators and with the intervention of the Police the petition was later handed to the CEO, who promised to forward it to the Minister of Regional, Local Government and Housing, Jerry Ekandjo, to whom it is addressed. At one stage Gaeseb requested the Police to remove the demonstrators, since they had not notified the council of their demonstration and the handing over of a petition. Accepting the petition, Gaeseb said: ""Thank you Khorixas residents who are concerned about the town. Your problems are our problems. I will take it up to the highest office; give us time to go through it."" Asked about the allegations in the petition, Gaeseb said: ""I cannot talk about them now, but someone else will investigate me and reveal them.""

The deal with Anglo-Irish company Tullow Oil lacks transparency, contend critics who do not want to see Uganda go the way of other African countries like Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea and Angola, where a small elite became fabulously wealthy off petroleum while most citizens remained deeply impoverished Dickens Kamugisha, CEO of the Uganda-based Africa Institute for Energy Governance, complained that the agreements between the government and the oil companies are secret, and so are environmental and feasibility studies. Uganda's High Court is to hear a petition March 5, filed by Kampala lawyer Hamada Mulumba as a concerned citizen in December, asking the court to temporarily halt the government from signing any oil deals. But earlier this month, after more than a year of acrimonious negotiations, the government signed two licenses with London-based Tullow Oil. The agreements, worth US$2,9 billion, allow Tullow to sell two-thirds of its Uganda interests to China's CNOOC Ltd and France's Total. Tullow agreed the oil would be refined in Uganda and not exported as crude. Ugandan legislators resolved three months ago that all oil contracts should be suspended until Parliament puts in place laws and institutions to ensure transparency in the industry. Still, the deal with Tullow Oil was inked. Government spokesman Fred Opolot said the government ""is not bound by parliamentary resolutions, which are advisory"". A spokeswoman for Tullow Oil, Kate Lehane, said the government of Uganda decided the timing of the deal. ""Tullow is dealing with the government of Uganda and the executive,"" she said. ""Tullow remain very keen to talk to Parliament."" Kamugisha said civil society organizations are threatening to work with international partners to blacklist Tullow as they threaten to challenge the legality of the agreements at the Constitutional Court. Oil Network Uganda, an activist civil group, is mobilising communities to oppose the construction of any refinery or pipelines until a new law is enacted to provide proper compensation, resettlement and conflict resolution to those affected or displaced by the project, said Henry Mugisha, chairman of the group. Eleven residents who say they have lost grazing grounds and harvests during drilling for oil exploration are threatening to sue Tullow. The company says it has paid about 38 000 claims for structures and crops damaged during its exploration for oil but farmers complain it took months to get paid and that the rates were too low at just over US$1 for each square meter of a cassava plantation. Orchards of mangoes and oranges also have been lost. Tullow declined to say how much it had paid in total compensation. Community activist Isaac Nkuba of the Buliisa NGO forum said the damage occurred in January 2011 and people were only paid last November and December. Francis Beeta, a farmer who was paid nearly US$340 for his destroyed cassava plantation said: ""We are angry because we feel like we have been cheated."" Uganda issued its first oil exploration license in 1902 when it was a British colony, according to Fred Guweddeko, a Makerere University research fellow. The poor quality of the waxy and sulfur-laden oil kept companies from pumping it out until new technology and high oil prices made it viable. Now drilling rigs for test holes have been sprouting on Uganda's landscape. Conservative estimates suggest Uganda could earn around US$2 billion a year for the next 30 to 35 years from the deposits, which lie below forests and lakes along a border with conflict-torn eastern Congo. Despite the efforts at gaining transparency, skepticism is running high that the Uganda's oil will better the lives of its regular citizens. Uganda's government has made huge stride fighting poverty, with about 25 per cent of the population living below the poverty line in 2010, according to the World Bank, but the country is struggling with a growing gap between rich and poor. ""All signs are that Uganda will be the latest nation to fall victim to the 'oil curse' - cheated of its financial benefits by a corrupt government and left with extensive environmental damage,"" said Uganda's Association of Professional Environmentalists. Critics are already complaining that more than US$300 000 paid in signature bonuses on oil contracts already have gone missing. Legislators have accused the prime minister and two Cabinet ministers of taking millions of dollars in bribes from Tullow - charges Tullow denies. Two long-serving Cabinet ministers and stalwarts of President Yoweri Museveni resigned this week over graft allegations unrelated to oil. Three other ministers were forced to resign last year because of corruption allegations. Museveni has been in power since 1986. The Constitutional Court has barred legislators from investigating their charges while it rules on a motion that the parliamentarians' investigation is improper and out of order. Tullow spokesman George Casanove said documents presented to Parliament are ""forgeries, unquestionably and irrefutably"". He said the company is looking forward to demonstrating that publicly when it is summoned to appear before the parliamentary committee. He said the company does not know who made the forgeries, or what the motivation was. Still, legislators and activists also are angry with Tullow, and the issue has divided legislators from the president's party. Ugandan newspapers report that some have had a change of heart though because of a new US$40 000 allowance to buy cars. ""The culpability of government is obvious but so is the role of Tullow,"" said Ssekikubo, a legislator from Museveni's party. ""If you promote the breakdown of the rule and law in the country of your interest, how will you ensure that your interests are covered?"""263,The Namibian (Windhoek),2/21/12,Ruling Delivers Blow to Corruption Act,,NAMIBIA (94%),Newspaper,Werner Menges,ENGLISH,,,21-Feb-12,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (90%)",1013 words,CORRUPTION (95%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (90%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (90%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (90%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (89%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (89%); CONSTITUTIONAL LAW (78%); LITIGATION (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); MONEY LAUNDERING (73%); CRIME PREVENTION (71%) Namibia; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Corruption,"A KEY part of Namibia's Anti-Corruption Act is unconstitutional, it was ruled in the High Court in Windhoek yesterday. The definition of ""corruptly"" in the Anti-Corruption Act is unconstitutional because it is ""unduly vague"", Judges Dave Smuts and Elton Hoff and Acting Judge Kobus Miller ruled in a case in which the constitutionality of sections of the Anti-Corruption Act and the Prevention of Organised Crime Act (POCA) was under attack. At the same time, the constitutionality of the dual appointment of Cabinet member Pendukeni Iivula-Ithana as Justice Minister and Attorney General in 2005 was also being questioned. While the three judges struck down the definition of ""corruptly"" as unconstitutional, they dismissed the attacks on the constitutionality of other sections of the Anti-Corruption Act and POCA, and ruled that the appointment of Iivula-Ithana as both Attorney General and Minister of Justice was not unconstitutional. Although the court's ruling is a blow to the Anti-Corruption Act, it is not a fatal one. The remainder of the Anti-Corruption Act remains intact, and it would be up to courts to interpret what is meant by the word ""corruptly"" where it is used in other parts of that law, it is indicated in the court's judgement, which was written by Judge Smuts. ""In doing so, the courts would have regard as to how the term is understood including its dictionary definition, its definitions in international instruments and how it has been interpreted by this or other courts in giving content to that concept,"" the judge said. The judgement was delivered in an application which fraud and money laundering suspects Teckla Lameck and Kongo Mokaxwa filed with the High Court in March last year. Lameck and Mokaxwa attacked the Anti-Corruption Act's definition of the term ""corruptly"" as being unreasonable, vague and too wide. The Act defines ""corruptly"" as meaning ""in contravention of or against the spirit of any law, provision, rule, procedure, process, system, policy, practice, directive, order or any other term or condition pertaining to any employment relationship; any agreement; or the performance of any function in whatever capacity"". Senior counsel Jeremy Gauntlett, representing Lameck and Mokaxwa, argued during the hearing of the application at the end of November last year that policies are not binding legal instruments, that it is difficult to establish what practices are, and that the vagueness of the definition was compounded by the use of the term ""against the spirit of"", Judge Smuts recounted in the judgement. Gauntlett further argued that the Anti-Corruption Act's definition of ""gratification"", which was also attacked, was limitless and was unreasonably and impermissibly wide, the judge also recounted. He remarked that he agreed with senior counsel Wim Trengove, representing the President, the Minister of Justice, the Attorney-General, the Prosecutor General and the Director of the Anti-Corruption Commission, that the concept of corruption is something which does not lend itself to neat and precise formulation and delineation. However, the definition of ""corruptly"", Judge Smuts said, ""would seem to me to be unduly vague and (does) not meet the test of indicating with reasonable certainty what is hit by it to those who are bound by it"". ""The same cannot be said for the definition of gratification,"" he further stated. ""Although wide, it is not in my view unduly vague."" The Act's definition of ""gratification"" is a lengthy one, and includes ""money or any gift, loan, fee, reward, commission, valuable security or property or interest in property of any description, whether movable or immovable"", ""any office, dignity, employment, contract of employment or services and any agreement to give employment or render services in any capacity"", ""any valuable consideration or benefit of any kind, any discount, commission, rebate, bonus, deduction or percentage"", ""any right or privilege"", and so forth. The attack on Iivula-Ithana's appointment as both Attorney General and Minister of Justice was aimed at the Justice Minister's fixing of May 5 2009 as the date when POCA came into operation. Gauntlett's argument was that because she could not hold both those posts at the same time, she could not validly put the law into operation, and thus it is not legally in force yet. His argument was rejected. The Attorney General is - like any member of the Cabinet - a political appointee who holds office at the President's pleasure, Judge Smuts found. The Attorney General's powers and functions would not be incompatible with membership of the Cabinet, and given the wide powers of appointment vested in the President it would not be in conflict with the Constitution for the President to appoint a minister as Attorney General or appoint the Attorney General as a member of the Cabinet, if he or she is a member of the National Assembly as required, the judge said. The constitutional challenge to POCA was based mainly on an argument that the law was retrospectively criminalising and imposing penalties for conduct which had been lawful when it was committed. What POCA actually does, Judge Smuts found, is to criminalise the current possession, use or acquisition of the proceeds of unlawful activities, and not the original conduct which rendered those proceeds as unlawful. In the context of the whole application Lameck and Mokaxwa did not achieve substantial success, Judge Smuts commented. As a result, he ordered that they should bear 80 per cent of their opponents' legal costs in the matter, while the respondents should pay 20 per cent of Lameck and Mokaxwa's legal costs. Lameck, Mokaxwa and Chinese national Yang Fan are facing charges over an alleged corrupt deal in which Chinese-made security scanning equipment was bought by the Ministry of Finance in 2008. It is alleged that the price of the equipment was inflated to enable the manufacturer of the equipment, Nuctech, which was being represented by Yang, to pay a ""commission"" of at least US$12,828 million to Teko Trading, a close corporation of Lameck and Mokaxwa."264,The New Times (Kigali),2/22/12,African Countries Urged to Emulate Country's Anti-Corruption Drive,,"AFRICA (99%); RWANDA (94%); MAURITIUS (79%); CAPE VERDE (79%); BOTSWANA (79%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (79%)",Newspaper,Frank Kanyesigye,ENGLISH,,,22-Feb-12,"KIGALI, RWANDA (78%)",416 words,CORRUPTION (93%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (90%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (78%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%); GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (77%); ECONOMIC NEWS (77%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (77%); SCANDALS (73%); DEVELOPMENT BANKS (73%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (72%); TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (70%) Rwanda; Corruption,"A regional meeting bringing together experts to explore the best possible ways to combat corruption on the African continent, have hailed Rwanda's policies against graft.

""Africa loses more than US$148 billion annually, or 25 percent of its GDP, as a result of corruption. The unrelenting spread of corruption has not helped our continent's image and growth perspectives,"" he asserted. Hoseah stated that strong partnership is highly needed between the African Union (AU) and the continent's anti-graft institutions to reduce or eradicate loopholes of corruption in Africa. He pointed out that 31 out of 54 countries in Africa have ratified the AU convention to combat corruption in Africa. ""We call upon those nations who have not ratified the convention to do it urgently. If we rally behind the principle and strengthen our cooperation, we can eliminate the vice,"" he noted. The meeting was organised by UNECA, through the Governance and Public Administration Division (GPAD), in collaboration with the Africa Union Advisory Board on Corruption (AUABC). The forum will be followed by an expert meeting on illicit financial outflows for Africa from 23 to 24 February. Rwanda's Augustine Nzindukiyimana, the acting Ombudsman, observed that it was high time African governments found a lasting solution to corruption which has crippled development in the continent. ""Rwanda is committed to eradicating corruption. We have consistently dealt with graft cases,"" he noted. Rwanda was ranked fourth least corrupt African country by the World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) project according to the report released late last year. The country scored 70.8 percent, the fourth highest score, behind Mauritius with 73.2 percent, Cape Verde with 74.6 percent and Botswana which is the least corrupt African country with a score of 79.9percent."265,Concord Times (Freetown),2/24/12,Anti-Corruption Commission to Release VP Sumana/Aljazeera Findings,,SIERRA LEONE (92%),Newspaper,Mohamed Massaquoi,ENGLISH,,,24-Feb-12,,253 words,INVESTIGATIONS (93%); CORRUPTION (90%); JOURNALISM (90%); NEWS REPORTING (87%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); WRITERS (72%); DOCUMENTARY FILMS (68%); FORESTRY & LOGGING TRADE (67%); EXPORT TRADE (50%) Sierra Leone; Governance; Press and Media; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Labour,"Commissioner of the Anti-Corruption Commission, ACC has disclosed that after a rigorous investigation process, the commission has collected enough evidence on the Aljazeera TV allegations on some senior government officials in the country for presentation to the public soon.

""Some time ago, the government asked the ACC and the Sierra Leone police to investigate the Aljazeera saga,"" the ACC boss briefed newsmen, stressing that his commission will ensure appropriate actions are instituted against those found wanting. ""This is a matter we have been working on over the past months and the commission has travelled even out of the country to investigate and very soon our investigation will be made public."" It would be recalled that late last year, Aljazeera news network screened a documentary revealing a timber deal that allegedly transpired between undercover journalists and two men, Alex Mansaray and Momoh Konte, who were linked to the VP's office. The journalists visited Vice President Sam-Sumana's office posing as businessmen; they met with the VP and the two men who claimed to be official advisors to the vice president. Later the two men sought and accepted cash payments from the 'businessmen', which they claimed would help secure the VP's support for a timber export business that the undercover reporters wished to establish."266,The Herald (Harare),2/25/12,ZRP Stresses Zero-Tolerance to Corruption,,ZIMBABWE (94%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,25-Feb-12,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (73%)",222 words,CORRUPTION (91%); ETHICS (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (73%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (68%); ELECTIONS (67%); REFERENDUMS (67%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE Zimbabwe Republic Police will not hesitate to crack the whip on its members found engaging in corrupt activities.

""I would like to urge you to take a leading role in the fight against corruption, hence collective effort is required to rid the police of all members who engage in corrupt activities,"" Deputy Comm-Gen Sibanda said. He said officers should always remember that discipline and moral uprightness were pivotal to all their policing endeavours.

The agreement is to establish a broader framework and principles of close collaboration on issues of mutual interest between the two leading organizations. HFAC executive director, Charles Mambu, said his organization had earlier requested ACC officials to conduct a system review of his institution so as to guide its projects implementation processes, noting that the partnership would ensure that the free health care plan becomes more effective and in the interest of Sierra Leoneans. ""Health For All and the ACC are two separate institutions with programme objectives rooted in support for accountability, transparency and empowerment to enhance service delivery,"" Mambu said, citing that his institution has received enormous support from UNFPA, DfID and the government of Sierra Leone through the ministry of health and sanitation for the past years. ""The two institutions will therefore make critical impact by cooperating in all areas of joint focus interest. It is against this backdrop that we have freely entered into this agreement,"" he said. While signing the agreement, ACC Commissioner, Joseph F.

Magistrate Helvi Shilemba dismissed the men's application for a discharge ""and the accused are placed on their defence to explain"". At the close of the State's case, Richard Metcalfe for Aupindi and Louis du Pisani for Di Savino asked for the discharge of their clients. In terms of the Criminal Procedure Act, an accused should be discharged at the end of the State's case if there is no evidence before the court that the accused committed the offences they are charged with. The application came after Metcalfe earlier argued that Aupindi's prosecution stems from a personal vendetta by freelance journalist John Grobler. Metcalfe told the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) investigating officer, William Lloyd, that it appears as if a website article written by Grobler was based on Lloyd's docket. ""It seems as if this man [Grobler] has intimate knowledge of the ACC and it looks like he had a copy of the docket."" This article appeared before the Prosecutor General had decided to charge Aupindi and co-accused Antonio di Savino, Metcalfe charged. Lloyd maintained that he ""never made contact with this guy [Grobler] in my life"". He conceded that, based on articles that Metcalfe read out in court, it appears that Grobler ""is angry with Mr Aupindi"". Metcalfe told the investigating officer that Grobler ""seems to have gone on a mission to crucify Aupindi"". Metcalfe further grilled Lloyd for never taking a statement from Michael Kuhn, owner of LIC Pool Centre CC. Lloyd only took a statement from Herman Kuhn, Michael's brother, in which it was alleged that Di Savino had paid N$50 000 for installing the pool at Aupindi's Hochland Park house. Michael Kuhn, on the other hand, said Aupindi had paid cash for the pool. Aupindi and Di Savino went on trial for allegedly lying to Lloyd about who footed the pool bill. Lloyd claims that information given to the ACC suggested that Di Savino bought Aupindi the swimming pool as a gift in exchange for NWR tenders. As part of the investigation, Lloyd also had to follow up information from a media source provided to the ACC Director, Paulus Noa, the investigation officer said. Because he did not deal with this source directly, he could not say whether it was Grobler. Lloyd, during his testimony, also claimed that Aupindi and Di Savino had made ""confusing statements"" to him. In the end, it was decided not to pursue the claims of kickbacks as the ACC could not obtain sufficient documentation to corroborate the allegations, Lloyd said. Both Aupindi and Di Savino pleaded not guilty to a charge of corruption as well as an alternative charge of attempting to defeat or obstruct the course of justice at the start of the trial. Public Prosecutor Arrie Husselmann acts on behalf of the State. On Friday, Shilemba postponed the case until March 19 for the continuation of the trial."269,Addis Fortune,3/1/12,Former Regional President to See Regular Trial Over Alleged Corruption,,ETHIOPIA (79%),Newspaper,Mahlet Mesfin,ENGLISH,,,21-Mar-12,,419 words,MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (90%); EVIDENCE (90%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (90%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); LITIGATION (90%); APPEALS (90%); BRIBERY (89%); TRIAL & PROCEDURE (79%); JUDGES (79%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (78%); CRIMINAL DEFENSES (77%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (76%); LAWYERS (75%); BOARDING SCHOOLS (75%); PRIVATE SCHOOLS (74%); CONSULTING SERVICES (73%); VOCATIONAL & TECHNICAL TRAINING (69%); CONSTRUCTION DELAYS & STOPPAGES (69%); TEACHER EDUCATION (69%) Ethiopia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Judges at the Federal High Court ruled last week in the case of Yaregal Aysehshume, former president of Benishangul Gumuz Regional State, who was also an MP and director general of the Federal Cooperative Agency, and six other defendants charged for alleged corruption, for them to go through normal trial procedures. The case has been under summery charge ever since law enforcement agencies arrested Yaregal and his co-defendants in October 2010, accused of abuse of office, concealment of unearned assets, and corruption. The Court has been conducting the case in a preliminary inquiry since then, in which public prosecutors presented 27 pages of charges, with material and testimonial evidence. The defendants, including Habtamu Hika, former chief of the Region's Education Bureau; Gezahegn Adegeh, general manager of Gad Construction; Gedion Demeke, general manager of Gedion Demeke Consultancy; Mekbib Moges, general manager of Colon Construction; Assefa Gebeyehu; and Hailegebriel Hika, a younger brother of Habtamu, also presented their statement of defence. Requesting that both parties present their evidence, Presiding Judge Abohoy Guade, adjourned the case to June 12, 2012, despite appeals from the defence lawyers for the time to be shorter. Family members of the defendants who crowded almost half of the spacious Federal High Court 15th Criminal Bench hall, on Chad Street, were not pleased. Yaregal's wife, Tigist Bekele, was among the family members seen crying in the courtroom. Defendants were charged for allegedly tampering with the bid process for the construction of three educational institutions, whose costs were funded from the federal subsidiary budget given to the Regional State in 2006. This resulted in the delay of construction, which was supposed to be completed within a year. Tana Beles, a boarding school for women, Gilgel Beles Teachers Training College; and Assosa Technical & Vocational Education & Training (TVET) Centre were the institutions planned to be constructed in the five zones of the Regional State during the presidency of Yaregal. Yaregal and Habtamu had allegedly handed over the design and supervision work of the three projects to Gedion Demeke Consultancy, without a competitive public bid, while Gezahegn is charged for allegedly receiving construction work for Gilgel Beles upon paying three million Birr to Yaregal and Habtamu, in kickbacks. Mekbib Moges is also charged for receiving the construction work of Assosa TVET, paying 700,000 Br to Yaregal in bribes."270,The Namibian (Windhoek),3/1/12,Jacobs's Corruption Case Postponed,,NAMIBIA (93%); GERMANY (79%),Newspaper,Luqman Cloete,ENGLISH,,,1-Mar-12,,254 words,DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (91%); MAGISTRATES (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (53%); CATERING SERVICES (51%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"KEETMANSHOOP Regional Court Magistrate Sunsley Zisengwe yesterday granted another postponement at the request of former Karas chief regional officer Salmaan Jacobs, who faces five counts of corruption. It was Jacobs's second appearance in court this week. Zisengwe on Monday ordered Jacobs to obtain legal representation within 24 hours. Jacobs told the court that his previous lawyer, Lot Haifidi, had withdrawn from the case because of ""miscommunications"" over his fees. Zisengwe yesterday granted a final postponement until July 30 following a written request by Haifidi to postpone the case to allow Jacobs to raise the money he owed him [Haifidi] for three months of legal representation. Haifidi said he could not proceed with the trial this week because he is busy with High Court cases. State Prosecutor Veiko Alexander did not oppose the postponement although he indicated that the State was ready to proceed. Jacobs, who now holds a senior position in the Foreign Affairs Ministry, allegedly defrauded the Karas Regional Council of close to N$32 000 after he had claimed N$49 020 for attending a month-long, all-expenses-paid workshop in Germany. Two other counts originated from a catering contract Jacobs had awarded as the council's tender board chairman to Sadadi Enterprise, a company he had an interest in, in October and November 2006. The remaining count stems from a payment made from the Karas Regional Council's account to Sadadi Enterprise on the pretext that the money was meant for a community garden at Berseba."271,The Namibian (Windhoek),3/13/12,"Anti-Corruption Commission Probes Sorensen, Amunyela Land Deal",,NAMIBIA (94%),Newspaper,Denver Kisting,ENGLISH,,,13-Mar-12,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (72%)",540 words,CORRUPTION (92%); INVESTIGATIONS (91%); EXTORTION (90%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (87%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); LAWYERS (77%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (75%); EXECUTIVES (73%); RACISM & XENOPHOBIA (72%); RESTAURANTS (72%); RURAL COMMUNITIES (59%) Namibia; Land and Rural Issues; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"PAULUS Noa, the director of the Anti-Corruption Commission, yesterday confirmed that the ACC is investigating a land deal between businessmen Vincent Sorensen and Desmond Amunyela. Noa said the aim is to get to the bottom of allegations made in extortion claims against Amunyela. ""We want to establish whether proper procedures were followed,"" he said. In an affidavit, property bigwig Sorensen claims that Amunyela wanted to extort money from him. He wants the Police to investigate this alleged extortion and corruption. Amunyela denied the allegations. Late last year, Amunyela dragged AroVin to court for N$1,4 million, which Amunyela claims is owed to him in compensation for a property deal in 2007. Amunyela, an executive director at Paragon Investment Holdings, said he facilitated a deal for a Kleine Kuppe property in 2007 for AroVin - an outfit jointly owned by Sorensen and Aaron Mushimba. Sorensen paid N$700 000 to Amunyela in March last year after the two met following an allegedly racist incident in a local restaurant. Sorensen stated in court documents last year that he made the payment after Amunyela had promised to withdraw criminal charges against him. Sorensen further claimed that Amunyela undertook to use ""his newspaper"", the Windhoek Observer, to try and restore Sorensen's name. But, according to Sorensen's latest affidavit, it appears that Amunyela had no such plans and in fact allegedly wanted to extort more money from him. In October last year in the High Court, Sisa Namandje, Amunyela's lawyer, said claims that Sorensen made the N$700 000 payment under duress should be ignored, as there was no actual violence or reasonable fear. Moreover, relying on Amunyela withdrawing criminal charges against Sorensen for an alleged racist incident would ""amount to a crime of compounding in our law"" as the Prosecutor General has the final authority on case withdrawals in Namibia, Namandje told Acting Judge Andrew Corbett. In February last year, Sorensen drove past Paragon Investment Holdings ""and noticed a massive depiction of erstwhile President Sam Nujoma displayed on the face of the building with the words 'let the revolution continue' displayed above it"". He says he ""was irked by the display, as it is [his] belief that Mr Amunyela's ill-placed public purported devotion to the founding father of Namibia is aimed at furthering his own considerable political and financial ambitions"". Later that evening, Sorensen was dining at O'Portuga restaurant when he noticed that Amunyela was also there. He sent Amunyela a handwritten note which stated: ""Desmond, the effigy of our founding president is impressive. Unfortunately, the fact that your head is not visibly sticking out of his ass is unrealistic."" The result of this incident was a public debacle during which Joel Kaapanda, the Minister of Information and Communication Technology, also lashed out at Sorensen. Amunyela's lawyer earlier said the N$700 000 payment was the first instalment of the N$2,1 million commission owed to Amunyela for his role in the tender process of the erf for AroVin. According to Noa, it is this deal that they are probing. He could not say how long the investigation would take. The judgment in the civil matter has not been delivered yet."272,The Namibian (Windhoek),3/22/12,Corruption in Country 'Chronic',,NAMIBIA (96%),Newspaper,Denver Kisting,ENGLISH,,,22-Mar-12,,266 words,CORRUPTION (92%); ELECTIONS (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (75%); VOTERS & VOTING (71%); REFUGEES (69%) Namibia; Corruption,"THE Namibian Government pays mere lip service to the fight against corruption and graft has become ""chronic"", Jesaya Nyamu, Rally for Democracy and Progress (RDP) secretary general, said this week.

Also, the opposition leader said, Namibians need ""to stand up and join us in the relentless fight against corruption"". Apart from graft, Namibians also battle to cope with ""rampant unemployment and poverty"". Nyamu further urged Government ""to show compassion and leniency"" and ensure that Namibian refugees are repatriated. The RDP praised Namibians for having maintained peace and stability over the past 22 years.

Pretending to be the investigating officer in the matter, Maronda telephoned Marbach, informing her that she would not be able to return to her homeland with the pending theft case unless she paid him N$2 000. If she paid him, he would close the case against her. If she did not want to play along, he threatened to arrest her. She gave in to the threat, and the two agreed to meet in Omaruru at the Spar Supermarket, where she would pay him in cash. But she paid him only N$1 000, and promised to pay the rest at a later stage. Maronda met her dressed in full police uniform when he took the money. After the meeting, Marbach informed the local police and Maronda was arrested and charged under the Anti-Corruption Act.

Mr Chikwanda has also called for implementation of recommendations of audit reports from the Office of the Auditor General. The minister said it was not enough for internal auditors to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of operations in institutions without follow-up actions. He said some controlling officers did not appreciate the role of audit committees in the Government and that there was need for a change in attitude and work culture. The minister was speaking at an internal audit forum in Lusaka called to look at effective internal controls and public audit committees. Mr Chikwanda said managements in Government institutions were expected to demonstrate a high level of accountability and transparency in the use of public resources. There would be no accountability, he said, without a strong relationship between the Government and external accountability bodies such as the office of the Auditor General, Parliament, audit committees, civil society organisations and the media. Mr Chikwanda said it was against this background that the Government had facilitated the inclusion of the controller of audits as a permanent witness at the public accounts committee (PAC) to strengthen good corporate governance practices and promote accountability in the use of public resources. ""We need to know whether internal accountability is an underestimated issue in Zambia's Government institutions. This will also help inform the public about internal accountability and create awareness on the role of internal audits,"" Mr Chikwanda said.

This came to light yesterday when Justice Minister, Sebastian Zulu, presented the revised Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) Bill of 2012 in Parliament. Possession of wealth that was not commensurate with one's earnings has been criminalised under the new proposed law in an effort to promote transparency. He said the 10 years maximum jail term did not work as a deterrent enough and urged parliamentarians to support the Bill which went through second reading. Mr Zulu said corruption distorted the economy by increasing the levels of poverty not only in Zambia but all-over the world.Article 35 of the ACC Act was removed by the MMD government, a move Mr Zulu said was against the aspirations of the Zambian people. He said Parliament should help send a message that corruption would not be tolerated in line with the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Protocol on corruption. Mr Zulu said the new Act also guaranteed the security of tenure for the director general of the ACC and provided steps for the removal of the office holder to avoid abuse. Bweengwa MP Highvie Hamududu told the House that United Party for National Development MPs had resolved to support the Bill because the party held that position even before the elections last year. Legal Affairs Parliamentary Committee chairperson, Jack Mwiimbu, who is Monze Central MP, said stakeholders had made it clear during sittings that they wanted section 35 of the Act reinstated to stiffen the fight against corruption. Meanwhile, Education Minister, John Phiri told Parliament in a ministerial statement that the three Zambian students who were beaten up in Russia during a drinking spree were in serious condition and that one of them had his skull broken. Dr Phiri said four suspects had been arrested by Russian police but court proceedings could not commence because of the condition of the three students. Dr Phiri said Christopher Bwanga sustained a broken skull while Crispin Bwanga had his jaw broken. Leonard Kawanga sustained a deep cut on the head and they were all admitted to a hospital within St Petersburg city. The incident happened on March 18, 2012 when the three went to a bar where a fracas ensued with some ladies and others joined in. Three other Zambians escaped unhurt. And Government is considering the possibility of taking punitive action against management at Chizongwe High Technical School for acting negligently when the pupils mobilised themselves and walked eight kilometers to Chipata town to damage property at Anoya Zulu Secondary School. Dr Phiri said the matter would be investigated to establish whether or not there was negligence on the part of management because it was unlikely that the pupils could evade detection during their plans. Mr Phiri said all the pupils involved in the destruction would be surcharged and that management would determine the modalities. Both Chizongwe and Chiwala Secondary Schools would re-open three weeks earlier than other schools. And Deputy Minister in the Office of the Vice-President, Edgar Lungu, said the eight former district commissioners in Eastern Province had not been fired but removed pending redeployment. This was in response to a question by Malambo MP Maxwell Mwale who had asked the Vice-President's office how many district commissioners had been fired and for what reasons. Home Affairs Minister Kennedy Sakeni told the House that two inmates from Lusaka Central Prison died at the University Teaching Hospital early this month due to cerebra edema and intracerebral haedoorage. He was responding to a question by Kasenegwa MP Victoria Kalima who wanted to know whether the ministry was aware that four inmates died of poisoning at Mukobeko maximum prison."276,The Herald (Harare),4/5/12,Corruption Corrodes Judiciary,,ZIMBABWE (93%),Newspaper,Daniel Nemukuyu,ENGLISH,,,5-Apr-12,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (90%)",636 words,ETHICS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); JUDICIAL ETHICS (78%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (78%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (77%); VERDICTS (77%); FINES & PENALTIES (71%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"ZIMBABWE'S judiciary is terribly under-funded, fuelling corruption in the justice delivery system, Chief Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku has said. Addressing delegates at the official launch of the code of ethics for judges and the JSC's strategic plan in Harare, Chief Justice Chidyausiku said under-funding also hindered the judiciary's capacity to deliver. ""The judiciary is terribly under-funded. This has seriously impaired the capacity of the judiciary to deliver justice. ""The under-funding has also contributed in a large measure to corruption in the judiciary, especially at the lower levels of the judiciary. ""Regrettably, the Judicial Service Commission has had to accept that the judiciary will never be adequately funded. JSC has no choice but to learn to live with under-funding."" ""I am extremely concerned at the reports of corruption in the judiciary. These reports, in the main, relate to the lower levels of the judiciary,"" he said. The Chief Justice proposed improvement of the working conditions for judicial officers and support staff as one of the ways of reducing corruption. ""Put differently, the Judicial Service Commission believes that corruption can be rooted out by a policy of 'carrot and stick'. ""Wielding the stick alone without the carrot is unlikely to achieve the desired result."" The Chief Justice suggested the imposition of severe penalties for those found guilty of corruption as another measure to stem the rot. Justice and Legal Affairs Minister Patrick Chinamasa said corruption was rife in the judiciary and JSC should work towards curbing it. ""It cannot be denied that corruption is a cancerous cell eating away the fabric of our justice delivery system. The JSC must initiate strategies to fight it, to eliminate it. 'Judiciary requires adequate funding' ""There should be zero tolerance to corruption. I always put it this way: While I can live with the outcome of a court judgment that is bad in law and with a factual basis which has been erroneously arrived at due to incompetence of a judicial officer, I cannot live with an outcome of judgment that has been bought,"" said Minister Chinamasa. He said he had received reports and complaints from the public accusing the judiciary and other court officials of corruption. ""I receive complaints almost daily from members of the public about the shortcomings of our justice delivery system. ""I routinely pass these (complaints) to the Acting Secretary of JSC Mrs Rita Makarau. ""Members of the public complain about inordinate delays in finalising court matters. They complain of delays in handing down judgments. Allegations have been made that some judgments have taken up to six years to hand down. ""I have received complaints galore about court records that develop legs and surreptitiously walk away,"" said Minister Chinamasa. He said there were reports of important documents that were plucked away from court records. ""More seriously, members of the public allege rampant corruption in the courts involving all key players in the justice delivery system. (They include) judicial officers and support staff, clerks, interpreters and the lot of police investigating officers, prosecutors, lawyers in the private sector not to mention touts who impersonate lawyers, prison officers whether in civil and criminal matters,"" said the minister. The code of ethics, according to the minister, is set to address corruption and other concerns. ""The judicial code of ethics half addresses my concerns. ""I say 'half addresses' because this is just a small albeit significant step towards eliminating corruption or the perception of corruption in the justice system,"" said Minister Chinamasa. He urged the commission to methodically and systematically implement the strategic plan and the code of ethics for the betterment of the justice delivery system."277,The Namibian (Windhoek),4/11/12,Corruption Perceived as Very High,,NAMIBIA (95%),Newspaper,Catherine Sasman,ENGLISH,,,11-Apr-12,,474 words,CORRUPTION (91%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); POLLS & SURVEYS (78%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (78%); PRIME MINISTERS (78%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (78%); BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (77%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (77%); DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS (77%); POLITICS (76%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (76%); INTELLIGENCE SERVICES (70%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (68%); SOCIAL SECURITY (66%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (61%); US SOCIAL SECURITY (56%) Namibia; Corruption,"MORE than half of Namibians think corruption in the country is very high, while 64 per cent feel that it is not acceptable for a leader to acquire wealth through corruption. This is according to the latest urban corruption perception report compiled by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) after a survey carried out in all 13 political regions during March last year. The Ministry of Finance was perceived as the most corrupt (11,6 per cent), followed by Home Affairs (9,9%), Safety and Security (9,6 per cent), Education (8,2 per cent), Defence (8 per cent), and Works and Transport (5,7 per cent). Perceived to be least corrupt are the Office of the Auditor General and the Namibia Central Intelligence Service (both at 0,1 per cent), the Office of the President (0,3 per cent), Office of the Prime Minister and the ACC both at 0,4 per cent, and Parliament at 0,5 per cent. Respondents felt that the Government Institutions Pension Fund (GIPF) is the most corrupt institution in Namibia (at 37,7 per cent), followed by the Social Security Commission (9,4 per cent) and the Namibia Traffic Information System (Natis) at 8,1 per cent. Those institutions considered least corrupt are the local authority councils and the Ministry of Defence (both at 4,8 per cent). Corruption at State schools is perceived to have dropped, but more than 40 per cent of the respondents felt that teachers are involved in corruption, followed by nurses (35,8 per cent), and Police officers (34,7 per cent). Those professions viewed as least corrupt are parliamentarians (3,2 per cent), lawyers (3,6 per cent), and business people (3,8 per cent). Respondents felt that greed is at the core of corruption, but that poverty and poor pay also contribute. Most felt that the corruption-busting initiatives of the ACC are effective, with 24,8 per cent believing that the level of corruption has decreased. More than 30 per cent based their responses on corruption on media reports, 22 per cent on personal experience, 9,5 per cent on discussions with friends, 7,8 per cent on information emanating from the ACC, and 1,3 per cent on information from politicians. The ACC reported that it effectively investigated 297 reports of alleged corrupt practices during the 2011/12 financial year. During that period, it referred 55 cases to the office of the Prosecutor General with recommendations for prosecution. For the 2012/13 financial year, the ACC has requested N$700 000 for investigating allegations of corruption, and a further N$750 000 to establish and implement measures to prevent corruption. The bulk of its budgetary request for the new financial year - N$48,9 million - is for its coordination and support programme. This covers the management and deployment of human and other resources, training within the ACC, and the provision of suitable working environments for its staff."278,The Herald (Harare),4/20/12,"No Corruption in Willowvale Flats Allocation, Says Mutsekwa",,ZIMBABWE (94%),Newspaper,Farirai Machivenyika,ENGLISH,,,20-Apr-12,,499 words,CORRUPTION (92%); AGREEMENTS (90%); CIVIL SERVICES (89%); PUBLIC HOUSING (89%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (78%); DEVELOPMENT BANKS (78%); BRIBERY (77%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (75%); REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT (75%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (73%); INFRASTRUCTURE (72%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Governance,"HOUSING and Social Amenities Minister Giles Mutsekwa says he will deal with any irregular allocation of houses under the Willowvale Flats Phase Two Housing Projects. The minister denied allegations of corruption in selecting beneficiaries. He was responding to the first report of the Portfolio Committee on Public Works and National Housing on Phase 11 Willowvale Housing Projects. Minister Mutsekwa denied assertions by the committee that the project was meant for the poor. He said the project was implemented on a commercial basis as contained in the agreement between Government and the Infrastructure Development Bank of Zimbabwe. ""The vetting of candidates is an on-going process and not an event considering that we need to approach the respective local authority and the Deeds Office. In the event that we subsequently discover that some beneficiaries did not meet the requirements we can still deal with them as per clause 14.1,"" he said. The clause states that false declaration by an individual that they do not own any other property would result in cancellation of the agreement of sale. He cited a case in which some agreements had been cancelled because the persons had made false declarations while in some the beneficiaries were minors. On allegations of corruption, Minister Mutsekwa said there was no evidence to substantiate these claims. ""I am disturbed by the use of the word corruption in the report, which according to my definition means an act or practice of giving or accepting a bribe or moral pervasion of integrity. ""There is no substantial information to back up this allegation,"" he said. The minister said the programme was established in 2010 with Government setting aside US$25 million to create the National Housing Development Loan Facility drawn from the International Monetary Fund Special Drawing Rights to Zimbabwe. He said the money was set aside as a Revolving Fund targeting people who could afford. The ministry, IBDZ, local authorities and other private players would then identify suitable land for development and provide on-site infrastructure. Minister Mutsekwa said some of the projects identified included Willowvale Phase 11, Mbizo 22 in Kwekwe, Chikanga in Mutare, Lower Paradise in Marondera, Parklands in Bulawayo while four other projects in Chiredzi, Masvingo, Gwanda and Makonde had been identified for possible development. He said the disparities in deposit paid were a result of affordability. ""Some of the civil servants who were nominated by their ministries could and afford were given first preference to pay the commercial deposit of US$10 000. This explains why we have civil servants who paid different deposits of US$3 600 and US$10 000,"" he said. In its report the committee urged Government to reverse the allocation of the flats saying the criteria excluded the intended beneficiaries, the poor and civil servants. The committee also questioned the existence of children some of them as young as 10 years on the beneficiaries' list."279,The Herald (Harare),4/25/12,Corruption At GMB,,ZIMBABWE (93%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,25-Apr-12,,165 words,INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); AGRICULTURAL MARKETING (88%); IRRIGATION (73%); SECONDARY SCHOOLS (53%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Governance,"THE Zanu-PF Mashonaland Central provincial leadership has urged Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development Minister Joseph Made to launch investigations into the operations of the Grain Marketing Board in the province.

""There is corruption and we want the minister to investigate this,"" said Cde Mafios. He was addressing hundreds of people who converged at Mt Darwin Secondary School to witness the launch of the First Choice Wholesale scheme.

At the start of the trial, Boois pleaded not guilty to charges of corruption but admitted that he received the housing subsidy while he stayed in a Government house.

This revelation comes in the wake of persistent claims of irregularities at the uranium giant. One of the latest casualties of allegations of misconduct is Jan Groenewaldt. Although the company has drawn a veil of secrecy around his dismissal, this superintendent of contractor management, was fired recently. Noa could however not say if the ACC probe had anything to do with Groenewaldt, as he was not in office. When approached for comment about Groenewaldt more than a week ago, the mine's spokesperson, Jerome Mutumba, denied that he had been sacked. ""As far as I am concerned, he is still an employee of the company. What I can tell you at this stage is that all employee issues are internal matters."" ""But should, at any given stage, an employee cease to be an employee, then I can confirm that he is no longer an employee."" Last week, Mutumba said he was on leave and referred all further queries to Chris Salisbury, the managing director. Salisbury was equally evasive. All he was prepared to say was: ""I have the policy of not commenting on specific employee matters."" Groenewaldt, on his part, fumed that his employment situation had nothing to do with anybody. ""What does it have to do with anyone? So what? I don't need to respond to your questions."" The Namibian was reliably informed that he was given the boot after being found guilty on two charges - conflict of interest as well as receiving a gift from a contractor ""which is tantamount to corruption"". Details about the charges remain sketchy. Groenewaldt, it is understood, maintains that he is innocent and has lodged an appeal against his dismissal. Mutumba earlier this year also vehemently denied media reports that there was a large-scale fraud investigation underway at the mine. This seems to be in contradiction to Noa's confirmation yesterday. In December, The Namibian reported that R_ssing's former financial heavyweight, Peter Carlson, also resigned under a cloud. His resignation came amid claims that he was demoted in the wake of alleged irregularities found during an audit. Carlson had served the uranium giant as chief financial officer (CFO) since 2006. Late in 2011, he was moved to the position of chief control officer (CCO). This was seen as a demotion, as he had to report to the CFO. The company is still trying to fill the CFO position. Richard Niddrie has been acting as CFO. On November 25 last year, Salisbury informed its employees that Carlson had resigned. ""Peter Carlson has decided to leave R_ssing to pursue other interests. I wish him every success for the future."" Carlson ""will report to me until further notice"", Salisbury's note read. At the time both Mutumba, and Carlson were tight-lipped about the reason for Carlson's resignation. All Mutumba had to say was: ""I confirm Mr Carlson tendered his resignation from the company on a voluntary basis. The company wishes him all the best in his future endeavours."" The Namibian wanted to know specifically from Mutumba whether he could confirm that Carlson's resignation followed after a demotion based on alleged irregularities including authorising ""enormous bonuses"" during 2010. Carlson said that he was ""not in a position to talk about that right now"". The position of CCO also still remains vacant following Carlson's resignation."282,The Namibian (Windhoek),5/8/12,Anti-Corruption Commission Mum On R_ssing Probe,,NAMIBIA (94%),Newspaper,Denver Kisting,ENGLISH,,,8-May-12,,666 words,INVESTIGATIONS (91%); CORRUPTION (91%); EMPLOYEE DEMOTIONS (89%); CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (89%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); FINANCIAL CRIME COUNTERMEASURES (78%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); DISMISSALS (76%); RESIGNATIONS (76%); CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (74%); MINES & MINING (72%); BANKING & FINANCE (69%); TAX LAW (68%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (63%); INCOME TAX (54%); APPEALS (50%) Namibia; Company News; Corruption,"THE director of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), Paulus Noa, yesterday said he cannot reveal more details about their investigation at R_ssing Uranium Limited.

Yesterday, Noa said: ""I'm not in a position where we can share even an iota of information with you. We are busy with the investigation."" R_ssing had been facing the heat on various fronts lately, including reports of the demotion of a senior official after alleged irregularities were found during an audit. Also questions have been raised about an alleged attempt by the company to benefit from its employees pension fund surplus, which according to experts is against the Income Tax Act. R_ssing Uranium Limited spokesperson Jerome Mutumba yesterday said they were unaware of any ACC investigation. ""The company is not formally aware of any ongoing or pending ACC investigation as reported in the media today (yesterday). However, should it be the case, it will fully cooperate and support any formal investigation by any relevant authority."" According to Mutumba, they are ""quite confident in our internal governance systems that are regularly audited"". Asked specifically whether the company is reviewing its tender policies because of allegations that there is a lack of transparency, Mutumba did not respond. One source said: ""We are busy checking our tender processes also. It is not that transparent for a corporate company."" Yesterday, it was reported that the company recently sacked its contractor management superintendent, Jan Groenewaldt.

Groenewaldt, it is understood, maintains that he is innocent and has lodged an appeal against his dismissal. Mutumba earlier this year also vehemently denied media reports that there was a large-scale fraud investigation underway at the mine.

In December, The Namibian reported that R_ssing's former financial heavyweight, Peter Carlson, also resigned under a cloud of speculation. His resignation came amidst claims that he was demoted in the wake of alleged irregularities found during an audit. Last week it was reported that R_ssing, one of the mainstays of Namibia's mining sector, that it wants to dip into its employee pension fund. A proposed rule change to the R_ssing's Pension Fund has been described by some in the financial industry as a smokescreen to allow the company to access at least one third of the fund's surplus, which stood at N$412,5 million in March last year. Allowing the company to lay its hands on the surplus, some pension fund experts say, would contravene the Income Tax Act of 1981, which stipulates that the employer should be precluded from controlling the management of assets of a pension fund from ""deriving any monetary advantage from moneys paid into or out of the fund, except where the employer is a partnership"". Over the past two years there had been negotiations between R_ssing, the Mineworkers Union of Namibia and the trustees of the fund over the surplus and a decision had been taken on how it should be distributed. It is now up to the trustees to effect the rule change, which must be endorsed by the company, as it ""underwrites the costs and benefits promised by the fund and has to agree any benefit improvement"", principal officer of the fund, Erich Beukes told The Namibian last week. R_ssing and its employees have been on a pension contribution holiday since 1992, because of a healthy surplus in the fund. Also, it was reported recently that a cloud of uncertainty hangs over the heads of R_ssing Foundation employees. At least eight foundation employees are expected to be laid off. R_ssing had not contributed any funds to the foundation since 2009."283,The Herald (Harare),5/16/12,Paltry Salaries Threaten Anti-Corruption War - Commission,,ZIMBABWE (93%),Newspaper,Zvamaida Murwira,ENGLISH,,,16-May-12,,333 words,CORRUPTION (94%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); BRIBERY (78%); WAGES & SALARIES (74%); CONSTITUTIONAL LAW (63%); IMMIGRATION (50%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE independence and effectiveness of the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission is under threat as officials earning US$250 per month are tasked to investigate cases involving millions of dollars, an official said on Monday. Commission chairperson Mr Denford Chirindo said there was need to introduce an anti-corruption risk allowance for his officers to ""insulate"" them from the temptation. Mr Chirindo was giving oral evidence before the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Defence and Home Affairs. The parliamentary committee chaired by Mount Darwin East MP Cde Dickson Mafios (Zanu-PF) wanted to be updated on the commission's operations and challenges. ""Our staff earn an average of US$250 a month,"" said Mr Chirindo. ""We believe this does not insulate them against corruption. They are vulnerable to bribes given that they are supposed to pursue cases involving millions of dollars."" Mr Chirindo said there was need for additional funding to improve conditions of service for staff in the commission. Secretary for Home Affairs Mr Melusi Matshiya said he will make presentations to Treasury to allow the commission to retain a portion of the money recovered in their investigations. ""It's a formula we have used in my department. We have done that with the Registrar-General's office and they are doing well, the same with Immigration and they have bought uniforms. ""We have also done that with the police and if the Anti-Corruption Commission is allowed to retain, say, US$100 000 of a million they recover, you are then achieving their independence,"" he said. On the independence of the commission, Mr Chirindo said while the Constitution provides that they should be independent, the fact that they report to Parliament through a line ministry created problems. He said the Prevention of Corruption Act, which was being administered by the Ministry of Home Affairs, saw a department being created to administer and implement the Act, but in their view it is now running parallel to their commission."284,The Namibian (Windhoek),5/18/12,Stop Politicising Corruption [opinion],,NAMIBIA (94%),Newspaper,Christof Maletsky,ENGLISH,,,23-May-12,,515 words,CORRUPTION (91%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); BUDGETS (77%); BRIBERY (73%); TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT (71%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (60%); TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (60%); INTERNATIONAL TOURISM (55%) Namibia; Corruption,"I AM seriously depressed. The alarming rate of corruption in Namibia is getting to me. Almost on a daily basis the media report about one or other corruption case. The only difference is that it started with hundreds being stolen, but now it is no longer hundreds or even thousands. Millions disappear overnight and some people become rich just as quickly. When you see your neighbour suddenly (whether a casual worker or clergyman) giving a huge facelift to his house, buying a top of the range vehicle or taking the family on a foreign trip, you immediately suspect that they must have laid their hands on millions. And it is not a jackpot they have won! It has become a tough task looking for people who systematically work their way up to riches in Namibia. Many opt for the quick fix including stealing, bribery and other forms of corruption. Worse still, many of us admire those who become rich overnight without even questioning how they achieved it. For many young people, they become their role models. Of late it has become a norm for people in key positions at Government ministries, parastatals or even in the private sector to scheme about how they can enrich themselves instead of ensuring efficient service delivery. Networks are formed and millions move between accounts while some turn a blind eye. In fact, I can safely say that some of these syndicates own our leaders! As soon as the leaders smell the rat, they are made to benefit (in most cases indirectly) even if it is just the crumbs falling from the tables. In the most recent instances tenders are not only given fraudulently but the work is either not started or is incomplete despite payments having been made. Worst is that procedures are not followed to first inspect the work or that payments are signed off by those connected to the tenderers. Surely they must be getting something in return. We have had reports of money being transferred between accounts and as it is moved, the amount gets less because people take their share of the cake. Such corruption delays service delivery and promotes poverty in a country which is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on Corruption; where our leaders have declared zero tolerance on corruption; and where we have established an organisation governed by the laws to fight corruption. One gets the impression that ours is just a token commitment. In the early 1990s over-expenditure was first regarded as going over budget, but now it should constitute corruption because, for instance, accounting officers and others in key decision-making positions deliberately go for more expensive tenders so that they can benefit in the process. The corrupt tenderers will not pay from their own money. Will they? They will always recover it through inflated prices. Therefore, even if we have the Anti-Corruption Commission or the President shouting loudly about zero tolerance, it does not automatically translate into good action or minimise the problem. In fact, some of those who shout the loudest are among the main culprits. It's time to let them know that they have gone too far."285,The New Times (Kigali),5/19/12,Call for Private Sector-Led Effort to Stem Corruption,,RWANDA (94%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%),Newspaper,James Karuhanga,ENGLISH,,,19-May-12,,378 words,CORRUPTION (95%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (91%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); EXECUTIVES (78%); TALKS & MEETINGS (77%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (77%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (73%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (72%); PRIME MINISTERS (72%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (71%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (50%) Rwanda; Corruption,"The Private Sector recognises the importance of a corrupt-free society, and will do whatever it can to fight graft, Hannington Namara, the CEO of the Private Sector Federation (PSF) said, yesterday, in response to recommendations from a lawmakers' meeting on corruption.

""When it comes to fighting corruption, there is a need to put things in context. One good way is putting in place a stringent legal framework and, the private sector would be very happy to oblige because we are the ones who suffer most.

""We are willing to back the efforts that the legislative body is putting in place so as to have what I would call a seamless arrangement."" The meeting at parliament was organised by the African Parliamentarians' Network against Corruption (APNAC), the continent's leading network of parliamentarians against corruption. It also called for more collaboration with the judiciary in combating the vice, as well as in sharing information on related crimes. Other suggestions include: perfecting the role and collaboration between government, the civil society and nongovernmental organisations; urging relevant authorities not to accept any forms of corruption usually falsely linked to the culture of showing appreciation through 'gifts'; and sensitising all administrative entities to provide good services. Opening the meeting, the Prime Minister, Dr Pierre Damien Habumuremyi, noted that despite the country's unrelenting war on corruption, new strategies were required to eliminate the remaining traces. Rwanda is ranked fourth least corrupt African country by, the World Bank, and the least corrupt country in the East African Community bloc.

Mr Sata said such laws should not be driven by selfish interests but by patriotism and professionalism. He said heads of State in Africa should step up the fight against corruption and help their anti-corruption agencies develop standard innovations in corruption prevention and investigation. Mr Sata said this at Zambezi Sun Hotel in Livingstone yesterday in a speech read for him by Home Affairs Minister, Kennedy Sakeni. This was during the official opening of the second Commonwealth Regional Conference for heads of anti-corruption agencies in Africa. The conference, held under the theme 'Critical role of innovations in fighting corruption in public administration in Africa', has attracted more than 60 delegates from several African countries. The President said corruption had remained a huge challenge to African countries and the world at large. ""The whole world is constantly checking on Africa to see if there is anything being done to redeem itself, and it is, therefore, time for Africa to develop individual citizens and empower them with adequate and correct information on corruption for them to make informed decisions. ""It is time for Africa to rise above official corruption where people are paid for no work done,"" Mr Sata said. He said there was need to empower staff in the public service with adequate information on corruption and acceptable values for them to manage public resources with accountability which would be accepted by citizens. ""In this regard, I am proud to inform you that a new law called the Anti-Corruption Act Number 3 of 2012 has since been enacted by the Zambian Parliament, repealing the old Act, Number 38 of 2010 which had removed the abuse of the authority clause. ""More importantly, the re-introduction of the Abuse of Authority of Office Clause in the Anti-Corruption Act will deter public officials from mismanaging and stealing public resources,"" he said. Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) Director General, Rosewin Wandi said the theme for the conference was timely in that it had come at a time when the world was undergoing fast transformation into a global village. Ms Wandi said that the world was dynamic as corrupt people were also becoming more sophisticated in their attempt to perpetuate corruption and other vices. She said corruption in the public sector weakened democratic institutions, encouraged organised crime and undermined as well as compromised public service delivery. Commonwealth Secretariat governance adviser, Rodger Koranteng said corruption had remained a huge barrier to economic growth. Dr Koranteng said the widespread perception in many nations indicated that the public sector had lost direction as a lot of people were corrupt."287,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),5/24/12,End Corruption in Councils - Sata,,ZAMBIA (93%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,24-May-12,"LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (93%)",525 words,REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (91%); CORRUPTION (90%); LAND USE PLANNING (90%); CITY GOVERNMENT (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (79%); INTERVIEWS (79%); GRANTS & GIFTS (78%); HOUSING AUTHORITIES (73%); CULTURE DEPARTMENTS (73%); CITIES (70%); CHILDREN (52%) Zambia; Corruption; Governance,"PRESIDENT Michael Sata has directed the newly-appointed Local Government Service Commission (LGSC) to address problems in land allocation which he said were responsible for the rampant corruption in councils. Mr Sata said local government had been ineffective for many years and that it was now the mandate of the new commission to make it effective. Mr Sata was speaking in Lusaka yesterday at State House when he swore-in chairperson of the commission, Steven Mushinge and his deputy, Charles Mwandila, who is former Mufulira Municipal Council town clerk. Mr Sata said councils countrywide were faced with numerous challenges such as corruption and other malpractices and that the commission needed to immediately address them. He said the commission should deal with land allocation which had become one area of concern and mired in corrupt practices. The members of the commission are Maggie Kapiya, Daubt Phiri and Bernard Simpokolwe, while Chipili Katunasa-Magayane is the commission secretary. Mr Simpokolwe is former permanent secretary in the Ministry of Sport, Youth and Child Development in the Frederick Chiluba administration. The President has also urged the commission to explore ways of making councils self-sustaining instead of depending on Government grants for operations. ""There is so much corruption in the councils particularly in the allocation of land. You don't have houses. Mr Chiluba sold all the houses. When there were houses, councils survived on those houses but now you don't have them. ""Find means and ways of making councils survive on their own instead of relying on grants from the Government,"" Mr Sata said. The President warned that he would dissolve the newly-appointed commission the moment it failed to perform. He said the commission should not limit its operations to Lusaka Province only but expected the members to vigorously tour all councils to establish councils' operational challenges. ""I will not hesitate to dissolve you. With the minister, I have no problems because I can change her any time but for you, I am going to waste time to swear you in again. ""Tour the whole country, move to rural councils, district councils, city councils and municipal councils and once they see you that's how they are going to function,"" Mr Sata said. ""The Superannuation Fund belongs to all workers. Don't just sit in your offices in Lusaka or Ndola. Use the money to tour the whole country and see for yourselves what's happening in the councils. ""Don't just make transfers from your offices because today we can't see the impact of the local government. The local government today is dead,"" Mr Sata said. Speaking in an interview with journalists shortly after she witnessed the swearing-in of the commission, Local Government and Housing Minister, Nkandu Luo said she was happy that her Ministry now had a commission. Professor Luo said the commission had a huge task of addressing challenges in areas of human resource capacity and fostering workers' positive attitude.

It wants all reports of forensic and presidential commissions of inquiry made public, and while the fight on corruption should intensify in all seriousness, it demands that national resources be equally distributed to all Namibians as far as mining and fishing rights, bursaries and board positions are concerned. Similarly, the PSUN wants Government to abolish 'camping allowances' for public servants to ensure that Regional Emergency Management Unit (REMU) employees have job security. Currently these REMU workers are being re-commissioned every year but they do not have any benefits or job security, said PSUN senior organiser Ujama Kahongoro. The PSUN, which estimates its membership at about 16 000, does not have a recognition agreement with Government, but demands to represent its members in disciplinary hearings, which is not allowed under the public service staff rules. According to these staff rules, said Kahongoro, unions are only allowed to sit in as observers at disciplinary hearings. Kahongoro claimed that the Namibia Public Workers Union (Napwu), which has a recognition agreement with Government, agreed on the staff rules ""in cahoots"" with Prime Minister Nahas Angula. ""We think Napwu is selling out the workers. There is no way that you can engage in an agreement that will affect workers,"" Kahongoro said. ""We will get our house in order and challenge Government to get a recognition agreement with us. We feel Napwu's recognition status has expired because its membership has reduced."" The union wants decent work to be a prerequisite for foreign direct investments in order to protect Namibian workers against exploitation by multinational companies."292,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),6/6/12,"By-Elections Product of Electoral Fraud, Corruption",,ZAMBIA (94%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,15-Jun-12,,646 words,ELECTIONS (94%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (93%); ELECTION FRAUD (91%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); PETITIONS (90%); BYELECTIONS (90%); ETHICS (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); ELECTION AUTHORITIES (89%); VOTERS & VOTING (89%); POLITICS (89%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (89%); ELECTION LAW (89%); POLITICAL PARTIES (78%); POLITICAL CANDIDATES (78%); POLLS & SURVEYS (77%); POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS (71%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (71%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (70%); RANKINGS (70%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (50%) Zambia; Corruption; Governance,"ZAMBIA has witnessed unprecedented levels of electoral fraud and corruption since the re-introduction of multi-party democracy in 1991, and this ugly syndrome continues to plague the electoral system in spite of determined attempts to eliminate the scourge. If any sordid evidence was needed about the prevalence of this scourge, the number of parliamentary election petitions filed by losing candidates, and the resultant nullification of results by the courts in the aftermath of last year's polls, is irrefutable proof that most elections were marred by rampant fraud and corruption. There were in excess of 50 election petitions filed in the High Court by aggrieved individuals who contested and 'lost' parliamentary polls but are challenging the results, and in a bulk of these cases, corruption is the predominant feature cited by the petitioners. This situation does not augur well for our nascent democracy, for it clearly shows that the will of the people continues to be subverted by some individuals who employ all sorts of crude and unethical practices during election campaigns. So far, a total of nine parliamentary election results have been nullified by the courts, triggering numerous by-elections that will gobble a colossal amount of public funds -- which should be channeled into various development programmes to ameliorate suffering being endured by those living in abject poverty. We concur with the Electoral Commission of Zambia which oversees elections that political parties, as the key stakeholders, should do more to ensure that contestants abide by the Electoral Code of Conduct Act and strive, as much as possible, to avoid blatant breaches of the law which lead to election petitions. Violence, intimidation, vote buying, use of public resources, which include the use of Government transport or vehicles belonging to parastatal firms to ferry voters to polling stations, are all prohibited under the Electoral Act. Sadly, breaches were routinely recorded in nearly every election that took place in the past when the then ruling MMD abused its incumbency through the use of public funds and Government vehicles--including Ministry of Health vehicles--which were used to transport their spin-doctors hired from abroad at exorbitant fees. It is not in dispute that violent conduct by some low-ranking political cadres is often perpetrated at the behest of senior party leaders who appear to give tacit approval to such uncouth methods of coercing the electorate to vote in a particular way. The Electoral Act also expressly forbids making 'false, defamatory or inflammatory allegations concerning any person or party in connection with an election."" Candidates are expected to dwell on substantive issues instead of engaging in character assassination. Contrary to the letter and spirit of the Act, the former ruling party concocted crude and vile propaganda against the then leading opposition candidate, who eventually triumphed in the presidential polls. Viewed from a different perspective, MMD's propaganda back-fired on the party as most people were able to see through the blatant lies spread by the then ruling elite hell- bent on winning votes by hook or crook. The level of impunity exhibited in the past, particularly by those who were privileged to occupy positions of power and influence, compromised the efficacy of election results and undermined the country's democracy. The subsequent nullification of some election results by courts of law should be viewed as a case of chickens coming home to roost. Some of the breaches committed by poll contestants and their agents were too serious to go unpunished. We hope what transpired in the past will provide valuable lessons to other aspiring candidates in the forth-coming by-elections and future polls. The will of the people should always prevail, but that can only happen in a free and fair contest."293,The Herald (Harare),6/12/12,SPB Admits to Corruption in Tender Awards,,CHINA (79%); ZIMBABWE (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,13-Jun-12,,517 words,LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); CONTRACT AWARDS (90%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (73%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"State Procurement Board chairman, Mr Charles Kuwaza, yesterday admitted that some of his officers corruptly awarded tenders to bidders. Appearing before the portfolio committee on Budget, Finance and Investment Promotion Mr Kuwaza said the SPB did not have enough staff to investigate if parastatals and ministries were following the law in procurement. The committee wanted the SPB chairman to clarify reports that some of his officers were corruptly awarding tenders. ""The possibility of corruption could be there at the evaluation stage where some people may see that a certain bidder has met all the specifications. They then phone that bidder asking for a payment to facilitate that they win the tender when the bidder was still going to win it because they have met all the requirements,"" Mr Kuwaza said. ""I can't say there is no corruption but what we want is that our officers should not abuse their positions. As a board our attitude is zero tolerance to corruption and our officers know that if they do it they will go to jail,"" he said. Legislators also asked Mr Kuwaza why his board ignored recommendations from ministries and parastatals on preferred bidders. Goromonzi North legislator Cde Paddy Zhanda (Zanu-PF) chairs the committee. "" . . . we have heard that some of your officers were taken to court over corruption,"" Cde Zhanda said. ""We heard that before results are opened, some people will already be knowing them."" Bulawayo South MP, Mr Eddie Cross (MDC-T), said the fact that the SPB did not take recommendations resulted in them awarding tenders to companies without capacity. He asked who was to blame if the SPB awarded tenders to under performing companies that will not deliver. Mr Kuwaza said they only awarded tenders on the basis of the criteria set out in the tender documents as long as the companies would have been pre-certified by their mother organisations. He said if the winning bidder failed to do the job, blame was supposed to be directed at the ministry or parastatal that draws contracts. Tsholotsho South legislator, Mr Maxwell Dube (MDC), asked Mr Kuwaza, if his board had been involved in the tendering process for the construction of the National Defence College along Mazowe Road. ""In the Act there is a provision on a general policy, which we receive from the President. You should ask the President's Office regarding that policy. As you may be aware Cabinet adopted the Look East policy and we are guided by that,"" Mr Kuwaza said. He said the board had not yet done due diligence on the project adding that he will raise it with the board. Legislators alleged that the contractor at the defence College imported all the equipment from China including labour. The MPs said there was need for a law spelling out that if a foreigner won a tender they were not supposed to bring some of the equipment that can be found locally. Mr Kuwaza said there was no industry to talk about because it had been affected by hyper-inflation. He said his board will not use the indigenisation and economic empowerment law to give tenders to local companies that did not have capacity."294,New Democrat (Monrovia),6/13/12,Fighting Corruption War,,LIBERIA (96%); UNITED STATES (94%); AFRICA (93%); CANADA (79%); NORTH AMERICA (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,13-Jun-12,,427 words,"LEGISLATIVE BODIES (91%); CORRUPTION (91%); TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); APPROPRIATIONS (78%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (76%); INTERGOVERNMENTAL TALKS (74%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (73%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (72%); UNEMPLOYED PERSONS (71%); HYDROELECTRIC POWER GENERATION (69%); HYDROELECTRIC POWER (67%); POWER PLANTS (67%); NATURAL RESOURCES (66%); EMBARGOES & SANCTIONS (65%); IMMIGRATION (62%) Liberia; Corruption; International Organizations and Africa; United States, Canada and Africa","There is need for both the Executive and Legislative Branches of the Liberian government to collaborate in fighting the corruption virus that is gnawing the fabric of the nation's coffers, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has stressed during an address to legislators accompanying President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf in America.

Also present during the meeting the Administrator of USAID, Mr. Rajiv Shah, who assured President Sirleaf that his Agency would operate differently in ensuring that projects are country-led. A meeting between President Sirleaf and Secretary of State Hilary Clinton at the State Department underscored similar issues as discussed with Vice President Biden, in which she also spoke of her second-term priorities, especially making the Mount Coffee hydro plant operational. Their discussions focused on Liberia's new three-year, medium-term budget, the proper use of Liberia's natural resources for the benefit of all Liberians, and the need to review the UN sanctions regime on Liberia regarding frozen assets and travel ban, among a wide range of topics. Earlier at their meeting, President Sirleaf assert that Liberia's laws are clear on the protection of the rights and choices of all citizens, and that those laws must be respected and implemented. During President Sirleaf's meeting with Vice President Biden at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, they discussed how to strengthen U.S.-Liberia bilateral relations through the establishment of a Bi-National Commission; the drawdown of UNMIL and the corresponding need to build up Liberia's security forces, particularly the Police and Immigration. According a dispatch from the presidential press secretary, both leader also discussed Liberia's successes and challenges, amongst the latter being the need for infrastructure, especially electricity, promotion of national development, and how to address youth unemployment. The President also underscored the need to restore the U.S. Administration's proposed 15 percent cut in its appropriations to Liberia, U.S. support for Liberia in its effort to achieve Compact status under the Millennium Challenge Corporation Initiative, Liberia's solidarity with other African nations fighting to preserve the third party fabric clause in the AGOA legislation."295,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),6/15/12,'End Corruption in Procurement System',,ZAMBIA (94%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,15-Jun-12,"LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (72%)",280 words,CORRUPTION (90%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (90%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (74%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (73%); EXECUTIVES (71%) Zambia; Corruption,"GOVERNMENT will ensure that corruption in the procurement system is stamped out, Works, Supply, Transport and Communications Minister, Yamfwa Mukanga, has said. Mr Mukanga said the Government would ensure that transparency and accountability were restored. The minister said this in Lusaka yesterday during the launch of the Zambian Public Procurement Monitoring Coalition (ZPPMC) watch group. He said efficient and effective procurement of public goods, works and services was crucial for ensuring good economic management. Mr Mukanga said the Government acknowledged the fact that public procurement played a critical role in developmental programmes and service delivery of the country. ""Our country needs a procurement system which is effective and efficient based on transparency, accountability and fairness in order to obtain value for money. ""Transparency and accountability is a sure way of lessening opportunity for corrupt practices in the procurement system,"" he said. He said the Government valued initiatives of ZPPMC whose mandate was to advocate and promote transparency and accountability in the procurement system. The Government, Mr Mukanga said, was committed to ensuring improved access to information on procurement of works and services. Transparency International Zambia executive director Goodwell Lungu, who is the coalition chairperson, said the group engaged in public contract monitoring because the country had lost colossal sums of public funds resulting from flouting of tender procedures by public officers over the years. He said the Auditor-General's report of 2010 indicated that failure to follow tender procedures resulted in many financial irregularities."296,The Herald (Harare),6/18/12,Massive Corruption Rocks Fuel Industry,,ZIMBABWE (98%); UNITED STATES (93%); MOZAMBIQUE (92%); ZAMBIA (79%); MALAWI (79%),Newspaper,Sydney Kawadza and Tendai Mugabe,ENGLISH,,INDIAN OCEAN (92%),19-Jun-12,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (92%)",911 words,ENERGY & UTILITY LAW (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); MARINE TANKERS (89%); OIL & GAS MARINE TANKERS (89%); OIL & GAS INDUSTRY (78%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (77%); ENERGY & UTILITY REGULATION & POLICY (76%); ENERGY REGULATION (76%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (76%); PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (76%); ENERGY & UTILITY POLICY (76%); SPECIAL FREIGHT TRUCKING (75%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (74%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (69%); TRUCK DRIVERS (67%); QUALITY CONTROL (60%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Petroleum,"Zimbabwe's fuel industry, which is backed by a readily available cash-market, has become the latest target of a heavily pirated market with corrupt activities prejudicing the State of millions of US dollars. Investigations by The Herald have unearthed a cartel of fuel barons whose network involves fuel suppliers, transporters and local dealers. According to sources, the ""pirates"" are not only on the high seas of the Indian Ocean, but include players from the oil wells, the ships, the Port of Beira in Mozambique, transport companies and their representatives and shadow companies that market the product in Zimbabwe. Government and its regulatory authorities have, however, expressed ignorance to these activities. Energy and Power Development Minister Elton Mangoma yesterday said Government would be eager to investigate the activities. The Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority also expressed interest in taking up the issue. Zera commercial director Mr Eddie Mazambani said the authority would look into the allegations. The fuel industry acknowledged the proliferation of unregistered fuel dealers but blamed it on truck drivers who siphon fuel from tankers. The industry, which does not have representation after the collapse of its association, however questions dealers' preference of road transport to the cheaper Feruka Pipeline. Sources in the industry said unscrupulous elements have taken over the fuel industry taking advantage of the prevailing cash economy. ""There is nowhere else in the world where the United States dollar can exchange hands easily and the fuel barons have descended on Zimbabwe for their activities,"" a source said. He said Zimbabwe, as a transit route to markets in Zambia, DRC and Malawi, has been severely affected. ""There are pirates everywhere and they have found a home in Zimbabwe. One wonders why there has been a serious investment in the transport sector to service road (fuel) transportation when Government invested in the cheaper pipeline between Beira and Msasa, Harare. ""Dirty money is exchanging hands from dealers in oil producing countries, Beira, Harare and finally the shadowy retailers sprouting all over the country."" He said the deals also involve some Government officials who have jumped onto the bandwagon. There are allegations the people involved continue to shun the Feruka Pipeline for the lucrative road transport using their tankers. ""There has been an increase in road transport with tankers criss-crossing the Eastern parts of Zimbabwe to Mozambique for the ready cash,"" the source said. There is also a deliberate move, according to sources, to avoid the Feruka Pipeline as it is controlled especially for quality control measures. ""There are serious concerns that the dealers have opted for road transport because of the loopholes in quality control checks. The pipeline is strictly monitored and Zimbabwe could be receiving contaminated fuel,"" a source said. The sources said unregistered operators are also involved in a scam where fuel enters Zimbabwe disguised as being in transit. ""Government does not collect duty for fuel in transit but the bulk of this fuel has found its way onto the local market especially the unmarked service stations in Harare. ""There are fears that some of those trucks coming into Zimbabwe could have been improperly cleared at the border as carrying fuel for the Zambian or DRC market but most of it ends up in Harare because there are no clear mechanisms to track the vehicles to their final destinations."" There has also been a stampede to invest in the transport sector as businesspeople discovered the loopholes. ""Business including people in Government has joined the fray using their trucks and companies to supply the readily available market. ""There are people earning between US4c to US8c per a litre of fuel coming into Zimbabwe through the underhand dealings and that should explain reluctance to enforce regulations in the market."" Minister Mangoma said: ""I have not heard of it. If you have information to that effect give us registration numbers of those fuel tankers for us to take action."" He, however, confirmed that ZERA had no role to play on fuel in transit. Mr Mazambani could neither deny nor confirm the allegations saying the issue required wider stakeholder consultations. ""We will be attending to the issues you raised. There is need for wide stakeholder verification of the information you require, we will endeavour to get back to you by Monday afternoon (today),"" he said. Petro Trade chief executive officer Mr Griffin Revanewako said most of the fuel that used road transport was mainly paraffin and Jet A1. He said the quantity of such fuel was low such that it could not use the pipeline. ""You should have checked the type of the fuel in those tankers because it might have been paraffin or Jet A1,"" he said. Mr Revanewako said the use of the pipeline required huge volumes. A leading fuel supplier also acknowledged the advantages of the Feruka Pipeline. Besides being cost effective, the pipeline improved the turnaround time, ensured quality controls at Beira, Feruka and Msasa in Harare, he said. He however said the parallel market was being supplied by fuel stolen from the tankers. While confirming that information on the abuse of fuel in transit was not available, the supplier expressed confidence on Government's regulation on importation and marketing of fuel in Zimbabwe calling it ""adequate"". Zimbabwe imports around 110 million litres of fuel monthly."297,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),6/19/12,Prosecute Corruption Suspects - Donors,,ZAMBIA (96%),Newspaper,Chila Namaiko,ENGLISH,,,19-Jun-12,"LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (90%)",657 words,CORRUPTION (92%); CONSTITUTIONAL LAW (89%); TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE (78%); TREASURY DEPARTMENTS (78%); PUBLIC FINANCE (78%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (78%); BUDGETS (77%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (77%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (72%); FREEDOM OF INFORMATION (71%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (66%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (57%); INFRASTRUCTURE (50%) Zambia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Aid and Assistance,"ZAMBIA'S cooperating partners have urged Government to expedite the process of prosecuting all those charged with corruption. The donors have also welcomed Government's commitment to reforms in various sectors including the Judiciary. Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) Chairperson, Mike Hammond said in Lusaka yesterday that cooperating partners were impressed with Government's commitment in the areas of Constitution drafting process, judicial reforms and the pursuit to introduce the Freedom of Information (FoI) law. Mr Hammond, who is Department for International Development (DfID) head in Zambia, said the country had continued to be recognised in the region for sustaining peace and respecting democratic principles. He called on Government to sustain its momentum created in the fight against corruption and hasten the process of putting people charged with offences on trial before the courts. ""The Government's commitment to good governance, including the fight against corruption, are particularly high. ""It is vitally important to sustain the momentum created to date and to hasten the process of bringing those charged with offences before the courts,"" he said. He was speaking at Mulungushi International Conference Centre during the high level first joint PRBS review meeting for 2012 attended by Secretary to the Treasury, Fredson Yamba and various diplomats from countries that give support to Zambia. Speaking on behalf of the others, Mr Hammond said cooperating partners welcomed Government's plans for judicial reforms. He said the judicial reforms would be important to balance the need to resolve institutional weaknesses with safeguarding the independence of the judiciary. He cooperating partners had welcomed the current constitutional reform process and were pleased to see comprehensive consultations with the people of Zambia. ""We would urge the Government to continue promoting the constitutional reform process without delay,"" Mr Hammond said. The meeting which drew participants from various Government spending agencies was aimed at dialoguing on key aspects of underlying principles and to assess the 2011 Performance Assessment Framework (PAF). The partners also welcomed the Government's plans to progress the decentralisation process and looked forward to presentation of a roadmap for devolving functions to provincial and district levels. On the economy, Mr Hammond said Zambia had continued to show strong economic performance. He said cooperating partners would continue to offer support to enhance Zambia's capacity to critically appraise infrastructure projects in the road sector. Mr Hammond said the cooperating partners would want to hear where the Government stood on the development of a new International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme. ""Real commitment must be demonstrated by actions, concrete plans, resource allocation and ultimately by the progress made in achieving results,"" he said. He said there were many aspects of underlying principles and more information was needed before donors could reach an agreed conclusion on how the Government's commitment could be assessed. Mr Hammond, however, said the current uncertainty over the Government's intentions with respect to maize purchases in 2012 was of particular concern to budget support to cooperating partners. ""Our 2012 PRBS commitments were pledged based on the budget presented in parliament in November which included the decision to limit the budget allocation for the Food Reserve Agency (FRA) to K300 billion and the intention to return the FRA to its intended mandate,"" he said. He said a third successive supplementary budget. He, however, said the US$900 million made as commitment by the previous regime was crowding out vital spending for social services such as health and education. Mr Hammond said the cooperating partners would want to know the vision of the Patriotic Front (PF) Government for the road sector investments beyond 2012."298,The Namibian (Windhoek),6/21/12,Corruption At Local Level Worrying,,NAMIBIA (94%),Newspaper,Selma Shipanga,ENGLISH,,,21-Jun-12,,441 words,CORRUPTION (91%); PUBLIC POLICY (90%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (88%); ETHICS (79%); POLLS & SURVEYS (78%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (78%); TRENDS (78%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (77%); LEGISLATION (75%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (65%) Namibia; Corruption,"Corruption at local and regional level is not tackled with the same importance given to cases at national level. This is according to the latest paper released by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) titled 'Risking Corruption: Regional and Local Governance in Namibia'. The paper is part of the IPPR's anti-corruption series. ""Many corruption cases affecting local and regional authorities occur beneath the radar and if they do reach the national spotlight, they are often only referred to in passing with few follow-up media reports appearing,"" reads the paper. The paper, authored by IPPR's Ellison Tjirera, Malakia Haimbondi and Graham Hopwood, states that anti-corruption legislation, regulations and initiatives at local or regional level are often not developed and promoted with the same vigour as national responses to corruption. ""With little attention being paid to the activities of many local and regional authorities, inadequate regulations in place, and council staff teams sometimes short of key personnel and lacking specific skills, the scene is set for corruption to take place,"" reads the report. Corruption is reported to be a worrying factor at local and regional level, with at least 18 local authorities having featured in articles about governance problems, some multiple times for different cases over the last seven years. Trends in these cases include the manipulation of the public procurement systems to divert tenders to companies linked to officials or elected politicians. ""In several cases, officials appear to see nothing wrong with allocating tenders to their associates and even family members. Undoubtedly the area of public contracting is the most vulnerable to corruption,"" reads the paper. In late 2011, the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) published its Namibia National Urban Corruption Perception Survey Report based on a nationwide survey of 1 200 people. The most corrupt institution was perceived to be the Government Institutions Pension Fund (GIPF) with 37 per cent perception. Local authorities came in tenth place. The IPPR indicates that clearly there is a lack of ethical conduct, but also a lack of oversight, ""loopholes in laws"" and a failure to enforce the relevant laws that do exist. ""Law enforcement agencies, including the ACC should also be active in all regions so that the reporting of suspected corruption is a straightforward process,"" recommends the IPPR. In addition, the IPPR suggest that the office of the Ombudsman could also have an official presence in the regions to enable citizens to report matters that might not be corruption per se but fall under the Ombudsman's mandate."299,The Namibian (Windhoek),6/25/12,Verdict in Boois Corruption Case On July Two,,NAMIBIA (93%),Newspaper,Luqman Cloete,ENGLISH,,,26-Jun-12,,396 words,VERDICTS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (89%); ACQUITTAL (78%); WITNESSES (78%); TESTIMONY (78%); LAWYERS (75%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE Keetmanshoop Regional Court on Friday set July 2 as the day for the judgement in the trial of former Karas governor and Berseba Constituency regional councillor Dawid Boois, who is charged with 24 counts of corruption. Boois is accused of using his position as governor for gratification by allegedly pocketing a monthly housing subsidy of N$7 500 over a 24-month period between 2005 and 2007 while living in a government house. At the start of the trial, Boois pleaded not guilty to charges of corruption but admitted that he received the housing subsidy while he was living in a government house. He however claimed that the residence was not an official governor's house. When the State closed its case on Friday, defence counsel Sisa Namandje requested that his client be discharged, claiming that the State had failed to prove his guilt. ""While asking for my client's acquittal, I just want to note in passing that it's shocking how people are arrested and brought to court without any legal foundation,"" said Namandje. Namandje argued that the State had failed to prove that his client directly or indirectly had corruptly used the position of his office for gratification. Namandje added that none of the State witnesses suggested during their testimony that Boois had used his powers as governor for gratification. ""There was no allegation that the office was used. It disturbs me to note the mixed-up use of contraventions to constitute corruption,"" said Namandje. Namandje described the illegal housing subsidy as just an ""administrative hiccup"" which does not constitute corruption. ""It's a disagreement. Council knew they voluntarily paid him [Boois]. My client did not demand the payment or used his position, Namandje said."" State prosecutor, Pieter Smit contended that Boois knew long before he had moved into the government house that it was illegal to receive a housing subsidy while living in a government house. This, Smit contended, demonstrated intention on the part of Boois to commit an offence. Saying there is a wider interpretation of the phrase, ""use of office for gratification"", Smit said corruption was indeed proved against Boois because he used his high position to refuse to correct what was wrong when the illegal housing subsidy payment was brought to his attention by junior staff. ""He committed the act by refusing to correct what was wrong,"" said Smit."300,The Herald (Harare),6/26/12,Corruption Blamed On Poor Remuneration,,ZIMBABWE (93%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,26-Jun-12,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (92%)",430 words,CORRUPTION (91%); CIVIL SERVICES (90%); WAGES & SALARIES (90%); STRATEGIC PLANNING (89%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (79%); LEGAL AID (79%); BRIBERY (78%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (78%); LITIGATION (77%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (74%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; NGOs and Civil Society; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Justice and Legal Affairs Deputy Minister Obert Gutu has blamed the rampant corruption particularly in the public sector to poor remuneration. He challenged Government to urgently address the issue of civil servants' salaries to arrest the scourge. Dep Min Gutu said this while addressing an Anti-Corruption Committee strategic planning workshop in Harare last week. He said corruption in the justice sector had reached unprecedented levels and efforts to curb it through media campaigns were not bearing fruit. ""There is dire need for quick intervention to restore sanity. Let me hasten to say that this intervention must include addressing the problem of poor remuneration, especially in the public service if at all we are serious about kicking corruption to the curb. This should discourage petty stealing as well as large-scale bribery in the public sector,"" he said. Deputy Minister Gutu said the courts were not in a position to deal effectively with corruption because they are not adequately equipped. ""The judiciary has time and again stated that it is willing to address corruption but willingness alone will not solve the problem. Our courts are generally poorly equipped and trials take a long time making it possible for the police, prosecutors, magistrates and other court officials to manipulate the process,"" he said. The deputy minister said corruption was also rampant at the deeds and companies offices. ""This is exacerbated by bogus estate agents, the manufacturing of fake court orders and fake identity cards. Some shameful individuals have also abused our Legal Aid Directorate which is meant to assist the underprivileged and ensure access to justice for all,"" he said. Deputy Minister Gutu said concerted efforts by the ACC to arrest graft have not yielded much as corruption continues to spread its wings to the private and even civil society. The creation of the ACC was promoted by high levels of corruption in the judiciary sector. This prompted the Ministry to establish a committee to deal with corruption issues. The strategic plan was aimed at helping stimulate co-operative, integrated and enthusiastic approach to tackling the scourge. Deputy Minister Gutu said the absence of a strategic plan had greatly affected the work of the committee. ""For quite some time the Anti-Corruption Committee has been groping in the dark and going round in circles like a ship without a radar owing to the fact that the committee did not have a strategic plan,"" he said. The committee comprises senior officials from the Ministry of Justice and Legal Affairs' 13 departments."301,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),6/26/12,"Auditor General, Anti-Corruption Act Seal Deal to Speed Up Investigations",,ZAMBIA (93%),Newspaper,Chusa Sichone,ENGLISH,,,26-Jun-12,,1635 words,CORRUPTION (94%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (90%); AUDITS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (89%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (75%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (73%); MONEY LAUNDERING (73%) Zambia; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Corruption,"""SECTION 6 1(e) of the Anti-Corruption Act Number 3 of 2012 requires the Commission to co-ordinate with other institutions involved in the prevention and combating of corrupt practices so as to implement an integrated approach to the eradication of corruption."" Those are the words of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) Director-General Rosewin Wandi during the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between her institution and the Office of the Auditor-General (OAG) led by Anna Chifungula. Before June 14, 2012, law enforcement agencies such as ACC were not privy to the OAG's findings of financial mismanagement or irregularities in public offices. Therefore, ACC would be left in the dark about the audit findings until the OAG produces its report. In other words, investigations into corruption cases emanating from audit reports were mainly commenced after the reports were availed to the Commission. It is worth noting also that after the culprits are known through the report and subsequently appear before the Parliamentary Accounts Committee (PAC) to exculpate themselves, the prosecution process takes a long time and at times does not even occur at all. With effect from June 14, 2012, financial irregularities findings will not be kept under wraps by the OAG only to be made known to the public through its report. This follows an MoU signed between the two institutions on June 14, this year. The MoU came into effect from the date of execution by both parties and would remain in force until it is terminated by either party giving to the other three months notice by assigning reasons therefore. The Commission is mandated by the Republican Constitution to spearhead the fight against corruption in Zambia through prevention of the vice, community education, investigation and prosecution of offenders. The OAG, on the other hand, has constitutional powers to conduct audits in all institutions where the Government has interest. According to the MoU, the two parties are aware that corruption is a predicate offence to other criminal activities such as fraud and money laundering, among other vices, and the ACC and OAG are committed to dealing with corruption through audits and investigations. It further states that the two institutions are committed to greater coordination and collaboration among State organs in the prevention and combating of corruption to enhance good governance through implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Policy. The parties have agreed to collaborate and support each other in pursuing investigations relating to their mandate both through their headquarters and in their regional offices around Zambia. The parties have recognised the need for expedience and collaboration in order to facilitate investigations. ""Where appropriate, information and findings from the audits being undertaken by the Office of the Auditor-General would be shared with the Commission; where necessary, the Commission may in the course of investigations procure from the Office, officers' expertise, information and documents relevant to the conduct of an investigation as may, from time to time, be agreed by the Commission and the Office, for analysis aimed at facilitating an investigation,"" the MoU reads in part. In terms of joint operations, it adds, each party would bear its own costs. The purpose of the MoU is to provide a framework through which information and findings would be shared between the two parties so as to speedily exchange information, and avoid unnecessary delays and bottlenecks in an investigation. It also aims at calling on each other's expertise and provide a channel for information sharing between the two institutions to facilitate investigations. On issues of obligations and confidentiality, the MoU states that each party would do everything possible for the time being in their power to ensure that relevant and appropriate information is passed between them freely and without hindrance to avoid unnecessary delays in the course of an investigation or audit. All information shared, obtained and exchanged through the MoU is deemed confidential. Each party would at all times maintain the confidentiality and is expected not to disclose any information or subject matter or implementation to any other person or authority. However, the aforementioned empowers either party to go against only if it is required by the law to do so. It was previously agreed by both parties in the terms and form and in the confidence of their professional advisers. Speaking shortly before signing the MoU, Ms Wandi said the development was a timely one and that it had come at a time when efforts to combat corruption were being intensified, adding that it also complemented the strong political will the Patriotic Front (PF) Government had exhibited to stamp out the vice in the country by declaring ""war""and taking a zero-tolerance stance on graft. ""The event we are witnessing today is a great achievement in our efforts as a country to eradicate corruption which has become a major impediment to economic and social development. I am, therefore, delighted that the signing of this MoU is happening at a time when the people of Zambia need it the most. ""The Anti-Corruption Commission has taken advantage of the prevailing political will to strengthen and step up its efforts in the fight against corruption in Zambia,"" she said. Ms Wandi said the political will was being exemplified through, among other milestones, increased funding to the Commission and oversight institutions as well as the enactment of the Anti-Corruption Act Number 3 of 2012, Section 6 1(e) which promotes co-ordination. President Michael Sata recently assented to the Bill. The Commission, she added, strongly believed that the OAG was an invaluable partner in the fight against corruption because of its pivotal role in providing information from audits, whose revelations called for positive response from law enforcement agencies. ""The signing of this MoU will allow the Anti-Corruption Commission to have access to information relating to corruption arising from audits undertaken by the Office of the Auditor-General before the Auditor-General's Report is released,"" she said. Ms Wandi observed that the country had been experiencing severe looting of the hard-earned public resources by a ""few selfish"" individuals at the expense of national development, a thing she said should not be allowed to continue. Ms Chifungula said the MoU-signing signified the opening of a new chapter in Zambia's fight against the corruption scourge and echoed Ms Wandi's remarks on Government's stance against the vice. ""As you may be aware, corruption if left unchecked can erode wealth, increase poverty and cripple Government structures and systems. ""It can also lead to failure to deliver services and in its extreme, cause strife among the citizenry who may feel dissatisfied with the service delivery. ""Corruption in most cases causes the cost of doing business to be extremely expensive,"" she said. Ms Chifungula explained that the MoU sought to improve collaboration between the two institutions through timely information sharing and expertise which would in turn positively contribute to Government's efforts of stamping out corruption. ""All cases of suspected fraud and corruption, once discovered in the course of audit, will be communicated in real time to ensure their timely prosecution,"" she said. She, however, said there was need for the institutions to guard against any possible complacency in collaborations in the fight against corruption and mismanagement of public resources, but that they should instead endeavour to ensure that the MoU signing contributes to the evolution of a much stronger working relationship between them to the detriment of those that engage in such vices. Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) Commissioner Alita Mbahwe, in congratulating the two institutions, said the MoU was an important initiative as it would help DEC in combating money laundering cases. Ms Mbahwe hoped the MoU was the beginning of more such agreements with other law enforcement agencies. PAC chairperson Vincent Mwale said the committee and Parliament as a whole were delighted at the development spearheaded by the ""powerful women"" as such initiatives to promote timely and quick action against those that flout financial regulations had been long overdue. Mr Mwale said delays or no action being taken against culprits discouraged the efforts of the OAG and PAC after making recommendations and hoped the MoU would help in safeguarding the much-needed resources to develop the country. ""We need these resources to develop our country,"" he said. Zambia Police Service commissioner in charge of administration, Antoneill Mutentwa said the service would play its role to lighten the job of the two institutions as they did for the police by pledging to strengthen the Stella Libongani-led service's commitment to the fight against corruption and other related vices. ""Indeed, as police, we will do our role to make your job much, much more lighter because what you do also makes our job much, much lighter. ""So as police, we do also here cement our commitment to the fight against corruption,"" Mr Mutentwa said. The deal has been sealed and words have been spoken. It is now incumbent upon the two institutions, in collaboration with other relevant law enforcement agencies and the general public, to put the MoU into action. It should not end at that. Ms Chifungula sums up everything by saying: ""Our institutions must endeavour to ensure that this MoU's success does not end with the pomp and spledour of the signing ceremony, but that it contributes to the evolution of a much stronger working relationship between ourselves to the detrimentof those who choose the path of corruption and similar vices."""302,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),6/28/12,We Will End Corruption in Mining Sector - Yaluma,,ZAMBIA (95%); ETHIOPIA (94%); SOUTH AFRICA (92%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,EARTH (53%),28-Jun-12,"LONDON, ENGLAND (79%); LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (72%); JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA (50%)",383 words,MINES & MINING (94%); CORRUPTION (90%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (89%); PRIVATIZATION (79%); WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (79%); BUSINESS OPERATIONS (78%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%); MINE PLANNING & MANAGEMENT (78%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (73%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (67%) Zambia; Mining; Corruption,"GOVERNMENT will ensure that all transactions in the mining sector are conducted in a transparent manner so as to end corruption, Energy, Mines and Water Development Minister Christopher Yaluma has said. Mr Yaluma said the Government would ensure that dealings in the operations of the mining sector were above board. The minister was speaking during a meeting with his Ethiopian counterpart, Ato Tolessa Shagi in Lusaka yesterday, ""We are very much trying to ensure that we do the business in the most transparent way so that corruption doesn't encroach into our business operations,"" he said. He said Government was trying to maximise the proceeds from the mining firms through employing monitoring mechanisms. The Government was closely working with players in the industry to harmonise mining operations among the mining companies, the State and members of the community. Mr Yaluma said despite the country being in the mining business for a long time, it still needed more knowledge and technical know-how, especially that mining was dynamic. He said Zambia still faced challenges in the issuance of licences and that some of the hitches needed to be resolved using different approaches. He said it was imperative that the Zambian and Ethiopian governments exchanged ideas relating to the mining sector. The minister tasked his deputy, Richard Musukwa to come up with a workable roadmap highlighting how the two countries could share ideas on mining before the Ethiopian delegation leaves the country on Sunday. Mr Shagi said his delegation was in Zambia to learn how the country was implementing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The delegation also wants to acquire knowledge on the sector from the country's vast experience as the Ethiopian ministry of mines did not have as much experience as Zambia did. Zambia EITI secretariat head, Siforiano Banda said Zambia felt privileged to be used as a showcase in the EITI implementation. Zambia joined EITI in July 2008 owing to perceived lack of transparency following the privatisation of the mining sector. It became a candidate country in May 2009. The EITI was first announced at the World Summit for Sustainable Development (the Earth Summit) in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2002 and officially launched in London the following year."303,The Herald (Harare),7/12/12,"City Riddled With Corruption, Mismanagement - Councillors",,ZIMBABWE (94%),Newspaper,Michael Chideme,ENGLISH,,,12-Jul-12,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (94%)",490 words,CITIES (91%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (91%); CITY GOVERNMENT (91%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); MAYORS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); TALKS & MEETINGS (89%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (78%); CIVIL SERVICES (73%); RESIDENTIAL COOPERATIVES (71%); APPROVALS (68%); INVESTIGATIONS (65%); LABOR UNIONS (60%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Governance,"Harare City Council is riddled with corruption, mismanagement and lack of leadership, vices that have negatively affected service delivery. Briefing Local Government, Rural and Urban Development Minister Ignatius Chombo on developments in Harare yesterday, the city's special interest councillors took turns to blast Mayor Muchadeyi Masunda, town clerk Dr Tendai Mahachi and directors. ""We lack resolute and determined leadership. ""The mayor and town clerk have no capacity to push directors on the ground. The mayor and town clerk speak lofty plans but there is no action on the ground,"" Clr Thembinkosi Magwaliba said. The Harare lawyer said the ""two eloquent speakers"" have let the city down by projecting an image of the city that is divorced from the reality. He said there was clear and palpable corruption of councillors especially when it comes to awarding tenders and approval of deals. Clr Magwaliba said there was concerted effort to push donor-funded projects to the detriment of the internally funded programmes. He accused ""individuals"" within council trying to impress donors by accounting for the funds. Most housing co-operatives in Harare, he said, were fronted by councilors. Clr Lisbon Marufu said most of the co-operatives that were being given land were illegally connecting municipal water causing shortages to residents who pay for the service. There was also a complaint that only co-operatives aligned to the MDC-T were getting land. The co-operatives aligned to the MDC-T and companies that have official representation in council were also getting land at very cheap prices. Clr Magwaliba said the present council was being populist in parceling out land. ""We are parceling land like we are the last residents of Harare,"" he said. Minister Chombo agreed with the sentiments expressed by Clr Magwaliba. Clr Sasha Jogi said council was divided accusing senior officials of stripping the city of its assets. ""The camps are quietly and expeditiously getting rid of city assets. Nobody is in control of the functionaries. There is no pro-active leadership at Town House,"" he said. He asked Minister Chombo to institute an investigation into the city operations. Clr Angus Martens said the city was trying to destroy the Harare Municipal workers Union to put into office a subservient union that turns a blind eye to wrongs committed. Clr Moosa Allana complained that council surrendered the title deeds of Trafalgar Court to a local bank for over a US$5 million overdraft yet the property was worth far more than that. Mayor Muchadeyi Masunda once accused special interest councillors as non-performers. Minister Chombo promised to convene a meeting with council tomorrow (Friday) to discuss some of the issues raised. He said he would get the elected councillors to enumerate on issues affecting service delivery despite the city having grand service delivery plans. Mr Masunda and committee chairpersons are expected to attend the meeting."304,Concord Times (Freetown),7/16/12,Former ACC Boss Talks About His Experience in Sierra Leone at UN Corruption Debate,,SIERRA LEONE (95%); UNITED STATES (92%); AFRICA (92%),Newspaper,Dennis Kabatto,ENGLISH,,"NEW YORK, USA (92%)",18-Jul-12,,881 words,CORRUPTION (95%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (78%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (77%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (76%); LAWYERS (74%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (74%); LEGISLATION (69%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (69%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (50%) Sierra Leone; International Organizations and Africa; Corruption,"Many anti-corruption commissions have been ""set up to fail, however they could succeed if they were given the right mandate and the right powers. In many cases those elements were lacking,"" former Anti-Corruption Commissioner ACC boss, Mr. Abdul Tejan-Cole said during his address as a panelist at the recently concluded two-day United Nations Economic and Social Council ECOSOC 2012 high-level panel discussion held to highlight the costs of corruption on societies. The two day high-level corruption discussion from July 9 to 10 held at the UN headquarters in New York, offered two interactive dialogues under the overall theme of ""Accountability, transparency and sustainable development: turning challenges into opportunities"". The first panel was focused on ""Creating inclusive and cohesive societies: a multidisciplinary approach to combating corruption for development"" and the second on ""Shared roles and responsibilities: developing innovative partnerships for comprehensive action against corruption"". Sharing some of the lessons from his experience in Sierra Leone during the first interactive panel on Monday July 9th, Mr. Tejan-Cole, who is currently the Regional Director for Africa at the Open Society Foundation based in New York, told the panel that the most important challenge in his country's context was that ""the anti-corruption commission had a very weak legal framework and a very weak law. When the commission itself was setup in 2000, it was largely set up not as a result of the desire of the government of Sierra Leone to implement a genuine anti-corruption reform, but largely because of the pressure it was receiving from the donors and so a weak law was put in place that had only nine offenses."" He also emphasized that during his tenure as ACC head between 2008 and 2010, a new anti-corruption act was put in place in Sierra Leone which instituted several new provisions. A major change in the law includes a key provision in the new act which took away prosecutorial powers from the attorney general and minister of justice and handed it over to the anti-corruption commissioner. Also introduced in the new law were steeper legal penalties, whistleblower provisions and strengthening the hand of the ACC to be able to engage in cooperation with other states and other agencies. Mr. Tejan-Cole said prior to 2008, only about 30 corruption cases had been prosecuted in Sierra Leone and the quality of those prosecutions were left to be desired. But between 2008 and 2010, the number doubled and the quality of those prosecutions improved. More than 500 delegates, including government ministers and heads of civil society groups, international institutions and the private sector, attended the ECOSOC's high-level segment which focused on boosting productive capacity, strengthening development cooperation and creating decent and sustainable work. In his opening remarks for the discussion, Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime UNODC, Mr. Yury Fedotov, said that an estimated $40 billion is stolen from developing countries annually meaning that each country loses up to $258 million per year or $700,000 per day. He added that the high cost of the abuse is being paid by ordinary citizens who could not access basic services and urged every sector of society to see combating corruption as a shared responsibility as governments cannot win the fight alone. At the closing of the panel discussion, UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, said corruption hampers the ability of nations to prosper and grow and peace, development and human rights cannot flourish in an atmosphere of corruption. ""Last year, corruption prevented 30 per cent of all development assistance from reaching its final destination. This translates into bridges, hospitals and schools that were never built, and people living without the benefit of these services,"" Mr. Ban said. ""This is a failure of accountability and transparency. We cannot let it persist."" According to a UN News Center report, the high level panel discussion also promoted a renewed commitment for the ratification or accession to the UN Convention against Corruption by countries that have not yet done so. The Convention is the first legally binding global anti-corruption instrument which it obliges states to prevent and criminalize corruption, promote international cooperation, recover stolen assets and improve technical assistance and information exchange. In his response to a request seeking comment via Facebook about his opinion on corruption and its impact as it relates to his homeland Sierra Leone, Mr. Tejan-Cole quoted the Sierra Leone TRC report that says: ""The Commission has found that endemic corruption was a central factor that produced the dire conditions that made civil war inevitable. Sierra Leone remains in the grip of pervasive corruption, which, if not arrested, will sap the country of its life force and lay the grounds for further conflict."" He also added that ""many people who watched the movie 'Blood Diamonds' believe that the conflict in Sierra Leone was about blood diamonds. It was not as the TRC quote rightly points out."" ECOSOC will hold its operational activities and humanitarian affairs segments before concluding on 27 July."305,The Namibian (Windhoek),7/25/12,No Bail for Education Corruption Suspects,,NAMIBIA (94%),Newspaper,Werner Menges,ENGLISH,,,25-Jul-12,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (72%)",397 words,CORRUPTION (95%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (91%); MAGISTRATES (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); BAIL (90%); ARRESTS (78%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (77%); LAWYERS (73%); CATERING SERVICES (50%) Namibia; Corruption; Education; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE two men facing charges in connection with alleged corruption and fraud discovered in the Ministry of Education in June heard yesterday that they have failed with their attempt to win their release on bail. The ruling given by Magistrate Helvi Shilemba at the end of a bail hearing in the Windhoek Magistrate's Court means that Asser Shaanika Uulenga (37) and Elifas Shatipamba Amakali (32) will be remaining in custody while the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) continues with its investigation of their case. Uulenga, who is employed by the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation, and Amakali, who is a former official in the Ministry of Education, are charged with three counts under the Anti-Corruption Act and one charge of fraud at this stage. They were arrested and charged four weeks ago. The charges under the Anti-Corruption Act are counts of corruptly using an office or position for gratification, corruptly giving gratification to an agent as a reward, and the corrupt use of a false document by an agent. Magistrate Shilemba recounted in her ruling that according to an ACC investigator the initial amount of money involved in the matter at the start of the investigation was about N$300 000. As the investigation progressed, this amount has grown to about N$2,1 million, she said. It is alleged that Uulenga and Amakali had been involved in creating false invoices which were presented to the Ministry of Education for payment, and which resulted in money being paid for goods and services which had never been delivered to the ministry. Uulenga and Amakali both told the court that they are denying the charges and that they would be pleading not guilty when they go on trial. According to Uulenga, he received a payment of N$300 000 from the Ministry of Education, but this was a legitimate transaction for catering services and stationery which he had supplied to the ministry, the magistrate recounted. She turned down the two men's application to be granted bail on the grounds that, although it is unlikely that they would abscond or interfere with the investigation if they are released, it would not be in the interest of the public or the administration of justice to release them on bail. Uulenga and Amakali, who were represented by defence lawyer Tomas Nekongo, are scheduled to appear in court again on September 28. Public Prosecutor Eric Naikaku represented the State."306,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),8/15/12,Mumba Wants Corruption Tag Discarded,,ZAMBIA (94%); GHANA (79%),Newspaper,Chusa Sichone,ENGLISH,,,15-Aug-12,"LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (73%)",538 words,CORRUPTION (90%); POLITICS (77%); MUSIC COMPOSITION (72%); SONG WRITING (72%) Zambia; Corruption; Governance,"MMD leader Nevers Mumba has implored party members to ensure they remove the corruption tag associated with his party, which he said has now turned into a popular ""song"" in Zambia. And Dr Mumba has said he enjoys a wonderful relationship with former Republican President, Rupiah Banda. Speaking at the start of the party retreat in Lusaka's Chilanga area yesterday, Dr Mumba said politics was more about perception than reality. ""It is how we are perceived by most Zambians that must be addressed,"" he said. Dr Mumba said members needed to work hard to change the negative perception about the MMD, especially the corruption tag which has been associated with the party. ""It is true that some of the key players, if not most, who could have painted this image are no longer in the party, but the song continues to be sung that MMD is a corrupt party and we seem to have somebody who has composed that song and has sung it long enough and it has become a popular chorus in the country. ""So any politician who wants to attack MMD, they only have to play the record: MMD is corrupt, the song that's been coined. It is being sung everywhere. It remains our responsibility to deal with this song,"" he said. The opposition leader said the former ruling party had gone for the retreat to, among others, disown the corruption tag and mount a spirited fight against any acts of corruption both in MMD and Government. He said reform was necessary as without that, MMD would not survive in the current political scenario. Dr Mumba said the survival of the party would be dependent on effectively changing the inherent challenge of ""tokenism and nchekelako"" (handouts). And Dr Mumba said enemies of the party had been using the media to create an impression that he was not getting along with former president Banda. ""I want to clear the air. President Banda and I are enjoying a wonderful relationship. There's no reason for me to ever doubt his commitment to this party and his commitment to the support that he has continued to give me as the new president. ""He calls me, I call him. Whenever I have a challenge, I talk to him. And the issue of saying that President Banda has stopped funding the party, I have no clue (of) what they are talking about. Like I said in that newspaper, President Banda continues to stand with us in any way and if he has any resources he will give to the party,"" he said. In another development, Dr Mumba said it was regrettable that Government decided to send PF Secretary-General, Wynter Kabimba to attend the burial of Ghanaian President John Atta Mills. He said the Government should have sent Vice-President Guy Scott or Home Affairs Minister, Edgar Lungu who also attended the procession together with Gender and Development Minister, Inonge Wina. He also asked Government to explain who funded Mr Kabimba's trip, whether it was the State or the party. But Chief Government spokesperson Kennedy Sakeni condemned Dr Mumba for politicking on a funeral of a head of state. Mr Sakeni said on ZNBC main news monitored in Lusaka yesterday that the MMD leader should not bother the nation with trivial issues because there was nothing wrong for President Michael Sata to send Mr Kabimba and two Cabinet ministers to represent him."307,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),8/22/12,'Treat Corruption Suspects Equally',,ZAMBIA (79%),Newspaper,Catherine Nyirenda,ENGLISH,,,23-Aug-12,"LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (66%)",310 words,CORRUPTION (94%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (90%); POLITICS (78%); INTERVIEWS (77%) Zambia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE MMD in Western Province has said the party leadership should treat all officials suspected of corruption equally and ensure that all national executive committee (NEC) members facing court cases give up their positions until they are cleared. MMD Provincial Youth chairperson Musangu Njamba, said in an interview yesterday that members in Western Province were disappointed that the NEC was not being fair in handling issues to do with corruption in its quest to rid the party of a corruption tag. He said it was not fair for some NEC members who met last week at a retreat to brand former chairperson for Labour Austin Liato with a corruption tag yet ""many more leaders in the party were facing corruption charges."" Mr Njamba said the resignation of Mr Liato would lead to the extinction of the party in the province. MMD President, Nevers Mumba, announced at the close of the retreat that the party would have nothing to do with members who had been convicted of corruption and other cases. Mr Liato, is, however, the only member of the party who has been convicted of corruption while several other members were still facing corruption-related cases. ""Mr Liato has appealed against his judgement and his case is still in court just like any other cases involving NEC members. In this case let Dora Siliya, Gabriel Namulambe and Maxwell Mwale also step aside from their positions until they are cleared of these charges,"" he said. But MMD Lusaka Province Youth chairperson, Watson Mtonga said Mr Liato's resignation was in the best interest of the party. He said Dr Mumba's move to sideline people who were convicted of corruption would bring sanity in the party. ""Lusaka Province youths would like to thank Dr Mumba for making us realise some of the wrong things that were happening in the party as we the cadres were not aware of all these wrong things,"" he said."308,The Herald (Harare),9/4/12,Chiredzi Town Council Faces Corruption Probe,,ZIMBABWE (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,4-Sep-12,,394 words,CITY GOVERNMENT (94%); CITIES (93%); CORRUPTION (93%); INVESTIGATIONS (91%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (91%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CITY LIFE (89%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"GOVERNMENT has instituted investigations into MDC-T-dominated Chiredzi town council following allegations of corruption among councillors and senior officials. They are accused of parcelling to themselves residential stands, which they would dispose of at astronomical prices to desperate home seekers. The underhand dealings reportedly resulted in the cash-strapped council losing tens of thousands of dollars in revenue. This prompted Local Government, Rural and Urban Development Minister Ignatius Chombo to set up a team to probe the MDC-T run council. Masvingo provincial administrator Mr Felix Chikovo yesterday confirmed the investigation. ""We had received complaints of widespread corrupt activities by the councillors and senior council officials. Allegations against the councillors are centred on disposal of residential stands while some senior officials are alleged to have abused council funds."" Once investigations are complete, the probe team will hand over a report on their findings to Minister Chombo for determination. Mr Chikovo said they recommended the invesitigation into the operations of Chiredzi town council to the minister following reports of incessant corruption at the council. Chiredzi has eight wards, six of which are represented by MDC-T councillors while one is represented by a Zanu-PF councillor with the other ward vacant. It is alleged that Chiredzi town councillors allegedly parcelled among themselves serviced residential stands in the Makondo area under Tshovani township extension. The councillors would allegedly buy several stands from council for about US$500 per high-density stand and then resell them for over US$2500 each. It is also alleged that the same councillors also abused their positions selling among themselves medium density and low density stands for US$1 500 and US$2 000 respectively. They would in turn dispose of the stands for about US$4 000 and US$6 000 respectively. Most residents felt betrayed by the council and petitioned government over the alleged corruption resulting in the investigation. Most MDC-T run urban councils have been rocked by corruption allegations to the detriment of service delivery. The party recently fired 12 councillors countrywide after they were fingered in corruption. Service delivery in most urban centres run by MDC-T councillors has plummeted courting the ire of ratepayers."309,Concord Times (Freetown),9/5/12,ACC Supports Media Against Corruption Workshop,,SIERRA LEONE (72%),Newspaper,Ibrahim Tarawallie,ENGLISH,,,5-Sep-12,,402 words,CORRUPTION (97%); JOURNALISM (91%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); NEWS REPORTING (90%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (78%); ETHICS (78%); WRITERS (76%); STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS (73%); HOTELS & MOTELS (57%) Sierra Leone; Corruption; Press and Media,"With support from the Anti Corruption Commission ACC, the Media Alliance Against Corruption MAAC has trained 14 of its members across the country on reporting and investigating corruption related issues. The three-day training of trainers' capacity building workshop held at the J & M Motel in Bo, south of the country last week, looked in-depth into the 2008 Anti Corruption Act, the role of investigative journalism in corruption and good governance and journalistic ethics and legal issues in investigative journalism, among others. During the opening session, MAAC's outgoing National Coordinator, Melvin Rogers, thanked the ACC for providing the funds for the training and assured of the media alliance's support in the fight against corruption in the country. Rogers noted that the fight against corruption is a national one hence it should be the concern of everyone and not just the ACC. ""We as journalists should see ourselves as part of this fight. It is our desire to help the ACC win the fight and we want to assure the commission that we will work assiduously towards it. The media will play a great role in the success of the ACC,"" he said. The training, Rogers stated, will help greatly in building the capacity of MAAC members to be able to carry out thorough investigations and report accurately on corruption issues without bias. He urged participants to put what they have learnt during the three-day training into practice as they return to their respective newsrooms and to pass the knowledge and skills gained to those who were not fortunate to be at the workshop. ACC Head of Public Education and External Outreach, Madam Koloneh Sankoh, said it is a lay down fact that the media is the commission's strategic partner in the fight against corruption. She urged participants to start using integrity in their newspaper and radio reporting and should also keep in mind the limit and standards in their reportage. Madam Sankoh also entreated participants to be objective, open, transparent and stay neutral when reporting corruption-related activities and expressed optimism that MAAC will continue the good work it has been doing since its formation last year. During the technical sessions, presentations were made by the Head of the Mass Communications Department at Fourah Bay College, Isaac Massaquoi and Tanu Jalloh on what participants needed to know in investigating and reporting on corruption."310,The Namibian (Windhoek),9/7/12,Accountant Denies Corruption Charges,,NAMIBIA (93%),Newspaper,Werner Menges,ENGLISH,,,7-Sep-12,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (73%)",694 words,CORRUPTION (90%); TESTIMONY (90%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (88%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (78%); WAGES & SALARIES (76%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (74%); CAR RENTAL AGENCIES (70%); ARRESTS (69%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"""I followed instructions."" This was the explanation of National Assembly Chief Accountant Abraham John George when he testified in his own defence in the High Court in Windhoek yesterday. George told Judge Marlene Tommasi he was only following instructions from former National Assembly Secretary Nama Goabab when he instructed another parliamentary staff member to make arrangements for the rental of a car for Goabab's use in early 2007. He was also only following instructions from Goabab when he, later that same year, used public funds from the National Assembly to settle another car rental account of Goabab, George testified. Both George and Goabab insisted this week that they did not commit any crimes when a National Assembly purchase order was used to hire a car for Goabab's use on March 1 2007, and when a government cheque was used to pay an account of N$18 497,20 for the rental of a second car for Goabab's use on April 25 2007. Goabab testified on Tuesday and Wednesday that it was his intention all along to pay the car rental costs out of his own pocket. He also told the court that in his view the section of the Anti-Corruption Act under which he and George are charged did not apply to him in his capacity as Secretary of the National Assembly. Goabab and George are accused of having illegally rented two vehicles at Government's cost for Goabab's private use during March and April 2007. The first rental was at a cost of N$5 055, which was a special rate for Government as a client of the car rental company. If Goabab had hired the car in his private capacity, the rental cost would have been N$6 780, the prosecution is claiming. Only the account of N$18 497,20 was actually paid by the National Assembly, on April 25 2007. Goabab paid that money back to the National Assembly on June 12 2007 - four days after he and George had been arrested by the Anti-Corruption Commission. They are charged with two counts of corruption - specifically, corruptly using an office or position for gratification - and alternative counts of fraud or theft. Goabab alone is also charged with a third count of the corrupt use of an office or position for gratification, alternatively using a motor vehicle without the owner's consent, in connection with allegations that he had unlawfully used a Government vehicle on May 25 2007 while he was receiving a motor vehicle allowance as part of his salary. The two men pleaded not guilty to all charges at the start of their trial in late March 2010. Goabab claimed on Wednesday that, as National Assembly Secretary, he was not a public officer as defined by the Anti-Corruption Act. He argued that the National Assembly is ""an organ of state"", and not a ""public body"", as defined by the Act. The end result of this view is that in his opinion the Anti-Corruption Act's section 43, under which he and George are charged with corruptly using their office or position as public officers to obtain gratification, did not apply to him. The Act's definition of ""public officer"" is a wide one, and includes staff members of the public service, members of Parliament, members of the judiciary, and ""any person receiving any remuneration from public funds"". George testified yesterday that Goabab undertook to pay for the rental of the two vehicles himself. He said with the first rental he told Goabab that, since he received a vehicle allowance as part of his salary package, he was not entitled to have a vehicle hired for his use at Government's cost. When he discussed the issue with a more senior colleague, though, they agreed that since Goabab was the National Assembly's accounting officer he had the discretion to decide that the car should be hired on Government's account, he said. George said he only found out about the second rental when Goabab approached him to have the account settled. Goabab's explanation was that he had problems with his credit card, and that he would pay the money back to Government as soon as those problems had been sorted out, George said. Goabab later asked him to deduct the amount paid for the second rental from his salary, George said. The court is due to hear arguments in the matter today."311,The New Times (Kigali),9/9/12,Rwanda's Anti-Corruption Journey,,"RWANDA (94%); KENYA (93%); EASTERN AFRICA (93%); BURUNDI (92%); UGANDA (92%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (92%); AFRICA (92%); MAURITIUS (79%); CAPE VERDE (79%); BOTSWANA (79%)",Newspaper,Frank Kanyesigye,ENGLISH,,,9-Sep-12,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (92%); KIGALI, RWANDA (79%)",739 words,CORRUPTION (96%); BRIBERY (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (89%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (89%); AGREEMENTS (65%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (64%); CONTRACT AWARDS (60%) Rwanda; Corruption,"Rwanda continues to maintain a lead in the war against corruption in the region, according to several reports released by Transparency International for the last four years. The report released last week by the global corruption watchdog showed Rwanda's consistent track record in the fight against corruption among the five countries in the EAC region. The East African Bribery Index 2012 launched in Kampala last week, ranks Burundi the second least corrupt, Kenya third, while Tanzania and Uganda took the fourth and fifth positions respectively. However, this might not be a surprise to Rwanda due to standing tough measures in the country that have ensured zero tolerance to corruption. Rwanda has a bribery aggregate index of 2.5 percent Burundi; the worst ranked country last year recorded a significantly lower index of 18.8 percent, Kenya and Tanzania were 29.5 percent and 39.1 percent respectively while Uganda registered the highest bribery levels in the region with a percentage value of 40.7 percent. Yet last year in December 2011, Transparency International also found Rwanda to be the fourth least corrupt country in Africa and 47th in the world on the 2011 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). The country scored 70.8 percent, behind Mauritius with 73.2 percent, Cape Verde with 74.6 percent and Botswana which was the least corrupt African country with a score of 79.9 percent. The index ranks countries and territories from 0 (highly corrupt) to 10 (very clean) based on perceived levels of public sector corruption. The 2011 CPI gave Rwanda a score of 5.1 points, ahead of countries such as South Africa and beating its East African neighbors by a large margin. Rwanda was ranked 66th in 2010 with a score of 4.0. The 5.1 score meant that Rwanda is considered one of the countries clean of corruption (above the 5.0 mark). Speaking to The Sunday Times this week, Marie Immaculee Ingabire, and Chairperson of Transparency Rwanda, said this year the country improved the scores. ""Rwanda has maintained the lead against corruption because of the country's political will and commitment compared to other countries in the region or Africa,"" she said. Ingabire noted that, her institution has signed integrity pacts with the Ministry of Local Government to rein in mismanagement of public funds in local governments. The pacts were penned few months ago in Kigali with four pilot districts in Musanze, Huye, Kayonza and Rubavu and the initiative aims at curtailing graft in awarding tenders. Integrity pacts are agreements signed between the government or a district and all public sector bidders. The pacts engage all parties to abstain from corruption, disclose information and be transparent. Its implementation is monitored by an independent third party. Ingabire emphasised that strong sensitisation campaigns were needed to do away with mindset regarding corruption. Last year's report on corruption by TR showed the likelihood of encountering bribe demand occurrences was at 1.19 percent the prevalence of bribery at 0.8 percent and the average size of bribery was Rwf 19,844. TR regularly, on an annual basis, carries out the Rwanda Bribery Index to determine the extent of corruption in the country. On several occasions, the findings of Transparency International Rwanda show that the country has taken remarkable steps in the fight against graft-related cases. ""If our government continues to maintain strong political will in the war against corruption and zero tolerance to corruption, we hope by 2015 to be the least corrupt country in Africa and perhaps among the ten least corrupt countries in the world,"" said Ingabire. Most of the bribes paid are in small amounts of between Rwf 1,000 to 5,000 further reinforcing the position that the poorer members of society are the ones practicing it. ""Our office has been in existence for 12 years and we have maintained a clear line of advisory services to institutions by providing reports in transparent manner for the public interests,"" said Obadiah Biraro, Auditor General. He stated that his institution was one of the offices that are at the forefront in fighting against graft in the country. ""We enforce other agencies to be transparent and accountable. That is why Rwanda has maintained a good record of being the least corrupt country in the region,"" he added, but added that the country's improvement on Transparency International's CPI should not be a cause for complacency."312,The Namibian (Windhoek),9/10/12,Final Arguments in Corruption Trial,,NAMIBIA (93%),Newspaper,Werner Menges,ENGLISH,,,10-Sep-12,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (73%)",586 words,CORRUPTION (92%); VERDICTS (90%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (90%); TESTIMONY (89%); LAWYERS (78%); LEGISLATION (78%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (77%); ARRESTS (73%); WAGES & SALARIES (64%) Namibia; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Corruption,"FORMER National Assembly Secretary Nama Goabab and parliamentary accountant Abraham John George should both be found guilty of charges under the Anti-Corruption Act, the prosecution argued in their trial in the High Court in Windhoek on Friday. Danie Small, the Chief Prosecutor in the Office of the Prosecutor-General, asked Judge Marlene Tommasi to convict Goabab on three counts of the corrupt use of an office or position for gratification, and to find George guilty on two of those charges, at the end of his arguments on the verdict that the judge will have to deliver in the two men's trial. Defence lawyers Lucius Murorua, representing Goabab, and Zagrys Grobler, representing George, are scheduled to present their arguments to the court today. In written arguments already filed with the court the two lawyers have indicated that they would be asking Judge Tommasi to find the two accused men not guilty. Goabab (55) and George (51) are jointly charged with two main counts of corruptly using an office or position for gratification, which is an offence under the Anti-Corruption Act of 2003. These charges are based on allegations that they had rented two cars at Government's cost for Goabab's private use during March and April 2007. The total cost of the vehicle rentals is alleged to have been N$23 552,20, of which N$18 497,20 was actually paid by the National Assembly. Goabab paid this amount back to the National Assembly four days after he and George had been arrested by the Anti-Corruption Commission in June 2007. Goabab alone is also charged with a third count in connection with allegations that he had unlawfully used a Government car on May 25 2007 while he was receiving a motor vehicle allowance as part of his salary. Goabab and George pleaded not guilty to all charges at the start of their trial in March 2010. Goabab told the court last week that the arrangement all along was that he would pay the money which had been spent on the rentals back to Government. He also claimed that he had a discretion to decide to use a Government vehicle for work-related purposes while his private car was not available. George testified in his own defence that he was only following instructions from Goabab when he helped to arrange the two rentals and the use of National Assembly funds to pay for the second of those. The first rental was never paid, the court has heard. Small told Judge Tommasi on Friday that he was accepting that it had been Goabab's declared intention from the beginning that he would repay the National Assembly for the two rentals. However, Small stressed, what had taken place was the use of public funds for private purposes. The section of the Anti-Corruption Act under which the two men are charged, reads: ""A public officer commits an offence who, directly or indirectly, corruptly uses his or her office or position in a public body to obtain any gratification, whether for the benefit of himself or herself or any other person."" Goabab and George, who is still employed as Chief Accountant with the National Assembly, were both public officers, Small argued. Goabab's claim in his testimony last week that he was not a public servant when he was the Secretary of the National Assembly was an ""absurd notion"", Small commented. He argued that Goabab had obtained gratification when public funds were used to pay for rental cars for his private use, even if it was his intention to later repay Government. George had assisted Goabab to obtain that gratification, Small also argued."313,The Namibian (Windhoek),9/14/12,Ex-NBC Staffers Admit TV Licence Corruption,,NAMIBIA (94%),Newspaper,Werner Menges,ENGLISH,,,14-Sep-12,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (73%)",422 words,CORRUPTION (92%); BROADCASTING REGULATION (92%); BROADCASTING INDUSTRY (92%); LICENSES & PERMITS (90%); TELEVISION INDUSTRY (90%); RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY (90%); LARCENY & THEFT (90%); GUILTY PLEAS (90%); MAGISTRATES (89%); REGULATORY COMPLIANCE (89%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (89%); ADMISSIONS & CONFESSIONS (78%); PROPERTY CRIMES (78%); SENTENCING (78%); EVIDENCE (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); FINES & PENALTIES (77%); LAWYERS (75%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"TWO former employees of the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation yesterday admitted that they were guilty of corruption and other crimes in connection with the selling of stolen NBC television licences five years ago. James Tjilondelo, who was employed at the NBC as a senior compliance officer, and Timotheus Sheepo, who was a compliance officer with the national broadcaster, are set to be sentenced by Magistrate Dinnah Usiku in the Windhoek Regional Court on Wednesday next week. Each of them has pleaded guilty to two charges. Tjilondelo (29) admitted guilt to a charge of theft and a count of the corrupt use of an office or position to obtain gratification. Sheepo (43) pleaded guilty to charges of receiving stolen property, and the corrupt use of an office or position to obtain gratification. The crimes which the men admitted cost the NBC close to N$110 000. Tjilondelo admitted that he stole ten television licence books from the NBC in August 2007. He later on started to sell TV licences from those books, and pocketed the money which unsuspecting television owners paid him for the licences. He obtained a total of N$69 042 in the process, he admitted. Five of the licence books which Tjilondelo had stolen were later given to Sheepo, the court was told. Sheepo admitted that he received the stolen licence books in August 2007, and that he then also started to sell TV licences and to keep the money which he received for the licences. He received N$40 762 from the sale of the stolen licences, he admitted. Tjilondelo and Sheepo were later charged after the Anti-Corruption Commission had carried out an investigation into the licence scam. Both men are currently unemployed, their defence lawyer, Gloria Situmbeko, told the magistrate. She said they were both aware of the seriousness of the offences they had committed, and that they were sincerely sorry about what they had done. Each of them is able to pay a fine of N$2 000 on each of the two counts they admitted, Situmbeko said. Addressing the court on the sentences to be imposed on the two men, Public Prosecutor Carol-Ann Esterhuizen argued that Tjilondelo and Sheepo pleaded guilty because of the overwhelming evidence they were facing. She argued that they had abused the trust which was placed in them by the NBC by selling the licences for their own benefit. The court should make it clear that people entrusted with responsibilities by their employers should not abuse their position in any way, Esterhuizen argued. The two men remain free while awaiting their sentencing."314,The Namibian (Windhoek),9/14/12,Jacobs Denies Corruption Charges,,GERMANY (93%); NAMIBIA (93%); CENTRAL EUROPE (72%),Newspaper,Luqman Cloete,ENGLISH,,,14-Sep-12,,493 words,CORRUPTION (92%); TESTIMONY (90%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%); GARDENING (89%); APPROVALS (89%); EXECUTIVES (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (77%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (73%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (73%); CATERING SERVICES (55%); WEATHER (50%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE former chief regional officer of the Karas Regional Council, Salmaan Jacobs, pleaded not guilty to five counts of corruption when his trial started in the Keetmanshoop Regional Court on Monday. Two of the corruption counts originate from subsistence and travel allowance claims. Jacobs allegedly defrauded the Karas Regional Council of close to N$32 000 by claiming N$49 020 from the council for attending a month-long, all-expenses-paid workshop in Germany. Two other counts are based on a catering contract which Jacobs awarded as the council's tender board chairman to Sadadi Enterprise CC, a company he allegedly had an interest in, in October and November 2006. On the fifth count Jacobs is accused of using his position to obtain gratification by allegedly allocating N$30 000 to Sadadi Enterprise on the pretext that it was meant for a community gardening project at Berseba. During Wednesday's court hearing, former Karas governor Dawid Boois, now regional councillor for the Berseba Constituency, testified that he had directed Jacobs to consider the gardening project funding request, which was written on a letterhead of Sadadi Enterprises CC. According to Boois, the request was submitted by Berseba resident Marius Jacobs, who is a nephew of the accused. Boois said although he had directed Jacobs to consider funding the project, he later learnt that N$30 000 was disbursed for the project without council approval. Boois also told the court that he learnt through media reports that Jacobs had an interest in Sadadi Enterprise CC. Boois added that he had expected Jacobs to table the funding request for approval by the Regional Council, but this did not happen. Asked by State prosecutor Veiko Alexander whether the project had materialised, Boois remarked: ""No, there was only a solar panel and water reservoir on the land allocated for the establishment of the gardening project"". Furthermore, Boois testified that council had approved Jacobs's trip to Germany after it had been told that it was an all-expenses-paid trip. However, according to Boois, Jacobs afterwards submitted an incidental expenses request for appropriate clothing due to the weather in that country, and for after hours travelling in Germany. At yesterday's hearing, Marius Jacobs, in whose name the financial support was requested from council, denied that he had signed the funding request. He also told the court that he had not given powers to any person to sign documents on his behalf. Jacobs testified that he also came to know about the funding letter after the council had disbursed money for the project. According to he younger Jacobs, he was given the funding request letter by the accused after he had asked when the gardening project material was delivered at Berseba. Jacobs claimed that he had not seen a cent of the N$30 000 council donation, but added that Salmaan Jacobs had bought the gardening project material including wire, a water reservoir and a solar panel."315,The Namibian (Windhoek),9/17/12,Jacobs Corruption Trial Postponed to Next Year,,NAMIBIA (93%); GERMANY (92%); CENTRAL EUROPE (56%),Newspaper,Luqman Cloete,ENGLISH,,,17-Sep-12,,374 words,CORRUPTION (93%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (91%); TESTIMONY (89%); BOTTLED WATER MFG (85%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (76%); LAWYERS (75%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (73%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (73%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (73%); GARDENING (69%); CATERING SERVICES (52%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE corruption trial of former Karas chief regional officer Salmaan Jacobs in the Keetmanshoop Regional Court was postponed on Friday until March next year. At the start of his trial last Monday, Jacobs pleaded not guilty to five counts of corruption. Two of the corruption counts originate from subsistence and travel (S&T) allowances claims. Jacobs allegedly corruptly used his position for own gratification with the intent to defraud the council of N$18 228 on August 10 2006, when he claimed S&T allowances for attending a month-long, all-expenses-paid workshop in Germany at Rate 2 instead of the lower Rate 3 as provided by Public Service Staff Rule D 111. On the same day, Jacobs again claimed an additional N$25 592 for subsistence and travel expenses although he was allegedly not entitled as he had been paid N$18 228 more than what he was supposed to be paid for the trip to Germany. Two other counts are based on catering contracts worth N$26 400, which Jacobs, as the council's tender board chairman, awarded to Sadadi Enterprises CC, a company he and his wife Annamarie Jacobs allegedly had an interest in, in October and November 2006. On the fifth count Jacobs is accused of corruptly using his position for own gratification by allegedly allocating N$30 000 Sadadi Enterprises CC in 2006 on the pretext that it was meant for a community gardening project at Berseba. At Friday's court hearing, Berseba village secretary Thomas Willem Dreyer testified that no application for land to establish a community gardening project had been received by the council in 2005 or 2006. According to Dreyer, the village council had only received an application letter signed by Jacobs as Sadadi Enterprises CC coordinator to use a spring at Berseba for a mineral-water bottling project. When grilled by defence counsel Willem Visser that letters he wrote to Jacobs regarding the application referred to ""projects,"" meaning that there was more than one project, Dreyer insisted that the council had only discussed Jacobs's application for the water bottling project. ""Yes, we mentioned projects. It was a language error,"" said Dreyer. Berseba village councillor Sabina Esterhuizen also testified that only the water bottling project had been discussed."316,The Namibian (Windhoek),9/26/12,ACC Holds Corruption Workshop for Church Leaders,,NAMIBIA (93%),Newspaper,Rukee Kaakunga,ENGLISH,,,26-Sep-12,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (90%)",242 words,RELIGION (99%); CLERGY & RELIGIOUS (93%); CORRUPTION (91%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (71%) Namibia; Corruption; Religion,"THE Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) held a two-day training workshop on corruption for church leaders in Windhoek last week. The workshop focused on helping church leaders get an in-depth understanding of corruption, the legal framework on corruption, as well as the manifestation of corruption in the church. Church leaders from different denominations took part in the workshop which was seen as an effort by state institutions, especially the ACC, to reach out to the church in the fight against corruption. Margreth Hausiku, facilitator of the workshop, said that one of the objectives of the workshop is to seek authority from the church in dealing with corruption. ""We want to form a stronger body to influence decision-making,"" she said. She said the church alliance committee in conjunction with the ACC was formed as a body through which the church could have a united stance on corruption, and is open to all denominations to join. She especially invited the charismatic churches to join as they have a small representation in the committee. A similar workshop was held in the north earlier. Ombudsman John Walters said churches and church leaders are not immune to corruption. He called on a collective and coordinated approach to combating corruption. Parliament, the Ombudsman, ACC, the Auditor General, the judiciary, police and civil society should develop and strengthen their relationships in order to effectively combat corruption, said Walters."317,The Herald (Harare),10/2/12,Anti-Corruption Experts Visit Zim,,ZIMBABWE (97%); AUSTRIA (91%); MALAWI (79%); MADAGASCAR (79%); AFRICA (79%); CENTRAL EUROPE (70%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,2-Oct-12,"VIENNA, AUSTRIA (91%)",181 words,CORRUPTION (94%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (90%); CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES CRIME (88%); TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (86%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; International Organizations and Africa,"Anti-corruption experts from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime recently visited Zimbabwe to review the country's anti-graft laws and their applications.

ACC spokesperson, Timothy Moono said at a Press briefing in Lusaka yesterday that the launch of the inquiries followed complaints received on the alleged conduct of the two Cabinet ministers. ""Yes we are on that case, our officers have received official complaints of alleged corruption involving the two ministers and the nation will be kept informed about the outcome of the investigations,"" Mr Moono said. Mr Kabimba, who is Patriotic Front (PF) Secretary-General, is alleged to have influenced the procurement tender process so that Trafigura would be awarded the tender to supply Zambia with petrol and diesel for one year. Trafigura was awarded the supply deal at a cost of US$500 million for the one year period. On the other hand, Mr Mwamba is accused of influencing ZESCO to award his company and others where he had interests, a one-year contract for the supply and delivery of wooden poles. ZESCO intends to award a tender for the supply and delivery of nine, 10 and 12 metre-wooden poles on a year-running-contract basis to several bidders, among them Arizona Marketing and Distribution, which belongs to Mr Mwamba and two of his family members. Arizona Marketing and Distribution's bid price on the ZESCO poles contract was about K36.7 billion. The company, according to the Patents and Companies Registration Agency (PACRA), was owned by Mr Mwamba, of Plot 10 Roan Road in Lusaka's Kabulonga area. Preliminary notification of the contract award for the tender, whose bids were closed and opened on June 8, 2012, indicated that the preliminary award had been issued pursuant to Part VI, Section 53 (1) and (2) of the Zambia Public Procurement Act No. 12 of 2008. When contacted separately, the two ministers have, however, welcomed the investigations saying they had nothing to fear or hide. Mr Kabimba said he had confidence in the ACC and that it would get to the bottom of the matter and the truth would surface."" I welcome the investigations. I have confidence in the ACC and I am sure the truth will come out,"" Mr Kabimba said.

Proving it calls for protection of whistleblowers, cooperation and appropriate legal provisions. According to Transparency International, Rwanda has maintained its record in fighting corruption. The law protecting witnesses and whistleblowers are already in place. These pieces of legislation underscore the government's resolve to fight graft. According to the office of the Ombudsman, the whole institution is still understaffed, with only ten staff, it is a challenge to fight graft efficiently. Even when the appropriate laws are in place, there is still need for human and financial resources to implement them. Availing sufficient staff and funds to allow it to properly function up to lower local government levels, where corruption is often reported is necessary. The past prosecution of corruption suspects is a clear sign that the government is serious about combating the vice in our society. Let us all support the Ombudsman in this campaign. Also, the fight against corruption should be extended, to include the private sector. Those found guilty, should face financial penalties that can help the office of the Ombudsman meet its operational costs as it endeavors to be more efficient."321,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),10/20/12,Effects of Corruption On Cost of Production in Agriculture [column],,ZAMBIA (94%); UNITED STATES (94%); AFRICA (94%); ASIA (92%); EUROPE (92%),Newspaper,Felix Tembo,ENGLISH,,,20-Oct-12,,1033 words,CORRUPTION (90%); AGRICULTURE (88%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (79%); BRIBERY (74%); WEALTHY PEOPLE (74%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (73%); CORN FARMING (73%); JOB CREATION (72%); ECONOMIC NEWS (67%); CASE STUDIES (66%) Zambia; Agribusiness; Corruption,"Corruption is a vice that is found everywhere; USA, Europe, Australia, Asia and Africa. However, it is more pronounced in Africa because of the lack of political will to fight it. In other countries like America and Britain, immediately a public officer is suspected of being involved in corruption of any kind, he/she will step down to allow the law takes its course because if they persist to hold on to their offices, they will be suspended. In Zambia, corruption started a long time ago but it became more pronounced after 1991 because it was strongly embraced by our leaders then. Very few Zambians that claim to be very rich got their riches through genuine channels; a lot of us who have mansions, companies and swim in unlimited riches had links with some controlling officers in government or people with vantage positions. Well, as my passion is in agriculture because I am a son of poor peasant farmers; I want to highlight what corruption does in regards to the cost of production and how it inversely affects job creation and ultimately economic development. The case study ofcourse is Zambia. Transparent International defines corruption as the misuse of entrusted power for private gain. It is the dishonest or fraudulent conduct by those in power, typically involving bribery. A lot of us think corruption only takes place in public offices, no! Even in private sector this ugly animal thrives. (Take for instance; I own an input supply company and the government have floated a tender to supply a particular product. I happen to know the key person who can influence the results for offer of that tender and I go in the 'night' and negotiates with that person that if he/she influences the results, he will have a cut in the spoils). It is no longer a secret that there could have been corruption in the supply of oil tenders as revealed by the various commissions of inquiries instituted by the president. The effect that corruption had on agriculture is that it made the cost of inputs higher. If corruption is involved in the supply of oil products, it increases the cost of producing a kg of maize and that cost is transferred to the consumer along the value chain. What it means is that if one wanted to grow two hectares of maize, he/she will be forced to reduce it to one because she/he cannot afford the costs involved. This means that the number of people that would have been employed had two hectares been planted would reduce. This will also have a bearing on the efficiency of producing that kg of maize. If I could have produced it at K500 without corruption being involved, I would now produce it at K800 and this will go on up to the point the maize meal is consumed. I have decided to write about this topic because I was taken aback when the minister of agriculture announced the FISP tender results. I was surprised to learn that through the revision of the tendering procedure, billions of kwacha was saved. The question l am still asking today is how can the fertiliser be cheaper this year than last year when the prices of oil which is a major component in transportation of this fertiliser has been rising every after three months? Have we suddenly become so efficient in our operations that overnight we are able to cut costs? I still feel the tendering for FISP should be subjected to further scrutiny because there are still too many grey areas. It will be very unfortunate if any official whether at political, policy or private are still involving themselves in the vice because they will not only be fixed by the next regime that will come, but God will punish them eternally as they are making the life of us that do not have links to suffer perpetually. Yes, we are suffering because jobs cannot be created as would have been due to the high cost of production and many that cannot cope are dying of hunger at the backdrop of the bumper harvests. Let me salute His Excellency the President Michael Sata for allowing the ACC to investigate his ministers in regards to the allegations by some quarters of society that they were allegedly involved or influenced the results for the supply of oil and some works at Zesco. The people that have been accused are very close to the president and it is really a big test to the genuineness of the fight. My advice to the president is that he should take a leaf from the good policies that Dr kenneth Kaunda had put in place where he did not allow his ministers to be involved in 'public business'. Let those that are good at doing business not join public offices. Two months ago, I received a call from one of the poultry farmers who was asking me as to why the cost of feed is too expensive in Zambia although we are self-sufficient in maize and soyabean production which are the major raw materials. The answer to that question is partly answered in this article; there are a lot of unnecessary costs that are associated with the cost of production in this country and this has been complemented by the revised minimum wage. China has managed to develop at the rate at which it is because the cost of production in that country has been low for a very long time until recently. You will appreciate my point that even if china is a major producer of groundnuts and other agricultural commodities, it imports a lot of them because they believe in value addition. They prefer exporting finished goods as compared to commodities. USA, which is one of the most developed nations is being surpassed in terms of economic development due to the low cost of doing business in China. We also need to check all the grey areas in terms of agricultural production to revive and stimulate agricultural production and encourage value addition. We don't need rocket scientists to conclude that there could have been underhand methods in the supply of inputs for FISP and if indeed they were there, there is need to clean them up.

She said this when she opened a four-day fraud and corruption conference in Swakopmund. The conference is taking place under the theme 'Clean Business, Clean Government: Cracking Down Fraud, Corruption and Financial Crime'. Among the participants are directors of internal audit; senior government officials; representatives from the office of the Prosecutor General as well as constituency, regional and local authority councillors. Kuugongelwa-Amadhila said the conference gives those present an opportunity to share experiences. ""Tax fraud, for example, has an immediate effect of depriving Government of the much-needed resources to address pervasive poverty and unemployment which plague our societies, or to provide social services,"" the minister said. Kuugongelwa-Amadhila further stated that the same applies to the embezzlement of public funds and bribery, which can easily feed on public systems such as tendering and permits, especially those related to the allocation of rights to resources. ""Corruption has the effect of stunting development growth and undermining the efficiency of public administration, and subsequently can result in the erosion of public trust,"" she added. Africa, nonetheless, has made considerable progress on several important fronts in recent years, and governance has also improved. ""A large part of Africa has embraced democratic governance, which has created an environment for combatting corruption and ensuring that the benefits of the continent's vast resources can flow through the communities,"" Kuugongelwa-Amadhila said. Also speaking during the opening ceremony was Swakopmund mayor Rosina //Hoabes, who stated that the conference marks the beginning to stamp out fraud and corruption in Namibia by changing people's mindset. ""We will encourage and organise more campaigns to free Africa from fraud and corruption,"" the mayor said.

ZACC chairman Mr Denford Chirindo said those found on the wrong side of the law would face the consequences. Speaking after the launch of ZACC website in Harare yesterday, Mr Chirindo said no one was ""untouchable"". He said ZAAC was investigating corruption allegations levelled against several high-ranking officials, including Cabinet Ministers and Members of Parliament. Mr Chirindo, however, refused to name those under investigation. ""We are not targeting only the small fish as some people may think. ""There are no sacred cows and all the reports that we have received, including those of several ministers, senior Government officials and MPs are under investigation. ""No one is immune to investigation and if there is enough evidence against the ministers or MPs, we will simply forward the documents to the Attorney-General's office for prosecution."" Mr Chirindo dismissed as ""misinformed"" claims that President Mugabe had ordered the commission not to investigate some Government officials. ""People tend to lie about the President. Our President does not condone corruption. We are an independent body and no one tells us how, who and what to investigate. No one is immune to investigation."" He attributed delays in completing investigations to the complexity of some cases. He said some witnesses were afraid to release the necessary information. ""It is not that we are toothless as some people perceive, but the major challenge is there is no witness protection."" He said ZAAC had requested for funding to ensure the protection of witnesses. ""Another issue is that investigations that involve financial issues are complex and require more time. ""In some instances, a case cannot move forward without the Comptroller and Auditor General's report."" Mr Chirindo said the prosecuting authority lay in the AG's office. ""The laws of this country are clear and it is the AG that can decide to prosecute or not. ""Our duty is to investigate, prepare the dockets and forward them to the AG. If he is happy then he can proceed with prosecution."" He said the commission was failing to fully execute its mandate due to under funding. ""Treasury is not adequately funding us and we can not discharge our duties efficiently,"" he said. ""If you do not fund the police, the AG's office and the ZACC, there will be no movement on some cases because we work together as stakeholders in fighting corruption."" On the new website, Mr Chirindo said it would enable the commission to converse with the public. ""This will assist the public in having the access to ZACC's vision, mandate and operations. ""It is everyone's responsibility to fight corruption and I think we will be in a position to interact with the public and get tips and information,"" he said."325,The Namibian (Windhoek),11/5/12,Corruption Suspect Loses Cars and Cash,,NAMIBIA (93%),Newspaper,Werner Menges,ENGLISH,,,5-Nov-12,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (73%)",446 words,CORRUPTION (92%); ASSET FORFEITURE (91%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); VETERANS (78%); COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS (78%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (77%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (77%); INVESTIGATIONS (76%); AUCTIONS (73%); ARRESTS (72%); MONEY LAUNDERING (72%); CRIME PREVENTION (71%); TRADE DEVELOPMENT (69%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"SEVEN cars, money in a bank account, and more than N$100 000 that was found stashed under the bed of a Ministry of Veterans  Affairs official who is being accused of corruption was declared forfeited to the State in the High Court in Windhoek on Friday. The money and cars are the proceeds of unlawful activities, namely corruption, fraud and money-laundering offences, Prosecutor General Martha Imalwa is alleging in an affidavit filed with the High Court. The Prosecutor General applied for the forfeiture order which was granted by Acting Judge Petrus Unengu in terms of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act of 2004 (POCA). The property involved   five Toyota Corolla cars, two Ford bakkies, money in a bank account, and an amount of N$100 200 which was found hidden under the bed of Ministry of Veterans  Affairs official Mikael Abner   has been the subject of a preservation order which the Prosecutor General obtained in terms of POCA on July 23. The forfeiture order granted on Friday allows the State to sell the cars at a public auction, and to pay the proceeds and the money which has also been declared forfeited into the account of the Criminal Assets Recovery Fund. Abner, who did not oppose the forfeiture application, was arrested in July and charged with fraud. According to Imalwa, it is alleged that Abner is the sole member of a close corporation, TTL Investment, which was registered with the Ministry of Trade and Industry in April. A bank account in the name of TTL Investment was opened on May 9, and Abner is the only signatory on that account, Imalwa says in her affidavit. She claims that the only deposits on that account came from the Ministry of Veterans  Affairs. With a total of N$1 130 200 having been deposited into the close corporation s account, N$818 000 was later withdrawn, Imalwa states. Abner told investigators from the Anti-Corruption Commission that the money kept under the bed was some of the funds which had been withdrawn from the bank account, Imalwa says. It is alleged that Abner submitted quotations from TTL Investment to the Ministry of Veterans  Affairs for approval and payment, supposedly for equipment which was to be bought for war veterans who were receiving assistance in setting up income-generating projects. However, the veterans involved did not obtain quotations from TTL Investment, and while the close corporation received nine payments from the ministry, it did not deliver the goods paid for to the veterans involved, Imalwa is alleging. Abner has bought five Toyota Corolla cars and two Ford bakkies, and it is alleged that these motor vehicles were all bought with the proceeds of crimes, Imalwa says in her affidavit."326,The Herald (Harare),11/16/12,"Of Infill Stands, Corruption [opinion]",,ZIMBABWE (94%),Newspaper,Loverage Nhamoyebonde,ENGLISH,,,16-Nov-12,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (94%)",989 words,CITY GOVERNMENT (90%); SPORTS & RECREATION FACILITIES & VENUES (89%); PARKING SPACES & FACILITIES (89%); POPULATION DENSITY (78%); CHILDREN (77%); CORRUPTION (73%); UNEMPLOYMENT RATES (73%); RURAL COMMUNITIES (72%); BUS STATIONS & TERMINALS (64%); WETLANDS (53%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Land and Rural Issues,"Town planners of former times had done a noble job by leaving open spaces when they allocated residential stands throughout Harare's suburbs. Several open spaces where left unoccupied for use as play grounds, open markets and or recreational facilities. Churches, community halls and home industries were also supposed to be accommodated on these open spaces. They also did not forget that densely populated areas needed breathing space and these open spaces ensured free circulation of air. Was that not great wisdom and incomparable intelligence? The year 2008 saw a new breed of councillors and council officials coming on board. They were mandated to develop or prepare these open spaces to serve the required purposes. It is very interesting how they are failing to accomplish the assignment given to them. Some local authorities are being pushed by greed and their strong desire for money, hence the creation of ""infill stands."" Today the open spaces have disappeared and stands are filling up even the important wetlands. The situation seems to continue unabated. Open spaces that were left to serve as car parks, markets are teetering on the edge of a cliff and it takes only the slightest push to send them into extinction. Councillors and council officials have proved to be that push and within a year so, there will be no open space left in Harare and Chitungwiza. It all started in Chitungwiza and like cancer, the situation spread to other residential areas in Harare. The situation is rife in Kuwadzana, where allocations of residential stands seems to be a never-ending phenomenon. In Kuwadzana 6, a filling station is being constructed on a land previously serving as a football field. The filling station was prioritised over recreation as the football pitch has less commercial value. All open spaces in Kuwadzana 5 are now occupied with houses. The bus terminus is the only open space left and it is now being used as a car park. No more space is left for recreational purposes, markets or home industries and residents are left vulnerable to the effects of high unemployment rate. As if the example that was demonstrated in several residential areas across the country was too strong to avoid imitating, residential stands have been allocated on an open space supposed to serve as a flea market in Kuwadzana Extension. Mrs Shupikai Marowa explained how this new development is negatively impacting their community. ""They are constructing houses on the land initially used as a car park and market place. ""Most of the space is now occupied and residents have to find other alternatives if they want to park their cars. ""It is very unfortunate that our stands are too small and there is no space to park our vehicles and we only wish that council will come up with a solution to this problem,"" she said. She added that Kuwadzana Extension is one of the residential areas without recreational facilities and children do not have properly designated playing fields. A school leaver, who identified himself as Blessed Tomu, expressed his concern over council's misplaced priorities. He explained how these open spaces can be used to accommodate home industries and markets. ""With the unemployment rate rising, our only hope of survival was pinned on the informal sector and the action taken by the council is meant to worsen our plight. ""What is more worrisome is the fact that these infill stands are not genuinely addressing housing problems because most of the beneficiaries have multiple properties. ""This move was taken with only one goal of making council officials rich at the expense of our rights as residents,"" said Tomu. A resident of Kuwadzana Extension, Mr Lameck Moyo, said as a result of the shortage of employment on the job market, residents are now relying on flea markets and home industries to eke out a living. ""Council is not prioritising important issues that economically empower residents so that they will be able to pay rates. ""If council makes proper use of these open spaces they will generate revenue and residents in turn, will have money to pay water bills and other rates. ""The absence of properly designated markets and home industries will make council lose revenue and residents will always fail to pay rates as there will be no sources of income,"" said Moyo. Kuwadzana Extension Ward 44 Councillor Richard Masunda said when stands were allocated by the Zimbabwe Building Society in the mid 1990s, no accurate measurements were used. This has resulted in lots of land left idle for no specific reason. ""We recently allocated stands on an open space previously reserved for market stalls. ""The space was too large and we decided to use part of the land for residential stands,"" said Cllr Masunda. He said that not all open spaces are going to be allocated housing stands and that they were currently looking for developers who could work on the open spaces and turn them into flea markets or similarly important purposes. If all open spaces are occupied by houses, only God knows where the land to be developed into markets, home industries and recreational facilities is going to come from. Residents of Kuwadzana Extension presented aired their views during the Council budget deliberations held at Kuwadzana 8 Primary School recently. They requested Council to construct a community hall, sporting facilities, home industries and flea markets on all the open spaces left in the area. The council officials promised to look into these issues but what baffles the mind is the fact that the land where these developments are supposed to take place was invaded by ""infill stands"". The issue of infill stands has been going on for too long now and open spaces in all residential areas in Harare and Chitungwiza are fast disappearing. The time is now ripe for a paradigm shift but residents are overwhelmingly silent on these new developments and responsible authorities are still occupied with fattening their pockets."327,The Namibian (Windhoek),11/16/12,?Corruption? in Supreme Court?s Sights,,NAMIBIA (94%),Newspaper,Werner Menges,ENGLISH,,,16-Nov-12,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (57%)",771 words,CORRUPTION (95%); SUPREME COURTS (90%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); APPEALS (90%); VERDICTS (90%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (90%); ACQUITTAL (78%); JUDGES (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (65%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"A PUBLIC servant who abuses his or her public office or position for private gain can be found guilty of corruption, the Supreme Court has indicated in an appeal judgement which was handed down yesterday. In an important judgement for the interpretation of some key sections of the Anti-Corruption Act of 2004, the Supreme Court has given reasons for its decision to reverse the discharge that former National Assembly Secretary Nama Goabab and National Assembly Chief Accountant Abraham John George received on corruption charges in the High Court in Windhoek in August 2010. The Supreme Court s decision, which was given on the same day that the court heard arguments on an appeal by the state against the acquittal of Goabab and George on the main charges of corruption which they faced in their trial before Judge Marlene Tommasi, meant that the two men s trial had to continue on those main charges. Judge Tommasi was due to deliver her verdict in the men s trial yesterday. Her judgement was however postponed to November 30. In the Supreme Court s reasons for its decision of June 27, Chief Justice Peter Shivute pointed out that after the Anti-Corruption Act became part of the law in Namibia, the offence of corruption has become broad in its reach and scope. This appears necessary because corruption may manifest itself in different shapes and forms. It is also notoriously difficult to prove, because it often does not take place in full view of the public,  the Chief Justice stated. By including a wide scope of acts in the definition of corruption, Namibia is following an international trend, the Chief Justice also noted:  The wide scope and ambit of the crime appears to be international in nature. It demonstrates the international community s resolve that corruption is an invidious crime that, if left unchecked, can erode a country s gains in all spheres of human endeavour. Chief Justice Shivute went on to state:  It suffices for the purposes of this judgment to hold that the word  corruption , at its lowest threshold when used in the context of the public service, includes the abuse of a public office or position (including the powers and resources associated with it) for personal gain. The main charges against Goabab and George were under the Anti-Corruption Act s section 43(1), which states:  A public officer commits an offence who, directly or indirectly, corruptly uses his or her office or position in a public body to obtain any gratification, whether for the benefit of himself or herself or any other person. In another section of the Act, it is explicitly stated that  gratification includes any discount which a public officer is alleged to have obtained, the Chief Justice pointed out. Goabab and George jointly face two main charges of corruptly using their office or position for gratification, and alternative counts of fraud or theft. They pleaded not guilty to all charges at the start of their trial at the end of March 2010. They are accused of having illegally rented two vehicles at Government s cost for Goabab s private use during March and April 2007. The total cost of the vehicle rentals is alleged to have been N$23 552,20, of which N$18 497,20 was actually paid by the National Assembly. The first vehicle was rented at a discounted government rate, which Goabab would not have been charged if he had rented the car in his private capacity. Goabab alone is also charged with a third count of corruptly using his office or position for gratification, alternatively using a motor vehicle without the owner s consent, in connection with allegations that he had unlawfully used a Government vehicle on May 25 2007 while he was receiving a motor vehicle allowance as part of his salary. The evidence which the prosecution placed before Judge Tommasi showed that Goabab and George knew of the lower rates which the car rental company involved offered to Government, and that they acted together to obtain gratification in the form of lower rates for Goabab, the Chief Justice said. On the third charge, the prosecution s evidence showed that, as a beneficiary of a car allowance who could use State vehicles only in certain circumscribed circumstances, Goabab corruptly used his office or position for gratification when he effectively allocated a Government-owned car to himself for private use, the Chief Justice found. He emphasised that these were prima facie views of the Supreme Court, based only on the evidence before the accused men had presented their defence case to the court. Judges of Appeal Gerhard Maritz and Sylvester Mainga agreed with the Chief Justice s judgement."328,The Namibian (Windhoek),11/16/12,Magistrate Back in Court On Corruption Charges,,NAMIBIA (95%),Newspaper,Werner Menges,ENGLISH,,,16-Nov-12,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (93%)",348 words,CORRUPTION (92%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (91%); ARRESTS (78%); BRIBERY (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); VEHICULAR OFFENSES (78%); GUILTY PLEAS (78%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (78%); JUDGES (77%); LAWYERS (75%); ARREST WARRANTS (73%); BAIL (72%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE case in which a former Oshakati-based magistrate is charged with multiple counts under the Anti-Corruption Act has been transferred from the High Court at Oshakati to Windhoek. Suspended Magistrate Melaney Theron made a first pre-trial appearance before Judge President Petrus Damaseb in the High Court in Windhoek yesterday. She had previously appeared in the High Court at Oshakati, until her case was transferred to Windhoek. Judge President Damaseb informed Theron that her case has been assigned to Judge Nate Ndauendapo, in front of whom she would have to make her next pre-trial court appearance on January 23. Theron remains free on bail, and suspended from her position as magistrate. She told The Namibian yesterday that she would be pleading not guilty to all of the charges she is facing, and that she denies the allegations being made against her. Theron is facing a total of 20 main charges. Those main charges are made up of seven counts of corruptly using her office or position for gratification, five counts of fraudulently concealing an offence, which is also an offence under the Anti-Corruption Act, two charges of corruptly soliciting or accepting or agreeing to accept a bribe, and six counts of defeating or obstructing the course of justice. The offences that Theron is accused of are alleged to have been committed at the Oshakati Magistrate_ s Court, where she was stationed, between May 26 2011 and August 15 2011. Theron is alleged to have accepted amounts of money, totalling N$6 600, from various people who were accused of traffic offences. She allegedly used that money for her personal benefit. It is also alleged that she cancelled warrants of arrest which had been issued against the accused traffic offenders, and that she in some instances recorded on court records that the cases against the people had been withdrawn or that they had been cautioned after they had pleaded guilty, while they in fact had not appeared in court.

Chief Resident Magistrate Joshua Banda jailed Charles Mubanga of Sikanze Camp after he found him guilty of soliciting K400,000 from a suspect. Vincent Tembo, now deceased, were charged with one count of corrupt practices by public servant. Between November 1 and November 13 in 2006 in Lusaka, Mubanga and Tembo being sub-inspector and sergeant respectively in the Zambia Police Service did solicit K400,000 cash gratification from Mr Mwansa Kashilubaya. The money was meant for the officers to discontinue a case in which Mr Kashilubaya was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Mr Banda said when passing his judgment that he would exercise maximum lenience against Mubanga because the loss of his job was punishment enough for him to learn his lesson. Mubanga had during his mitigation pleaded with the court to exercise maximum lenience saying he had already lost his job as a police officer emanating from his misconduct. He had told the court that he was the first offender, married with three children and as such he deserved to be given a second chance. The magistrate sent Mubanga to jail for six months with hard labour, but the convict applied for bail pending appeal. Mr Banda granted Mubanga a K10 million bail in his own recognisance pending his appeal to the High Court. He ordered Mubanga to provide two working sureties from recognised institutions."330,The Herald (Harare),11/23/12,Magistrates Face Corruption Probe,,ZIMBABWE (92%),Newspaper,Daniel Nemukuyu,ENGLISH,,,23-Nov-12,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (77%)",524 words,MAGISTRATES (92%); MISCONDUCT (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (90%); CORRECTIONS (89%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (89%); APPEALS (87%); FINES & PENALTIES (78%); MISSING PERSONS (78%); BAIL (77%); APPEALS COURTS (77%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"SEVERAL magistrates face dismissal after the Judicial Service Commission unearthed massive corruption and cases of misconduct during ongoing investigations. At least two of them have since appeared in court this month charged with criminal abuse of office. Sources said five others - three of them from Mashonaland Central - are set to appear before an inquiry by chief magistrate Mr Mishrod Guvamombe for various offences. The cases were discovered during the ongoing monitoring and supervision exercise involving visits by Mr Guvamombe's team to the country's provinces inspecting records at the courts. Those charged with criminal abuse of office were Augustine Borerwe of Bindura Magistrates' Court and Stephen Mavuna of Kezi. The two have also appeared before the chief magistrate's inquiry and now await appearance before a disciplinary hearing to be set up by the JSC head office. Offences unearthed by the visits include corruptly releasing prisoners, letting prisoners go without following proper procedures and failure to send court records for review, appeal and scrutiny. JSC secretary Justice Rita Makarau yesterday said intensive supervision was the commission's thrust to ensure high standards of professionalism. ""We are a new employer. That is our thrust as JSC. We have intensified supervision on magistrates,"" she said. ""We are surely on the ground and as we visit the provinces, irregularities are discovered and magistrates, where necessary, are being charged. ""Depending with the gravity of the offences, some are discharged while others are fined or reprimanded. Those convicted for corruption related charges face dismissal. ""There other rare cases of mere incompetence, which attract lighter penalties."" Justice Makarau said Mr Guvamo-mbe was in Mashonaland West yesterday as part of the supervisory strategy. ""As we speak, Mr Guvamombe is in Chinhoyi as part of the ongoing supervision exercise,"" she said. Borerwe (43) last Friday appeared before Harare regional magistrate Mr Hosea Mujaya for allegedly releasing eight convicts on bail pending appeal when they had not filed any appeals at the High Court. He allegedly committed the offence between 2009 and 2011 while still stationed at Guruve Magistrates' Court. Mr Mujaya released Borerwe on US$100 bail and he will be back in court next week. Mavuna (30) of Kezi was arraigned before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Tawanda Muchemwa for allegedly causing the disappearance of court records, which were meant for review and scrutiny. He allegedly committed the offences between 2009 and this year when he was still stationed at Plumtree Magistrates' Court. Mavuna allegedly imposed sentences that required records to be sent to a higher court for scrutiny and review at the High Court. It is the State's case that Mavuna failed to submit the records of proceedings and kept them in his office, leading to their disappearance. Sources say the discovery of such cases was also necessitated by the recent reshuffle of some 60 magistrates countrywide. ""When the magistrates were transferred, those entering new offices would discover the anomalies before informing the superiors,"" said the sources."331,The Herald (Harare),11/24/12,"NCA Accuses MDC-T of Corruption, Factionalism",,ZIMBABWE (93%),Newspaper,Takunda Maodza,ENGLISH,,,26-Nov-12,,527 words,CORRUPTION (90%); PRIME MINISTERS (89%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (89%); RULE OF LAW (78%); REFERENDUMS (73%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Governance; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"The National Constitutional Assembly has accused the MDC-T of corruption and factionalism as the rift between the two widens. The MDC-T and the NCA have been partners since the emergence of the MDC in 1999 and used to stage joint demonstrations meant to undemocratically oust Zanu-PF from power. Acrimony between the NCA and the MDC-T has been worsened by Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's stance on the constitution-making process. The MDC-T supports the draft constitution produced by Copac and its leader Mr Morgan Tsvangirai is on record urging his party to support the document during the referendum. The NCA feels betrayed by the MDC-T, which it accuses of being unprincipled. In statement yesterday, the NCA said: ""Categorically, we wish to tell the MDC-T to stop fooling Zimbabweans to support this scandalous draft, which they crafted together with Zanu-PF so that they enjoy the same powers. Instead, their focus should be in dealing with their internal problems, which range from corruption, factionalism, waning popularity and not spending time attacking the NCA and its leadership for its principled stance on the drafting of a new charter for Zimbabwe."" The statement said the MDC-T cannot lecture the NCA on constitution-making after the party branded Prof Madhuku's stance on the draft document ""childish"" and accused him of behaving like ""someone on a Zanu-PF payroll"". ""For the MDC-T to want to lecture the NCA and its leadership on constitutionalism is the height of political hypocrisy and a deliberate continual misleading of its supporters in order for its leaders to continue feeding at the ill-gotten trough of personalised political opportunism and naivety,"" the NCA said. The NCA accused the MDC-T of deviating from its founding principles especially on the constitution-making. ""We have no business with the MDC whatsoever, as they are not part of NCA because of their chameleonic tendencies of being part of a bogus and illegitimate money spinning constitution-making process,"" the NCA said. The NCA challenged the MDC-T to embrace the basic tenets of democracy and to accept criticism. It warned that the MDC-T was fighting a losing battle with Zanu-PF. Yesterday the MDC-T tried to play down the rift between the party and the NCA. ""There is no bad relationship between the NCA and the MDC-T. The only problem that had arisen was the abusive language directed at the Prime Minister attributed to Professor Madhuku which was published in the Sunday Mail where PM Tsvangirai was described as childish,"" said MDC-T spokesperson Mr Douglas Mwonzora. He added: ""The position of the NCA is well known to us and is respected by us. ""What we do not appreciate is the hate and abusive language being attributed to the NCA otherwise the MDC and NCA are brothers and sisters in same struggle."" Last week Prof Madhuku criticised PM Tsvangirai for blaming President Mugabe and Zanu-PF for supposedly hampering the smooth flow of the constitution-making process saying all national leaders should take full responsibility for political processes in the country. He said PM Tsvangirai demonstrated childishness following disagreements over the draft constitution."332,The New Times (Kigali),11/28/12,Anti-Corruption Week to Focus On Youth Engagement,,RWANDA (79%),Newspaper,Susan Babijja,ENGLISH,,,29-Nov-12,"KIGALI, RWANDA (50%)",341 words,CORRUPTION (94%); PRESS CONFERENCES (57%); HOTELS & MOTELS (50%) Rwanda; Corruption; Children and Youth,"The national anti-corruption week will focus on educating and sensitising the public specifically the youth to actively become involved in the fight against graft. The Chief Ombudsman, Aloysia Cyanzaire, yesterday said that involving the youth in the campaign would serve a purpose. She made the remarks during a press briefing to highlight the various activities that will be carried out through the week. ""Involving the young generation will build a strong foundation that will not only educate the youth about the negative effects of corruption on the individual and the country,"" Cyanzaire said. The week that will be launched at the national level in Gisagara District, Southern Province will start on the December 5 with visits to different districts including Nyabihu, Kamonyi and Bugesera to review progress. During the week, there will be sensitisation campaigns to encourage the public to play a key role in preventing corruption. Cyanzaire explained that the decision to launch the event in Gisagara District is due to the outstanding commitment the district had demonstrated in good governance. Last year, Gisagara District emerged winner among other districts in the fourth annual good governance competition that was organised by the Office of the Ombudsman as part of several activities organised during the 2011 anti-corruption week. ""We need the same spirit that will enable us to build a corruption free nation, and this will eventually speed-up our development programmes,"" she said. Officials at the Ombudsman's Office say that despite government's commitment and achievements in fighting graft, one of the key challenges frustrating the campaign is fear and failure by the public to testify or provide evidence against culprits. The week will end on the December 9, which is the International Anti-Corruption Day. Officials will also educate stakeholders and the general public on the need to testify against such cases.

The Premier made the remarks on Wednesday while officiating at the launch of the national anti-corruption week, an annual exercise which focuses on educating and sensitising the public to actively become involved in the fight against graft. While addressing thousands of residents in Ndora sector, Gisagara district, the premier reaffirmed the government's resolve towards ending the vices. ""Though our fight [against corruption] is yielding good results, we want to keep moving forward until we have a society free from corruption,"" he stated. He noted that over the past years, Rwanda has gone a long way in addressing corruption but added that the fight still goes on. ""We are proud of our strategies [to fight corruption]"", he said. ""They are paying off,"" Habumuremyi added, as he referred to a recent report which ranked Rwanda the third least corrupt country in the Sub-Saharan Africa. He warned anyone who still has ""a heart of taking or giving a bribe"" that he will be dealt with accordingly. ""Everyone is watching,"" he warned. ""All institutions and organs have established mechanisms to fight graft. If you think you will give or take a bribe and go unnoticed, you are in for a bad shock."" ""If you are among those who still have the heart of taking or giving a bribe, know that your days are numbered."" He commended the Office of the Ombudsman for its continuous efforts to put an end to corruption. He urged residents to desist from ""buying services you are entitled to,"" and warned leaders against the malpractice. ""You should not give your property to gain access to what you are entitled to,"" he told the public. ""Neither should you pay to gain unfair advantages from leaders,"" he added. Premier Habumuremyi called on the general public to denounce anyone why tries to seek a bribe from them. ""Do not fear reprisals. No one will harm you if you report such malpractices. The government will protect you,"" he added. He referred to the proposal to give the Office of the Ombudsman mandate to prosecute some corruption related cases as another strategy to ensure that the crime is eradicated. ""We want a society free from corruption and injustices,"" he stated, before adding:""We have strategies to achieve our objectives."" The Chief Ombudsman, Aloysie Cyanzayire, noted that during the Anti-Corruption week there will be sensitisation campaigns to encourage the public to play a leading role in preventing corruption. She congratulated of Gisagara District for ""its outstanding commitment in fighting corruption and championing good governance"". For the last four years, Gisagara has emerged among top two districts in the annual good governance competitions organised by the Office of the Ombudsman, Cyanzayire said. The National Anti-Corruption Week is an occasion to reflect on the negative effects of corruption and injustices on the individual and the country, in general, and take measures to combat them. This year's campaign will end on December 9 which is the International Anti-Corruption Day. The day signifies global efforts to combat corruption besides providing an opportunity to create awareness and commitment to curb graft. The launch of the week was attended by senior government officials, including the Minister of Justice and Attorney General, Tharcisse Karugarama, the Minister of Internal security Sheikh Moussa Fazil Harerimana and the Minister in the President's Office, Venantia Tugireyezu. Also in attendance were delegations from the African Union, Burundi, Kenya, Senegal, Egypt and South Sudan."335,New Democrat (Monrovia),12/5/12,LACC's Alarming Tearful Portrait of Irresistible Corruption,,LIBERIA (92%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,5-Dec-12,"MONROVIA, LIBERIA (72%)",688 words,CORRUPTION (90%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (76%); ORDINANCES (75%); INVESTIGATIONS (72%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (68%) Liberia; Corruption,"After serving 19 years walking on chalkline as vice president under the towering powers of President William VS Tubman, William R. Tobert, Jr., assumed the presidency upon the demise of Tubman in 1971. Tolbert had been handpicked by his predecessor following the mystery death of vice president-elect B.G. Freeman of Careysburg. Tolbert's long tenure as vice president must have prepared him to first zoom on punctuality and hard work for government officials and employees just as he was exemplary for workers on his Belefanai farm in Bong County. That example focused on sound practice of honesty and probity for which Tolbert's detractors misunderstood and satirically accused him of selling charcoal and bitter balls at the Executive. His disgust that corruption permeated government circles and society at large led Tolbert in 1974 to create by executive ordinance the National Force for the Eradication of Corruption (NFEC), comprising law enforcement gurus and legal luminaries having teeth enough to investigate graft cases and recommend appropriate penalties for guilty persons. But corruption outlived the NFEC so much that young AFL soldiers who overthrew the government in 1980 accused it not only of corruption, but ""rampant corruption"". Soon on his second day in power, Master-sergeant Samuel Doe, made the following independent statement to then Principal Robert Kemokai on corruption while on a tour at Central High School in Buzzi Quarters: ""There are some people...when they receive 25 loaves of bread for their students, they eat 15 and only 10 reach to the students. That is rampant corruption...anyone found doing that will not live to tell the story"". Soon than later 'you will not live to tell the story' became a household expression in Liberia. As the crackdown waned with time while the junta enjoyed the paraphernalia of power, Doe once publicly declared: ""Corruption cannot be completely eradicated, but can only be minimized."" Therefore it became an irony that he later perished in a gorilla rebellion whose masterminds accused him of being a dictator engaged in rampant corruption. Earlier this year, corruption typified itself to me at one Hathai shop downtown Monrovia where some young people castigated persons outside their midst for being corrupt. Upon hearing them in the debate, a keen passerby suddenly invited one of their kind to follow him for ""something"" for them to buy their tea. Their envoy later came back with US$20 saying the man: ""I accompanied sent this for us all."" Everyone expressed delight for the offer and began ordering more tea. But it was not too long when the giver appeared, asking: ""Did you guys see what I sent you?"" ""You mean the 20 dollars,"" one of them shouted. He replied, ""No! I sent you 100 dollars."" His colleagues suddenly got raged, knocked him over and forcibly ripped pockets where 80 dollars found hidden was removed by the group. Upon hearing the true story, some onlookers at the scene commented: ""But he did well she, he should have divided the money 50-50""; he should have gone home with the whole amount and not return to the Hathai shop"". So, see how corruption is alive with us even after President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf declared it was ""enemy number one"" during his first inaugural speech seven years ago."" Now Cllr. Frances Johnson Allison, head of Liberia's Anti-Corruption Commission, is shedding tears over the entrenchment of corruption, though expressing courageous optimism that it can wiped out or minimized through wholesome involvement of every citizen in the battle against this menace. Cllr. Allison complaint that inadequate human and logistic capacity posed a challenge to investigate corruption cases clearly indicates that her agency is being overwhelmed by graft cases due to these constraints and uncooperative attitudes of partner institutions. Furthermore, her assertion that ""corruption is entrenched within the society; it cannot be fixed in a single day; it takes time,"" is a warning to Liberians to get ready now to put on their armor for an epic battle with corruption, otherwise it will sooner than later ruin the fabric of our society."336,The Namibian (Windhoek),12/6/12,Nation Still Has Corruption Label,,NAMIBIA (94%),Newspaper,Jo-Mar_ Duddy,ENGLISH,,,6-Dec-12,,283 words,CORRUPTION (93%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%) Namibia; Corruption; Governance,"NAMIBIA continues to have a  serious problem  with corruption in the eyes of the world, a new report by Transparency International showed yesterday. The watchdog gave Namibia a score of 48 in its 2012 Corruption Perception Index (CPI), the country s best in a decade, but still below the 50-point threshold which labels it as corrupt. The CPI scores countries on a scale from zero (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean).  While no country has a perfect score, two-thirds of countries scored below 50, indicating a serious corruption problem,  Transparency International said. Namibia has been unable to reach a score of 50 and above since 2003. It managed to stay above 50 from 1998 to 2002, with its all-time high of 57 reached in 1998. It s 2012 score of 48 mean Namibia was ranked 58th out of 178 countries worldwide on the CPI, slipping one place from last year. Transparency International yesterday said  after a year with a global focus on corruption, we expected more governments to take a tougher stance against the abuse of power . The CPI results demonstrate that there are still many societies and governments that need to give a much higher priority to this issue, the watchdog said. Corruption destroys lives and communities, and undermines countries and institutions. It generates popular anger that threatens to further destabilise societies and exacerbate violent conflicts,  it said. Transparency International said governments need to integrate anti-corruption actions into all aspects of decision-making. They must prioritise better rules on lobbying and political financing, make public spending and contracting more transparent, and make public bodies more accountable,  the watchdog said."339,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),12/7/12,Sata Chides Anti-Corruption Commission,,ZAMBIA (92%),Newspaper,KAIKO NAMUSA,ENGLISH,,,7-Dec-12,"LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (57%)",728 words,INVESTIGATIONS (93%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (89%); APPOINTMENTS (79%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (79%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (78%); BRIBERY (78%); ACADEMIC STANDARDS (77%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (72%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (64%); OIL & GAS INDUSTRY (63%); TEACHER RECRUITMENT & HIRING (60%) Zambia; Corruption; Governance,"PRESIDENT Michael Sata has castigated the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) for announcing cases under investigation to the public and called for restoration of sanity to the institution. The Head of State also said the Teaching Service Commission (TSC) requires urgent attention so as to motivate the teaching fraternity. Mr Sata said this when he swore in ACC Commissioner Rollen Mukanda and seven members of the TSC headed by Jennipher Chiwela, a renowned educationalist, at State House in Lusaka yesterday. Mr Sata said it was wrong for the ACC to reveal its investigations in the media as this was against the rules of natural justice that required persons being probed to have a chance to exculpate themselves. This was in an apparent reference to the manner the ACC had handled the investigation involving Justice Minister Wynter Kabimba and his Defence counterpart Geoffrey Mwamba. Mr Sata said he would not suspend anyone on mere allegations but wait until the ACC proves a solid case against a public officer. ""I won't suspend anybody unless you prove to me. The law says if you have a senior official you want to investigate, come and get permission from me. You don't go to the Press and say we are investigating somebody. That's the MMD's way of doing things,"" he said. Mr Kabimba was summoned to the ACC offices for questioning on Monday this week but the matter failed to take off after he refused to be interviewed in private, insisting that the matter was already in the public domain. Mr Kabimba is alleged to have received 'kickbacks' from Trafigura to influence a US$500 million oil deal, while Mr Mwamba was being investigated over a bid by a firm in which he has interest for the supply of poles to Zesco. ""How would you feel, if you are being investigated in the Times of Zambia, natural justice demands that an accused person should be given a chance to be heard, and not investigated in the newspaper. ""Don't rush to the newspapers, give suspects the right to be heard as well, just like you enjoy your rights. I won't fire anyone without proof,"" Mr Sata said. On the TSC, the President said there was need for inspiration levels to be heightened so as to motivate both teachers and pupils. He expressed worry at the increase in examination leakages and defilement cases, adding that teacher recruitment should be professional to ensure the standards of education were improved. ""I don't know what has gone wrong to the Teaching Service Commission, you have to improve, you are dealing with people of a tender age and they need inspiration,"" Mr Sata said. He warned that he would not hesitate to dissolve the Commission if it failed to perform to people's expectations. ""Just the way I have appointed this Commission, that is the same way I can disband it if you do not perform, I don't need a Press briefing to disband it, I can just do it by the stroke of a pen,"" Mr Sata said. Ms Mukanda is a qualified agriculturalist with vast experience in both the public and private sectors. In 2004, she was appointed technical coordinator in the agri-business component of the Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Natural Resources. In 2006, she became technical coordinator in the policy and planning department in the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. She left the civil service in 2007 to join the Zambia National Women's Lobby as executive director, a position she held until May, this year. Since then, she has been a freelance consultant in agri-business and gender development. Ms Chiwela has worked in the field of education for the past 42 years and draws her vast professional work experience from village to international levels. She is chairperson of the African Network Campaign on Education for All. Ms Chiwela is also the co-founder of the People's Action Forum, an indigenous non-governmental organisation established to assist capacity building of rural communities through both formal and non-formal education. Through the organisation's programme activities, Ms Chiwela became actively involved in the Education for All initiative, taking part with other NGOs in the national assessment process in 1999. She also participated in both the International Consultation of NGOs/CSOs and the World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal. Other members of the TSC are Agness Nyoni, Alfred Sikazwe, David Kandolondo, Justo Chishimba, Kajet Kayama, and Robam Mwaba."340,The New Times (Kigali),12/8/12,Cyclists in Fight Against Corruption,,RWANDA (90%),Newspaper,Peter Kamasa,ENGLISH,,,9-Dec-12,"KIGALI, RWANDA (58%)",209 words,CYCLING (95%); CORRUPTION (92%); SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (91%); TOURNAMENTS (90%); STADIUMS & ARENAS (73%) Rwanda; Corruption; Sport,"This year's Anti -Corruption cycling competition sponsored by the Ombudsman Office in conjunction with the Rwanda Cycling Federation is set for today.

Corruption undoubtedly has been a retrogressive vice which has led the country to lose colossal sums of money which would have been otherwise channelled towards projects aimed at bettering the living standards of the people. Many Zambian have been wallowing in poverty 48 years after independence partly because of greedy individuals who have been pocketing the country's resources for personal gratification. We therefore commend the Patriotic Front (PF) Government for seriously sticking to one of its campaign promises of stamping out graft. During the last one year of being office, the Government has shown strong political will in ensuring that the country's resources are not abused by selfish individuals who are entrusted to run public affairs. The Government has made tremendous strides in fighting corruption in the past one year as evidenced by a number of measures which have been put in place to stop graft which need to be supported by all stakeholders. One of these measures is the reintroduction of the abuse of authority of office clause in the Anti-Corruption Act. This has so far sounded a bell in the minds of people who go in public service to amass wealth at the expense of the poor Zambians. The abuse of authority clause and many other very progressive clauses have been handy in deterring public officials from mismanaging and stealing public resources. Zambians were in the past subjected to shoddy services because the meager resources ended up in the pockets of some people. We see the country prospering in the next few years as the monies intended for development projects would properly be utilised under a watchful eye. Secondly, Government's move to increase funding to the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) and other law enforcement agencies in the 2012 and 2013 national Budgets is a huge leap in the right direction in trying to fight corruption. These important institutions have been failing to undertake their critical roles because of poor funding which has been hampering investigations and operations. But with increased funding, the ACC and other law enforcement agencies would be able to operate effectively and timely in the bid to significantly reduce graft in Zambia. Another important milestone scored in the fight against corruption is Government's willingness to grant the ACC necessary independence for it to perform its work without any external pressure. President Michael Sata has time and again reaffirmed and assured the nation that Government would not interfere in the operations of the ACC but would instead create an enabling environment for them to execute their mandate independently. These and many other interventions are key in helping fight corruption which has seen our country lagging behind in terms of development. However, all these efforts would remain fruitless if all Zambians are not involved in the fight, and the fight must start now. There is no better time than now to push the crusade against corruption forward by putting into practice this year's theme, ""Act against Corruption Today."" The fight against graft requires patriotism among all Zambians and should not just be left to the Government and law enforcement agencies. We should all be alert and be whistle-blowers. It is by doing so that these law enforcement agencies will operate effectively and reduce the scourge to a bare minimum."343,The Herald (Harare),12/12/12,'No Sacred Cows in Fighting Corruption',,ZIMBABWE (96%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,12-Dec-12,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (58%)",342 words,CORRUPTION (97%); RELIGION (90%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (89%); CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY (86%); POPULATION SIZE (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (75%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (73%) Zimbabwe; Corruption,"THE Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission says it will investigate people accused of corruption regardless of one's standing in society.

Mr Chirindo said this at the weekend during the commemoration of the United Nations Anti-Corruption Day. ""The Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission will not have sacred cows in its bid to combat corruption in the country,"" he said. ""While this is so, may we all be reminded that the fight against corruption requires a collective engagement among various organisations, groups and individuals. ""The successful fight against corruption will inevitably ensure accountability, responsibility, transparency and good corporate governance both in public and private sectors.""

""As such it might be a fact that the greater percentage of people who engage in corruption are Christians or religious,"" he said. The commemorations were held in Harare and Bulawayo the major commercial, industrial and administrative centres. Mr Chirindo said the two cities were seriously affected by the growth of corruption activities in business and at nearly all points of service delivery. ""There is a rise in white collar crimes both in the public and private sectors of the economy,"" he said. Mr Chirindo said the Commission had adopted a three pronged approach in the fight against corruption. They are publicity and education, prevention and good corporate governance and thorough investigations leading to prosecution. ""The main thrust of the Commission's work is prevention. However, where it fails then prosecution, after thorough investigations shall triumph,"" he said. Mr Chirindo urged organisations and communities to put in place mechanisms to strengthen integrity, accountability and transparency.

At the Gbarnga conference, Chief Karwah claimed that many college graduates employed in government offices perform dismally on the job, adding, ""there are people who don't have degrees, but know the job. So you must revisit that, Madam President,"" he observed. ""If we want this vision 2030 to work, we must look into that,"" he noted.

Khorixas municipality human resource head Eben Xoagub, head of housing Daniel Geiseb and CEO Nicodemus #Gaeseb were arrested last year for alleged fraud following an Anti-Corruption Commission investigation. The three are out on bail of N$30 000. The demonstration gathered at Eddie Bowe Soccer Field in front of the Khorixas Town Council offices and chanted slogans calling for the removal of the three officials. They also demanded the reconnection of water supply that was disconnected over unpaid bills and that a new debtors' system be implemented within 60 days. The demonstrators, who presented a petition for the attention of the Khorixas mayor, Tryphosa Moloto, said they would camp at the council offices until their demands were met. The residents were also angry about the lack of development in Khorixas as there is only one supermarket, which is very expensive. The residents also wanted to know what has happened with the rehabilitation of boreholes at Khorixas and when the Donkerhoek informal settlement residents who were relocated on the order by the Khorixas council will be compensated. According to Mistake !Hoaeb of the Khorixas Huidere Development Committee, the demonstration was to protest against water disconnections. ""Khorixas residents are punished with the closure of water if there is an existing housing debt. Water is a basic human right and just because someone has a housing debt the council closes it,"" he told The Namibian. !Hoaeb and demonstrators visited the home of 75-year-old Lukas /Howoseb whose water supply has been cut off because of an outstanding N$50 debt years ago. /Howoseb said: ""I was born 75 years ago in this town but I feel like a foreigner because of the way Khorixas council treats me.""

Ms Banda of Villa Number Three, Plot 2758 off Leopards Hill Road, New Kasama wants the Lusaka High Court to order with costs, the reversal of the restriction notice to lease or dispose of the property issued by the ACC against her property. She wants in the alternative, the Court to annul the restriction notice and allow her to lease out the property and employ property managers. Ms Banda, who sued in her capacity as director of the project wants the Court to award her damages for the loss of time on the project. She said she was the lawful owner of the property at Stand Number 1F/488A/29A, Leopards Hill Road. The former First Lady filed an affidavit in support of originating summons in the Principal Registry through her lawyers of Central Chambers yesterday. She contended that Mpundu Trust Limited was established in 2009 to look after the interests of her twins and their future education and health needs. She said she applied to Access Bank Zambia Limited for a loan of up to US$600,000 for the completion of the construction of the 12 residential properties. Ms Banda said on April 9, 2009 the bank offered her the loan and on February 16 2011 she again applied to the bank asking for a further loan of up to $1 million for the completion of construction. She said the agreement was that the rentals for the lease of the flats would help pay off the loan. Ms Banda added that she obtained an additional $1 million loan from Hands Industries LCC of Dubai. On January 4, this year, she received a restriction notice issued under Section 56 of the ACC Act number 38 of 2010 directing her not to dispose of or deal with the property. She said the restriction notice was issued on the pretext that ACC was conducting investigations into offences alleged to or suspected to have been committed under part III of ACC Act number 38 of 2010. Ms Banda said ever since the notice was issued, she had never been informed of the offence under investigations. ""I reasonably believe that no investigations are being conducted and the issue of restriction notices is an act of harassment and amounts to abuse of authority by the respondent. The restriction notice has scared any possible tenants in the project and the whole project is in jeopardy,"" Ms Banda said. Ms Banda said the issuance of the restriction notices was unreasonable and defied logic. She said the Commission was well aware that the funding for the project was dependent upon the project being leased out and that she has not committed any crime in its acquisition."351,Addis Fortune,12/30/12,Anti-Corruption Commission Launches New Web Portal,,ETHIOPIA (91%); AFRICA (78%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,31-Dec-12,,244 words,CORRUPTION (95%); ETHICS (90%); WEB SITES & PORTALS (90%); ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); COMPUTING & IT REGULATION & POLICY (73%); SEARCH ENGINES (71%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (63%); HOTELS & MOTELS (57%) Ethiopia; Corruption; ICT and Telecom,"The Federal Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission of Ethiopia (FEACC) officially launched its new webportal on December 23, 2012. The webportal was developed by Africom Technology Plc at a cost of 254,000Br. The unveiling took place at the Ghion Hotel in the presence of Ali Suleman, commissioner of the FEACC and Baheru Zeyenu, manager of Africom Technologies Plc. The new webportal will enable the public to have access to information about the Commission and help provide the public with essential sources of information, such as an e-library, online-videos, and publications, according to Ali. FEACC is a dedicated anti-corruption agency, invested with expansive powers to combat corruption in the country. It was established in 2001 in the context of the accelerated internationalisation of anti-corruption law. The mandate of the FEACC is wide, spanning the prevention, investigation and prosecution of all forms of corruption inEthiopia. This is the first part of the e-government plan set to elevate IT and reach citizens with time, power and cost reducing services. Two months ago, the Ministry of Communications & Information Technology (MoCIT) launched 49 e-service portals developed in order to enable seven governmental institutions to give online services. Two private IT solution providers, Africom Tecnologies Plc and eSystem Africa, were involved in developing and installing the e-service system, which cost 3.8 million Br, all provided by the World Bank."353,The Herald (Harare),1/10/13,Massive Corruption Hits Education Sector,,ZIMBABWE (95%),Newspaper,Felex Share,ENGLISH,,,10-Jan-13,,413 words,TEACHING & TEACHERS (93%); CORRUPTION (91%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (90%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (90%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (90%); INTERVIEWS (90%); EMPLOYMENT (89%); EMPLOYMENT SEARCH (78%); RECRUITMENT & HIRING (78%); TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT (78%); LABOR SHORTAGES (78%); TEACHER RECRUITMENT & HIRING (78%); EMPLOYMENT SERVICES (78%); EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES (75%); CULTURE DEPARTMENTS (74%); TEACHER UNIONS (73%); LABOR UNIONS (62%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Education,"MASSIVE corruption has hit the education sector with district education officials reportedly demanding various amounts to interview temporary teachers to fill in vacant posts. The education officials are charging the desperate untrained teachers amounts ranging between US$5 and US$10 as interview fees in addition to the US$5 they charge for application forms. The application forms should be given for free. The situation is rampant in Masvingo, Midlands, and Mashonaland Central. Interviewed untrained teachers yesterday said the officials were also demanding amounts as much as US$300 as kickbacks to secure job placements for the relief teachers or educators seeking transfers to areas with better working conditions. Most of them said they had failed to meet the demands. Education, Sport, Arts and Culture Minister David Coltart yesterday said any official caught charging those amounts would be discharged from duty. ""There is no entitlement for any education official to charge any fees when conducting those interviews,"" he said. ""This is corruption at its highest level and while many people are afraid to report the cases, we urge them to come forward with the names of those officials. Government will not hesitate to dismiss them from duty,"" he said. He said temporary teachers were important to the education sector as they were ""filling a gap."" ""We have got a shortfall of teachers and it does not make sense to drive them away using such corrupt tendencies,"" he said. Zimbabwe has a shortfall of close to 14 000 as it employs about 97 000 teachers against a demand of 111 000. An untrained teacher from Masvingo who recently went for the interviews said he was turned away after failing to pay the U$10 interview fees. ""I am looking for a job to get money but it does not make sense if I am forced to pay money upfront to Government officials,"" he said. ""These officials are not employment agencies who charge certain amounts for us to get employment. More than 100 teachers might apply when the district has less than 20 vacant places."" Another untrained teacher from Murehwa said they were made to buy application forms, which should be given for free. Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe president Mr Takavafira Zhou confirmed receiving such complaints from their members fingering district education officials. Zimbabwe has turned to temporary teachers to fill the huge gap created by the migration of qualified teachers at the height of the country's economic challenges."355,Addis Fortune,1/13/13,World Bank Releases Corruption Survey on Country,,ETHIOPIA (98%); AFRICA (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,14-Jan-13,,577 words,INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (90%); LEASE AGREEMENTS (89%); CITIES (89%); CORRUPTION (89%); LAND USE PLANNING (89%); CITY GOVERNMENT (89%); HOTELS & MOTELS (87%); AGREEMENTS (78%); DEEDS & RECORDINGS (75%); POLLS & SURVEYS (73%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (72%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (71%); RESORTS (69%); NEW CONSTRUCTION (66%); RURAL COMMUNITIES (59%); PRIME MINISTERS (57%) Ethiopia; Land and Rural Issues; Corruption; International Organizations and Africa; Governance,"After dragging its feet so much, and with little back-and-forth with Ethiopian authorities, the World Bank released its much talked about survey on corruption in Ethiopia late last week. The conclusion gives muscle to those inside the administration of Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, who push for surrender in combating its vices, under the guise that Ethiopia is a far better place than many other countries in its league. One of the eight components of the survey is indeed the provision, through leases, and the administration of land. Land claims 40-pages of the total 417 in the survey, with it being identified as an enormously valuable asset, accounting for up to half of national wealth, in a developing country like Ethiopia. Thus, land creates an opportunity for corruption on the part of those with the legal authority to assign, revoke or restrict rights to it, says the survey. This cannot be further from the truth in Ethiopia, gossip observed. Land, particularly urban land, is a battleground between those who have the power to grant and revoke it on the one side, and those who are denied or granted, on the other. This is truer seeing the recent standoff, behind the scenes, between authorities at the Addis Abeba City Administration and two businessmen with a vested interest over plots in an area popularly known as Senga Terra, gossip disclosed. One of the businessmen who could not absorb the daring of city officials to revoke his title deeds for lease is none other than Mohammed Ali Al-Amoudi (Sheikh). A middle ranking official in the administration of Kuma Demekssa, the mayor of Addis Abeba, wrote him a letter announcing the revocation of his lease rights over a plot that has not been utilised for over a decade. Ironically, it is Al-Amoudi's holdings of land, in different parts of the country, which the World Bank survey visibily featured in the section it named, 'Urban Land Speculation in Ethiopia'. The survey identified the Bahir Dar Resort Hotel, the Hora Ras Hotel, a resort hotel planned in Arbaminch town, and the expansion of Sheraton Addis Hotel, as the ones fenced off despite a requirement under the lease law, which states that developers ought to start construction within 18 months of lease agreements being signed. Despite the survey's reluctance to name names, it is abundantly clear that all of these projects point their finger at Al-Amoudi's business empire and its failings, gossip observed. The middle ranking officials in the city administration cited the case of plots remaining idle for over a decade to justify their letter of revocation, on the plot in Senga Terra, and their subsequent threat to do similar on an additional plot in Piazza, according to gossip. Those around the Sheikh claim otherwise, rather pointing to mischief committed in the interest of others, claims gossip. But granted, the letter prompted a fierce protest from Al-Amoudi, who was here a few weeks ago talking to senior officials, including the Prime Minister, gossip learnt. The result is easy to contemplate, claims gossip. Although it is true that the plots have remained fenced off for over a decade now, authorities at the city administration have now quietly retreated from their aggressive demand, displayed a few weeks ago, gossip disclosed. It seems, after all, that Al-Amoudi's MIDROC Ethiopia will continue to enjoy its hold on the plots, and no one in the city administration can do anything about it, gossip disclosed."356,Addis Fortune,1/13/13,Corruption On the Rise - Survey,,ETHIOPIA (94%); UNITED STATES (79%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%); AFRICA (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,14-Jan-13,,1211 words,CORRUPTION (91%); POLLS & SURVEYS (90%); DEVELOPMENT BANKS (90%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (89%); PRIME MINISTERS (89%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (89%); ETHICS (78%); REGULATORY COMPLIANCE (78%); ECONOMIC NEWS (77%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (77%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (75%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (71%); WRITERS (61%); PRESS CONFERENCES (50%); CONSTRUCTION (50%) Ethiopia; Corruption; Banking and Insurance; Legal and Judicial Affairs; International Organizations and Africa; Governance,"Five years in the making and two years later than the scheduled launch time, a survey conducted to gauge the level of corruption in Ethiopia was released last week, by the World Bank. Nonetheless, it falls short of settling a rather lingering debate on whether corruption is getting as bad as many people think, which the nation's anticorruption czars describe as mere 'perception'. Launched on Friday, January 11, 2013, at the Hilton, where Muktar Kedir, minister of Civil Service, under the rank of deputy prime minister, was absent, the survey focuses on eight sectors, compartmentalised as 'new', 'old' and 'service sectors'. A man entrusted by the administration to ensure that the deteriorating governance issue is addressed, Muktar had confirmed his participation at the launch, but cancelled at the last minute, according to a senior official of the Federal Ethics & Anticorruption Commission (FEACC). The launch was not short of state ministers, however, with Ahmed Shide, for Finance & Economic Development, Kebede Gerba, for Water & Energy, and Tollosa Shagi, for Mines. They were all greeted by a rather watered down report that pronounced Ethiopia fares far better, among its peers, when it comes to corruption, for, in many of the sectors surveyed, incidences of corruption were not as pervasive as in ""many developing countries"". It is a survey the World Bank launched five years ago, commissioning a group of 11 researchers, from the United Kingdom, South Africa and the United States, led by Janelle Pliummer, senior governance specialist at the World Bank. Neither Pllummer, nor any of those who took part in the survey, were present at the Hilton last week, when her predecessor, Rupert Bladon, reported the findings in the presence of predominantly anticorruption czars from regional states. ""We've nothing to hide as long as the initiative [by the World Bank] is genuine,"" Meles Zenawi, the late prime minister, was quoted as saying by Ali Sulaiman, commissioner of FEACC, and author of the forword in the book, which was originally meant to be written by the late Prime Minister. The late Prime Minister did have knowledge of its conclusion, though. Long before the survey was completed, eight months ago, the part that deals with the construction sector was used by Meles to defend the records of his government, at a press conference, three years ago. He had argued that corruption in Ethiopia is far less pervasive than many people think it is. The message was no different last week. ""There is big gap between perception and the reality on the ground,"" Ali said. ""The perception is rather high."" He retreated, though, with a disclaimer that his view is not to underestimate the challenges posed by corruption, but instead to reflect on the facts. The facts Ali chose to reflect on come from a series of surveys conducted by institutions, such as; the Addis Abeba University and Kilimanjaro International Plc, which have conducted two national surveys on incidences of corruption. Both concluded that despite the alarming rate of increase in corrupt practices in Ethiopia, there is, however, a perception of it, which is higher than what is evident on the ground. It is confirmed by Transparency International (TI), an international organisation that has published a Corruption Perception Index, since 1995. With 33 points, TI put Ethiopia 113th in its index for 2012, alongside Albania, Niger and Timor. Ali partly blames these international organisations indexing corruption for people having such perceptive attitudes toward corruption. ""These reports are produced by others who have no relationship to the facts on the ground,"" he said last week. But an organisation on the ground, Transparency Ethiopia, had close to 400 people respond, up until January 11, 2013, to a question of whether incidences of corruption are increasing in the last three years; a staggering 84.3pc answered that they were. The survey, released last week, too warns that ""unless confronted, this [corruption] will result in new levels of corruption across the board"". Yet, officials of the World Bank acknowledge that the survey has failed to include other areas perceived to be prone to corruption, such as; tax, customs, state contracts given to private contractors by the state power monopoly, city housing projects, the Railway Corporation and the state owned Metal & Engineering Corporation (MeTEC). Among its areas of scrutiny, the sector picked up as most vulnerable to corruption, the telecom industry, alongside the pharmaceutical sector and the procurement and distribution of drugs for HIV/Aids. Officials from the state owned ethio-telecom dismissed the report as contradictory and out of date. The survey claims ""week accountability and ETC monopoly"" have led to a ""high perception of corruption"". ""Monopoly by itself cannot be the mere cause of corruption,"" Abdurahim Ahmed, public relations head of ethio-telecom, told Fortune. ""The study came out two years after it was completed, there will be many changes in the industry since then."" The construction industry, perceived by the public as the most corrupt, is painted by the Plummer survey as a sector with an extremely complex picture, hence mixed perceptions. Poor implementation of standards and low public sector pay are said to be the causes for corruption. Mining is also another industry that Plummer's findings say is gaining ground in corruption. The risk areas undermining the industry, include; licensing, operations and mining revenue, whilst the absence of policy and regulatory framework in land management deterred regional states from implementing the law in the same way. But this has changed since the time Plummer and her team conducted the survey, according to senior officials of the Commission. They argue that land management is one of the four areas of intense focus in fighting corruption, including; tax and revenues, and the justice system, as well as public procurement and sales. ""It's difficult to say there is high corruption in land administration, since the lease law is in full force,"" an official who asked for anonymity, for he is not authorized to speak to the media, told Fortune. ""We're the main actors in proposing the revision of the law that we hope will address the problem of corruption in this."" In part, they attribute changes, such as this, to the marginal decline other surveys reportedly noted on corruption in Ethiopia. The latest findings by Kilimanjaro International, grades Ethiopia a little above three points out of five, where it showed an improvement for points below one, when compared to the previous national survey. But it is only a mere 8.1pc of those polled, by Transparency Ethiopia, who shared this view; that incidences of corruption have declined. Ethiopia's chief anticorruption czar, Ali, says even this is no reason to be complacent. ""I should not be relaxed,"" Ali said. It was a voice echoed by Justin Y. Lin, the World Bank's country director for Ethiopia, who said his organisation commissioned the study to move the perception to the reality on the ground. Regardless to the result of the survey though, Lin told Ali, and his army of anticorruption officers, that there is no ground for complacence, as the ""incidence of corruption is on the rise""."357,The Namibian (Windhoek),1/14/13,Goabab Guilty On Corruption Charge,,NAMIBIA (93%),Newspaper,Werner Menges,ENGLISH,,,14-Jan-13,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (73%)",720 words,VERDICTS (90%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); SENTENCING (78%); ACQUITTAL (77%); SUPREME COURTS (77%); TESTIMONY (77%); BAIL (73%); ARRESTS (73%); DISMISSALS (71%); WAGES & SALARIES (62%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"FORMER National Assembly Secretary Nama Goabab on Friday became the most senior public official yet to be convicted on a charge under the Anti-Corruption Act of 2004. In a judgement delivered in the High Court in Windhoek, Judge Marlene Tommasi found Goabab guilty on one of the three charges he has been facing in a trial before her since the end of March 2010. A co-accused and former colleague of Goabab (55), National Assembly accountant Abraham George (52), was also found guilty on the same charge on which Goabab was convicted. Goabab was acquitted on the two other charges against him, while George, who faced two counts, was found not guilty on the other charge against him. Goabab and George remain free on bail following the delivery of the verdict. They have to return to court on April 23, when Judge Tommasi is set to start hearing arguments and possibly further evidence before the two men are due to be sentenced. Friday's verdict dashed the hopes Goabab and George might have had of achieving the same success they tasted when Judge Tommasi initially discharged them on the main charges against them in August 2010, after the close of the prosecution's case against them. That discharge was set aside by the Supreme Court in June last year. Goabab stood trial on three main counts of having corruptly used his office or position for gratification, which is an offence under the Anti-Corruption Act. George faced two of those charges. Goabab and George were accused of having illegally rented two vehicles at Government's cost for Goabab's private use during March and April 2007, when he was still the secretary of the National Assembly. The total cost of the vehicle rentals was alleged to have been N$23 552,20, of which N$18 497,20 was actually paid by the National Assembly. Goabab paid an amount of N$18 497,20 back to the National Assembly on June 12 2007, which was four days after his arrest. The first vehicle was rented on March 1 2007 at a discounted government rate, which Goabab would not have been charged if he had rented the car in his private capacity, the prosecution alleged. Goabab alone was also charged with a third count of corruptly using his office or position for gratification, alternatively using a motor vehicle without the owner's consent, in connection with allegations that he had unlawfully used a Government vehicle on May 25 2007 while he was receiving a motor vehicle allowance as part of his salary. On the last charge, Judge Tommasi found that by virtue of his position Goabab had the authority to authorise the use of a Government vehicle. She noted that Goabab, who told the court he used the car to attend a memorial service for a former Cabinet member while his own vehicle was being repaired, had used the car for an official function and only for a short period. A slavish adherence to the public service staff rule that public officials who receive a vehicle allowance may not make use of Government vehicles could have far-reaching consequences for the efficient running of the public service, she remarked. On the charge relating to the vehicle rental on March 1 2007, Judge Tommasi said the court had no reason to disbelieve Goabab when he testified that he intended to repay the costs of that rental to Government. She found that it was not proven beyond reasonable doubt that Goabab and George had rented that car in the name of the National Assembly in order to obtain it at a lower government rate. In that regard she noted that an official who arranged the rental told the court that he secured the preferential rental rate of his own accord, without having been asked by Goabab or George to do so. On the second rental, though, the judge found that Goabab and George had used Government resources to pay a private bill of Goabab. In doing so, Goabab had used his public position to obtain gratification in the form of a loan from Government, she found. Goabab's claim during his testimony that he was not a public officer as defined in the Anti-Corruption Act was dismissed by Judge Tommasi. She found that, as someone who received remuneration from public funds, he indeed was a public officer. Chief Prosecutor Danie Small is representing the state in the trial. Defence lawyer Lucius Murorua is representing Goabab, while George is being represented by Zagrys Grobler."358,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),1/17/13,"Former Permanent Secretary, Three Others Want Corruption Charge Quashed",,ZAMBIA (94%),Newspaper,PERPETUAL SICHIKWENKWE,ENGLISH,,,17-Jan-13,"LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (88%)",340 words,CORRUPTION (91%); MAGISTRATES (90%); INDICTMENTS (90%); LAWYERS (78%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (77%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (72%); ARCHIVE COLLECTIONS (50%) Zambia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"FORMER Information and Broadcasting Services Permanent Secretary Sam Phiri and three others have asked a Lusaka magistrate's court to quash the charge of corrupt acquisition of public property on their indictment claiming there is duplicity of charges. Phiri is jointly charged with former Zambia Daily Mail deputy managing director Davis Mataka, consultant Ngande Mwanajiti and the Zambian Newspaper Limited. The trio is in the first count charged with corrupt acquisition of public property and revenue. The Zambian Newspaper Limited, which is the fourth accused and in person being represented by Mwanajiti, is separately charged with unlawful printing and publication. They were scheduled to take plea before principal resident magistrate Aridah Chuulu yesterday but their defence lawyers applied that the charge be quashed on grounds of duplicity. Phiri's lawyers, Charles Lisita said Section 33 (1) (b) is an offence on its own and Section 33 (2) (b) is also an offence, while Section 33 (3) is another offence on its own. Major Lisita said if the indictment remained in its current form, it would be difficult for the accused persons to defend themselves as the charge was likely to prejudice the trio at trial. But Anti-Corruption Commission senior legal and prosecution officer Muchula Silumesi requested for more time to enable the prosecution adequately respond to the application since the defence had cited a number of authorities. Ms Chulu adjourned the matter to January 18 for the State's response. It is alleged in count one that Phiri, Mataka and Mwanajiti fraudulently diverted K202, 696, 050 Public Media Support Fund from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Services for the production of a newspaper called, ""The Zambian."" In the second count, Mataka alias ""John Allan Mugwida"" and Mwanajiti alias ""George Banda"", unlawfully published a newspaper called ""The Zambian"", which was not registered at the National Archives Department. The offences were committed between January 1, 2011 and November 1, the same year in Lusaka."359,Addis Fortune,1/20/13,Mounting Corruption Risk Poses Momentous Challenge to Economy [opinion],,ETHIOPIA (93%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,21-Jan-13,,1158 words,CORRUPTION (89%); LIBERALISM (73%); PHARMACEUTICALS INDUSTRY (71%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (70%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS (64%) Ethiopia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Corruption is one of the areas where the Ethiopian political sphere deliberates and acts without certainty. The usual dogmatic debate, often supported with meticulous evidence, does not take place. Everything that is said and done is anecdotal. The ruling EPRDF effectively exploits this uncertainty. It often goes on the defensive, saying that all criticisms about the prevalence of corruption are hypothetical and are not reflected on the ground. Strictly speaking, the popular rhetoric goes: there is only a high 'perception' about corruption. Global research on the risk and impact of corruption supports this very rhetoric. Most of the undertaken research could not design and deploy effective methodologies to study the prevalence of corruption within the state structure. Thus, they settle for analysing the mere perceptions of citizens. As rare as it may be, the study disclosed by the World Bank, last week, has brought a milestone change in the debate about corruption inEthiopia. It has elevated the debate to a higher state, for it categorises the whole economy into sectors, and calculates the risk of corruption in each. Its uniqueness stems from its approach of tracing corruption across the value chain of development; from policy making to actual payment. Unlike other research, as if to show its regard for policy, it aligned the risk of corruption with actual developmental undertakings. To the dismay of the ruling EPRDFites, the study has identified a high corruption risk in major economic sectors; from construction to mining. It also states that the risk of corruption in the telecommunications and pharmaceuticals sectors is increasing at an alarming rate. Overall, the survey has shown that corruption, if left on its own, could soon become a real-time developmental challenge forEthiopia. Comparatively, what has been identified by the World Bank's study coincides with earlier studies on corruption perception. If there is one thing that it has done uniquely, it is to ring the alarm bell even louder. And therein lies the debate. For the EPRDFites, the new study is just another alarm bell drawn from perception and institutional gaps. It is only a showcase of the probability of corruption in each of the sectors involved. Though better than the neo-liberal bias of institutions, such as Transparency International (TI), they argue, it is still short of concrete evidence about the prevalence of corruption as a pandemic. Critics seem to agree with the failings of the report. It ought to go beyond analysing risks, to rightly tagging a price on the scourge. It should have tried to measure the developmental impact of the risk, in each of the sectors, the argument goes. If it had done so, they reflect, it would have brought the intensity of the pandemic to light. Beyond the categorised debate, however, the alarm bell of the new study provides the policy sphere with a unique impulse, which, if utilised properly, could clean the burgeoning economy of corrupt practices. Yet, whether this could happen or not, depends largely on the political commitment of the ruling Revolutionary Democrats. If the results of the latest study are anything to go by, the development endeavours of the country are at risk. Failing to take action will affect the very objectives that the EPRDFites advocate. Improved access to basic services, from education to primary health care, remains the foremost evidence of economic development inEthiopia. In addition to this, are improvements in telecommunications penetration, infrastructure expansion and treatment of incurable diseases, such as HIV/Aids. At the base of the looming corruption risk in these sectors is the ever increasing alignment of service provision and governmental investment. Much of the investment in the basic sectors is undertaken by the government. Different tiers of the state apparatus are involved in the value chain of service provisions; from planning to effecting payment. Gaps in the chain risk both public investments and their intended developmental results. Of course, a debate over institutionalisation would not hold water, for the EPRDFites have rightly institutionalised the fight against corruption. They have put in place a corruption watchdog with deployable legal instruments. Where the gap exists is on the attitude towards corruption. By and large, the ruling EPRDFites focus purely on developmental results and provide just marginal attention to the developmental costs of corrupt activities. It is through mainstreaming a change in behaviour that the fight might be as comprehensive as it should be. Institutionalisation could not deliver an end. Creating a policy sphere impermissible to corruption would involve internalisation of the costs of the fight within the costs of the developmental undertakings. But, it cannot happen without accepting the level of risk involved. Despite their legal independence, corruption watchdogs would be energised when supported with visible governmental commitments. This would happen because the policy sphere would be impermissible to corruption and unlawful activities. By extension, this would create a favourable environment for the watchdogs to identify and legally account for malpractices. For a nation where over 85pc of the aggregate economic consumption originates from the government, the risk of corruption cannot be separated from public investment portfolios. Putting in place the right mechanisms to infuse transparency, within the public investment system, will be vital in the fight against corruption. But, it cannot help to reduce the risk without favourable attitudinal change within the implementing bureaucracy. True, highlighting the development results of the past two decades, as the EPRDFites often do, might be important to consolidate enough positive momentum towards envisioned economic aspirations. However, it cannot be sustained if the process is not clean enough. Sustainable economic development, complemented by effective service provisions and inclusive growth, could not be ensured without capable bureaucracy that delivers results. The effectiveness and efficiency of such a bureaucracy cannot be maintained in the long-run unless the operational system is made transparent. For the EPRDFites, doing so would not cost a lot. What would be required is to internalise the threads of the fight against corruption within the policy making regime. Certainly, the past years of institutionalisation would have a lot to offer in these terms. Thus, the stake for the anti-corruption czars and the government is to take the risk analysis, undertaken by the World Bank, one step further. It is indeed high time for the EPRDFites to clear the development path of all corrupt activities and fill the systemic gaps with tailored checks and balances. No doubt that internalisation of the risks is the way forward, in order to complement the speedy economic growth with adequate developmental benefits."361,The Herald (Harare),2/6/13,ZRP to Finalise Corruption Cases,,ZIMBABWE (94%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,7-Feb-13,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (59%)",687 words,CORRUPTION (94%); ARRESTS (90%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (89%); BRIBERY (78%); POLICE MISCONDUCT (78%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Zimbabwe Republic Police has said all cases involving members arrested for dishonest and corruption will now be finalised within seven days as the force ensure that there is a zero tolerance of the scourge.

""In Depot Province, three members were arrested in 2012 for engaging in corrupt activities. These members decided to pursue their own self aggrandised ends and today it is obvious that they are regretting. They lost the whole portion only because of the grains they were craving for,"" Snr Asst Comm Ndebele said. She said if other officers chose to pay a deaf ear to the warnings then they were going to live to regret as no one was going to sympathise with them. Snr Asst Comm Ndebele said the Depot province, as a training institute had always made it clear that all trainers or recruits caught doubling in such activities would be dismissed before they spread the 'disease' to others. ""When we say we don't tolerate corruption we mean that we will deal heavily with those found wanting. Forewarned is forearmed,"" she said. She appealed to the members of the public not to engage in corrupt activities but to work with the police to stop corruption. Snr Asst Comm Ndebele said through their Service Charter, complaints against police were most welcome and the campaign sought to buttress these efforts. She said suggestion boxes were also ideal and identities of informers would be protected. ""Those bent on bribing the police to get away with crime will also, together with the disgracing police officers, face the full wrath of the law,"" she said. She said the recruits they were sending to other police provinces countrywide were well knowledgeable, well trained officers whose future in the force was bright. ""We therefore call upon you to help these new members nurture the seeds we have sown here so that we promote faithfulness and honesty in our organisation,"" Snr Asst Comm Ndebele said. She said the country was looking for patriotic and selfless minds while the force was seeking incorruptible, loyal and honesty officers. She said their campaign had came at a time when the force had wedged a spirited war against corruption which had dealt immeasurable damage to political, social and economic life in the country. ""This campaign is therefore a great stride towards bringing justice, lawfulness and a spirit of selflessness, to our police officers while imploring the general public to avoid networking in corruption but rather report all forms so that this cancer is weeded off at the earliest possible time. ""Police officers are the vanguards of law and order and they should be honest so that the nation benefits a full measure of police services,"" Snr Asst Comm Ndebele said. She said President Mugabe was on record condemning corruption and other anti-social behaviours as he sought to cultivate and promote a sovereign nation that was well-defined by uprightness and lawfulness. Snr Asst Comm Ndebele said, ""This noble call therefore places demand on our part to take heed from His Excellency and promote behaviour that is conducive for nation building."" She said Depot province was a training institute tasked to transform civilians into professional, patriotic and committed police officers whose skills, attitudes and knowledge should be congruent with the needs of policing environment. Snr Asst Comm Ndebele applauded Commissioner-General Augustine Chihuri for sounding an eloquent call to officers to shun corruption and deliver professionalism and justice through fair application of the law. Acting Depot police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Miriam Kapfumvuti said the role of the police and public relations duties were premised on bridging the gap between the force and the public through spearheading community policing initiatives."362,The Herald (Harare),2/6/13,Corruption: Crime Against Humanity [column],,ZIMBABWE (92%); AFRICA (91%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%),Newspaper,Reason Wafawarova,ENGLISH,,,7-Feb-13,,1892 words,RELIGION (89%); CORRUPTION (89%); TESTIMONY (78%); HAIR LOSS (68%); CHARITIES (67%); PRESS CONFERENCES (61%) Zimbabwe; Corruption,"One of the saddest lessons of history is that when we have been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozled. It is not easy to believe that you have been taken for a ride. To believe so is a direct attack on your credibility, and an assault on your ego. This is why it is easy to say God's works are inexplicable whenever we get questioned over any likelihood that we could be victims of deception -- albeit in the name of the Most High. When we are reminded to try and distinguish between fantasies and miracles sometimes we get agitated and we accuse those asking us of being vessels of the evil one. If rationality threatens our integrity and our spiritualised egos we chose irrationality in the name of faith in God. We find ourselves no longer interested in finding out the truth. This is because the bamboozled would have captured us. It's simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we have been taken in. In religion once you give an overzealous novice power and unlimited control over you, you almost certainly won't be able to regain any of it. You become a victim of deception, indoctrination and manipulation. This is precisely why youthful charismatic preachers can easily pass on their boyhood fantasies for God's miracles and they get cheered for the fiction. We have this raucous cheering of unverified and unverifiable miracles that has gripped many of the African nations, and the hoopla has reached catastrophic levels, if the confusion in Zimbabwe s anything to go by. We hear of performer-narrated ""miracles"" of cash being created from thin air, gold falling from heaven, hair miraculously growing on balding heads, fat people becoming super skinny instantly, teeth emerging from bare gums; and we must believe all this without any form of evidence or verification whatsoever, or else we are accused of trying to limit God's ability to perform signs and wonders. The miracle performers are audacious enough to host Press conferences without any of the beneficiaries of the testified miracles as exhibits, and without the gold that supposedly ""rained"" from the heavens, and we still are expected to elevate these fanciful stories to levels of bona fide miracles. As Kurt Vonnegut wrote in the book ""A man without a Country"", ""No matter how corrupt, greedy, and heartless our government, our corporations, our media, and our religious and charitable institutions may become, the music will still be wonderful."" Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back. That is a simple sad piece of political logic. Even spiritual charlatans in religious circles are just as predatory. Sub-Saharan Africa is rated the most underdeveloped and most corrupt region in the world today. We have some amazing government priorities as the region stands out as the top market for luxurious vehicles like Mercedes limousines or Range Rovers, all in the midst of unprecedented poverty. The people who make the decisions to purchase these obscene vehicles preside over the world's worst poverty levels ever, and they see absolutely nothing untoward in their conduct. Corruption can be defined as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain, both in the private and public sector, and sadly in religion too. Essentially corruption is all about taking advantage of a people's trust and faith - manipulating that trust and faith for private and selfish gain. Politicians egregiously do it, religious leaders do it too, and so do other social leaders. Always the victim is the vulnerable of society. The prevalence of bribery has assumed cultural levels in countries like South Africa and Zimbabwe where public officials openly solicit for bribes, embezzlement of public funds has become fashionable and admirable, and kickbacks in the public procurement system have assumed official status. The anti-corruption efforts in sub-Saharan Africa are unquestionably cosmetic - and this explains why the MDC-T can fire an entire urban council on grounds of ""proven acts of corruption,"" and the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission finds no logical reason to be involved any way. The Corruption Perception Index for Africa in 2010 showed Somalia, Chad, Burundi, Angola and Equatorial Guinea to be the top most corrupt countries in Africa, and the statics had an absolute benign effect on the politics of those countries. The bamboozled masses could not lift a finger to have the situation corrected, and the perpetrating politicians continued the mess unabated. The implicit cost of corruption is that it transforms itself into a regressive tax that takes a toll on services that the poor cannot afford. It is the poor that end up going without education, healthcare, clean water, infrastructure, food or shelter. Corruption is Africa's greatest implicit killer, and it accounts for the death of thousands of children each and every day. It is estimated that diarrhoea alone kills about 2000 children every single day, and that disease is 100percent poverty related. Corruption hits worst on the vulnerable and the poor of society and as such it must be treated as a crime against humanity. Corrupt officials are implicit mass murderers and must be treated as such. Those among our people who choose the route of corruption must be reminded that corruption deviates funds intended for development, undermines government's ability to provide basic services, undermines the rule of law, promotes inequality and injustice, and makes the country unfriendly to investment. Corruption is a full package of destruction. The vociferous noise against corruption that used to be the character of MDC politicians has dramatically died down in the last four years, not exactly because corruption in Zimbabwe has declined by any measure, but precisely because our erstwhile anti-corruption advocates have joined government and suddenly began to understand the logic and nobility of corruption. We are caught up in this pitiful predicament where political office has become a platform for self-aggrandisement, and our people have resigned to the reality that in Africa politics is about taking your turn to loot, to practice nepotism, and to take advantage of your subordinates and those to whom you are supposed to offer service. The rot is as bad as to normalise sexual abuse by public officials against their female subordinates, with sad cases of some females seemingly taking it as acceptable. The lack of transparency, integrity and accountability in Africa's governance systems is the major cause of the continent's retardation in development. There are a lot of hidden costs that corruption brings to a nation. A corrupt system breeds poor performance in the civil service for example. A good example is when a staffing officer in the education sector demands bribes from teachers so they can be deployed at better stations. Many remote areas in Africa have been deprived of quality education because only those teachers who cannot pay bribes get deployed there, and sometimes there are acute cases of understaffing in these areas. The net cost for this are scores of children deprived of quality education, and having their academic potential completely wasted alongside their entire future and destiny. These children are essentially condemned to an adulthood of hopelessness. When corruption is allowed to flourish unabated it does not only erode the prospect of development. More dangerously it deeply weakens the legislature and the judiciary. A legislature comprising of corrupt wretches is corrupt by definition, and it is so weakened that a country can easily become incapacitated in its ability to combat the scourge corruption. It suddenly appears like nobody has the power to stop corruption. Equally a judiciary run by judges and magistrates that solicit or accept bribes is not worthy the name judiciary, and it destroys completely the essence of the rule of law, making bribes look as innocent as weddings. We have in many African countries this sorry status where law enforcement is not only compromised but almost totally ineffective. This in itself is not a cause of corruption but a result of it, and without the willpower to enforce laws a country is simply ungovernable. The main reason Africa's accountability institutions are dysfunctional is the rampant prevalence of political patronage. Patronage is the tool used by power hungry tyrants to retain power. All that has to happen is for the leader to turn a blind eye to acts of corruption so he can wield these same acts as a blackmailing tool whenever he needs to control those who carried them out. In the end everyone owes their political existence to the one who wields the power. Political patronage erodes independence and professionalism in both the public and the private sectors. Even in the churches we now have church founders that basically surround themselves with pliant junior pastors who will not question any action from the founder member. This is precisely why church funds count for the most unaccounted for money in the world today. There is almost one billion dollars deposited in US banks every Monday from the churches in that country. There are no corresponding church assets that can explain satisfactorily where this money is going. Surely Zimbabwean banks must be pretty busy on Mondays too, hopefully with church money being deposited into church accounts, not the leaders' personal accounts. What lacks most at the moment is the means to bring perpetrators of corruption to account. Meanwhile the vulnerable and the poor continue to be deprived of basic necessities to life, and the continent of Africa suffers so much poverty that lives are unnecessarily lost as children succumb to famines and starvation, while the adult population dies from easily preventable and curable diseases. The highest obligation of patriotism is to fight corruption in both the public and the private sector. Corruption is murderous and ruinous to mankind, especially to the vulnerable and the poor. It is a crime against humanity and must be treated as such by everyone with a sense of decency. We must all tremble with indignation at every instance of corruption. Zimbabwe is heading for elections this year and people are faced with two choices, voting out the corrupt or voting in the rhetoric sold to us by the eloquent voice of the politician. We can make a bold statement as a nation, and through our vote we must. We have known urban councils that have institutionalised corruption to unprecedented standards, and the controlling political party for such councils still hopes to have its candidates retained, or to have a new set of the corrupt lot voted in. Harare, Bulawayo, Masvingo, Mutare and Chitungwiza councils are all controlled by the MDC-T and never in the history of these councils has so much corruption been seen as evidenced in the last four years. This is not to say Zimbabwe's corruption is limited only to local government. Far be it from this writer that we exonerate the endemic corruption in central government, or that we sanitise the tattered image of executive. The electorate must know how to wield the axe on corruption; otherwise we all become complicit to this gigantic crime. Zimbabwe we are one and together we will overcome. It is homeland or death!

Recent media reports stated that Kwangali residents had complained to Pohamba over a drawn-out court challenge of land allocations by Mpasi and also over the chief's alleged unilateral appointments to the traditional authority. The chairperson of the UTA chiefs' council, Joseph Kandjimi, yesterday issued a statement in which he said the complainants are members of an ""illegal, self-righteous and interfering gang"", which he called the ""Ukwangali Traditional Anti-Corruption Advisers"" or Utaca. Kandjimi said this group had been campaigning and instigating people against Mpasi with the aim to dethrone him and to install their own 'hompa', adding that these people were hampering economic development, which is what they accused Mpasi of. Some of the unhappy people have been expelled from the UTA because of their ""unbecoming behaviour, disobedience and insubordination"" to Mpasi and for their alleged inability to advance the course of the UTA. ""They will try anything as long as they live to destroy the UTA by character assassination,"" Kandjimi said, adding that while the traditional authority has been lenient with regard to the freedom of expression of its detractors, such freedoms do have limits. The spokesperson of the disgruntled group, Andreas Muporosi Kamukwanyama, was quoted as having said that Mpasi had stopped community meetings in Kwangali, and only invited his favourite councillors and headmen when he held meetings. Kandjimi hit out at Kamukwanyama, accusing him of having lost a lot of the UTA's money while he was in charge of its finances. Mpasi made headlines last year when he admitted to having received a Land Cruiser from Ohangwena Governor Uusko Nghaamwa some years ago after he had given him two pieces of land on Kwangali communal land. He also admitted having given portions of communal land to high-ranking government officials, which pitted him against his subjects who felt that he was only catering to the whims of the rich, at the expense of the poor."365,The New Times (Kigali),2/13/13,Judiciary Sacks Ten Over Corruption,,RWANDA (92%),Newspaper,Laurent Kamana and Edwin Musoni,ENGLISH,,,13-Feb-13,"KIGALI, RWANDA (76%)",276 words,CORRUPTION (95%); JUDGES (91%); SUPREME COURTS (90%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); SENTENCING (78%); DISMISSALS (78%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (78%); PRESS CONFERENCES (57%) Rwanda; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Ten justice personnel - judges and court clerks - were sacked over corruption related practices during the past two years. In 2011, seven judicial practitioners were charged with corruption while three were charged last year. The Chief Justice, Prof. Sam Rugege, made the announcement during a news conference on Monday at the Supreme Court in Kigali. The same event also marked the launch of the anti-corruption week. ""Corruption cases among judicial practitioners have been reported mainly in lower courts. We had one case of a High Court judge in Musanze, but, so far, we do not have any corruption case involving a staff in the Supreme Court,"" the Chief Justice said. He also dismissed claims that corruption among the court officials may possibly be a result of low pay, saying that most of the cases arrested include people who are soliciting for as little as Rwf30,000. ""But we can confidently say that cases of corruption have tremendously reduced although some of our staff may still be involved in the vice,"" said Rugege. He attributed the decrease in corruption figures to the tight measures against the culprits, including dismissals. The Chief Justice also condemned judges who render lenient sentences to judicial practitioners convicted of corruption. This is the third time the Judiciary is marking the anti-corruption week, dedicated to fight corruption related deeds y. It's held on an annual basis. During the course of the week, about 40 cases will be tried in various courts across the country.

The Chief Justice, Sam Rugege, made the remark while closing the anti-corruption week at the weekend. The ceremony was preceded by a march across the city streets. Rugege said the week has been an important initiative due to the activities that courts across the country engaged in. ""Given the willingness and capacity to handle corruption-related cases in this week [last week] as well as the sensitisation campaigns against corruption, I am sure that this week plays a significant role in educating not only legal practitioners, but also the general public on the negative effects of this practice,"" Rugege said. The anti-corruption week started on February 11. During the period, awareness activities were carried out at sector level, in secondary schools and prisons, among others. The media was also used to offer information, especially through corruption-related programmes over radio stations, which gave the public opportunity to contribute during call-ins. Between 2009 and 2011, 43 out of 83 corruption cases were cleared. Although officials could not give the exact figure of corruption-related cases for last year, sources indicate most corruption cases relate to breaching of tendering procedures. Rugege called on judges to ensure expeditious handling of corruption-related cases; urging that it is sometimes a challenge as some of those accused are not detained therefore complicating the exercise. ""Coming up with this kind of initiative (Supreme Court Anti-corruption Week) does not mean things are completely fine or that there is too much corruption in courts, but it's a preventive measure against any party that may want to distort the image of our judicial system,"" the Chief Justice said."367,The Namibian (Windhoek),2/20/13,Walvis Bay Traffic Cop Not Guilty of Corruption,,NAMIBIA (79%),Newspaper,Adam Hartman,ENGLISH,,,20-Feb-13,,140 words,CORRUPTION (91%); VERDICTS (90%); MAGISTRATES (90%); ACQUITTAL (90%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (88%); BAIL (72%); ARRESTS (72%) Namibia; Corruption,"WALVIS Bay traffic officer Collin Rickets was found not guilty of corruption in the Walvis Bay Magistrate's Court last week.

He was arrested on October 6 2011 and was granted bail of N$1 000. He was suspended from his duties until February 20 2012, when he was reinstated. An internal hearing scheduled at the municipality is expected to be cancelled after last week's verdict.

Whereas the ruling party sailed through the troubled waters of uncertainty relatively unscathed, the opposition parties stood in the midst of it with utter indifference. The public, mourning the death of the late Prime Minister, predominantly positioned themselves alongside the EPRDFites. To the astonishment of the world and, of course, the many 'nay' sayers, the political space remained as consolidated as it was under Meles. No significant tide arose. The same is true also in the policy sphere. There was no major shift in attitude amongst the key players, ranging from facilitators, such as consultants, to bilateral and multilateral donors and financers. This was mainly due to the smooth transition of power put in place by the EPRDFites. They effectively contained the conflict of interests and allowed governmental undertakings to proceed smoothly. Yet, there were some fronts that felt the uncertainty more so than others. These included the usual suspects of land administration and taxes, and new frontiers, such as foreign exchange. There were efforts by various players to hedge risks emerging from the political uncertainty, by exploiting gaps in the policy sphere, the market and the regulatory framework. Although the risks were avoided, through the peaceful transition of power and the solid standing of the ruling party, the general risk of corruption has continued to rise at an even faster rate than previously. It is now reaching a level where corruption is simply becoming systematic. With the EPRDFites scheduled to embark on their first general convention meeting since the death of Meles - their prime crafter and drafter of economic, social and political policy stances - the fight against shortcuts, corruption and poor public service delivery has once again taken centre stage. It has indeed become an agenda that will determine their political future and rank their level of achievement in the eyes of the electorate, which has given them the mandate to govern up until 2014. The convention, which will be held in Bahir Dar, the capital of Amhara Region and a mainstay of one of the largest member parties of the ruling coalition, the Amhara National Democratic Movement (ANDM), is expected to bring the rank and files of the bureaucracy under one roof. As scheduled, the convention will focus on political and organisational issues, economic and social development, as well as good governance and democracy. The congress will be held at a time when the national economy is witnessing yet another year of strong growth, and it would be well positioned to deliberate on development. Since the Party is vested with the power to lead the nation, the discussion could bring positive externalities to the whole policy sphere. Special emphasis will be given to the policies proposed to fight inflation, tame inequality, reduce unemployment and resolve essential commodity supply constraints. More than that, however, there is a huge expectation as to the policy measures that may arise in the good governance and service provision frontiers. If public opinion is anything to go by, that is where the core of popular interest in the convention lies. Indeed, good governance and quality public service delivery have been the most disputed issues during the entire 21-year reign of the EPRDFites. It has been a frontier that has, at times, even been known to put Meles on the defensive. Partly, the problem is connected to the nature of the bureaucracy inherited by the EPRDFites. When coming to power in 1991, they took over a bureaucracy that was shattered by socialist indoctrination, momentous inefficiency, poor service culture and parochialism. It took a series of reforms to break the bureaucracy's cultural cycle, which was unfit for a capitalist system of any description. Instilling a system that fits the statist capitalism that the Revolutionary Democrats subscribed to, however, was an equivalent challenge. With the establishment of such a bureaucracy came new challenges, ranging from poor service provision to corrupt practices. As a result, all of the subsequent reforms were aimed at solving such pertinent challenges. Despite the reforms, however, the challenges remained. With each passing day, they continue to grow too big to be solved with quick fixes. Untamed, there is the real possibility that they may eventually become systemic. It is the fight against such a growing tide of public disenfranchisement, driven by corrupt public servants and subpar public services, which the EPRDFites are faced with at this round of their major convention. Science, including the latest research by academics and renowned institutions, such as the World Bank (WB), stands firmly against them. Outcomes from researchers show that both the perception and reality of corruption in Ethiopia are increasing. The presence of the practice, throughout the sectors, is also rapidly becoming evenly distributed. As if to worsen the case for the ruling Revolutionary Democrats, the researches, especially the latest study by the WB, show that the epidemic has diffused itself into the very pillars of the development, which has been achieved throughout the last two decades. Certainly, the convening EPRDFites stand at a crossroads. They would like to build a bureaucracy that is capable of delivering development results, but too they must ensure that it is clean of corrupt practices. It is not that they are short of declarations. It has been years since their policy radar shifted to create a society that abhors corruption. Nevertheless, their political commitment in the fight against corruption has fallen short. Their approach lacks integration and inclusiveness, and has been unfairly lopsided towards prevention. It seems that it is now time for them to put in place effective strategies to prevent and fight the very epidemic that continues to make the lives of citizens worse. Their convention has to help initiate the necessary momentum towards a clean bureaucracy with the mentality to serve. There is no more urgent task besides fighting corruption, in all ways possible, and solidifying the growth momentum of the economy. Furthermore, there is no political player more responsible to do so than a ruling party with the public mandate to govern. Furthering the lip service towards the fight against corruption with inaction will risk the future of the nation. It is indeed time for the EPRDFites to act, in order to avoid any more complacency, with regards to corruption and poor public services."369,New Democrat (Monrovia),2/25/13,"In the War Against Corruption, When the General Cries, What the Foot Soldiers Do?

Frances Johnson-Allison, our army general in the onslaught against graft. The tearful portrait of irresistible corruption by the Chair of the government anti-graft agency, LACC, demands that all Liberians must seriously introspect on the problem and suggest plausible solutions. In fact, the LACC chair, speaking in apparent frustration about how corruption has disgustingly permeated the Liberian society, considers shifting focus from adults to children in the war against corruption. Her cries: The more corruption is fought among adults, the more they get drowned in it. Saying adult circles are saturated with corruption, the Counselor suggests, perhaps, a revolution against graft--a revolution that will produce a new generation focused on living and practicing the virtues of honesty and transparency and not the vices of dishonesty and corruption. For children, she believes it will be a revolution of sensitizing them about the dangers of dishonesty and graft. These are telling statements by a renowned jurist, who, on previous occasions, served as chair of the National Elections Commission, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Justice Minister & Attorney General of Liberia and minister of Commerce & Industry. Her declarations about our country add to other cues sought by the international community to evaluate transparency here. A decent suggestion. But the children deemed as focus of the revolution are regrettably not living in utopia, but associating with parents and other adults most likely with hands in the corruption pot. Perhaps such association makes many pupils to often proudly declare to schoolmates without shame: ""Among my mother's children, I love myself the best; if my belly is filled, I don't care for the rest."" Though simply mooted off the cuff, we suggest that stakeholders in such proposed revolution begin with disabusing the mindset of children who think cheating is the right way in life. Hindsight about corruption since Liberia was declared on 26 July 1847 obliges all Liberians as foot soldiers not to desert the LACC--our general in the fight--but march with fortitude against the common enemy. When William Tolbert became president after serving 19 years as vice president under President William VS Tolbert, he wanted to immediately annihilate for corruption that permeated government circles and society at large. So, he established the National Force for the Eradication of Corruption (NFEC). But corruption outlived the NFEC so much that young AFL soldiers who overthrew Tolbert's regime in 1980 accused it not only of corruption, but ""rampant corruption"". SCOGO, the forerunner of GSA, was established to fight in government procurement, just as the General Auditing Commission, LACC, the PPCC and criminal courts have a similar objective. Nevertheless their existence, the menace the menace remains a major threat to economic growth and development. Soon on his second day in power, Master-sergeant Samuel Doe, made the following independent statement during his visit at Central High School in Buzzi Quarters: ""There are some people...when they receive 25 loaves of bread for their students, they eat 15 and only 10 reach to the students. That is rampant corruption...anyone found doing that will not live to tell the story"". Soon 'you will not live to tell the story' became a household expression in Liberia. As the crackdown waned with time while the junta enjoyed the paraphernalia of power, Doe publicly declared: ""Corruption cannot be completely eradicated, but can only be minimized."" Therefore, it became an irony that he later perished in a gorilla rebellion whose masterminds accused him of being a dictator engaged in rampant corruption. A new Pandora Box opened when Mr. Charles Taylor, who schemed the removal of Doe, became president and reportedly made his private residence the custodian of the national treasury. So, see how corruption is alive with us even after President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf declared it as ""public enemy number one"" during her first inaugural speech seven years ago. Cllr. Johnson-Allison is in tears that all mechanisms put in place to fight corruption are failing to kill it, and suggests that children be targeted in a revolution against graft. But we still feel that many corruption cases have remained untried and defendants in the few that handed down guilty verdicts were not dealt harshly by demanding restitution or confiscation of property for monies stolen. This aspect is necessary while we prepare for the revolution."370,New Democrat (Monrovia),2/26/13,Ellen Struggles With Corruption,,TUNISIA (92%); LIBERIA (92%); AFRICA (88%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,26-Feb-13,"TUNIS, TUNISIA (92%)",392 words,CORRUPTION (91%); EXECUTIVES (79%); POLITICS (79%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); DEVELOPMENT BANKS (76%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (73%); CIVIL SERVICES (73%); BOARDS OF DIRECTORS (72%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (71%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (70%); FREEDOM OF INFORMATION (50%) Liberia; Corruption,"President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf has admitted that her government is still struggling to control corruption despite affirmation that necessary mechanisms have been put in place to deal with this vice. ""We continue to struggle with corruption,"" she told the Board of Executive Directors at the First Replenishment Meeting for ADF-13 recently at the temporary headquarters of the African Development Bank in Tunis, Tunisia. Corruption has become a daunting challenge for this government despite the reinforcement and mobilization of mechanisms like the anti-graft agency, LACC, the ministry of justice and judicial system to intensify the fight against it, stunning President Sirleaf to often admit that what is now left is enforcing punishment for corruption. Persistent corruption has permeated all sectors of the Liberian society, undermining full utilization of proceeds from its vast mineral wealth to accelerate national development. Opposition politicians and cadets of the ruling Unity Party are unanimous in critiques of the President for not still doing enough to discourage corruption. The Chair of the LACC, Cllr. Frances Johnson-Allison once accused the President of having no political will go fight corruption. But President Sirleaf reiterated in Tunis: ""We continue to struggle with corruption. I have to say that to you because it's been so embedded over too long a period of deprivation that we have had to look at it in a total context of detection and prevention."" To prevent corruption, she said, ""You've got to give people a decent wage to reduce their vulnerabilities; the installation of systems to make sure that, through automation, you can minimize the chances of personal discretion and abuse; to build the laws that protect people, like the Freedom of Information Act, our Public Financial Management Act, and new procurement laws."" On prevention, she said her government has done ""very well"" but acknowledged that it will take a judiciary with integrity to assist in the area of punishing perpetrators of corruption. ""The punishment side is where you have to have a judicial system that has the integrity and the capacity; and we continue to struggle with that. All of those are in place. And then the capacity, with bloated civil servants who really do not have the capacity to understand the laws, which makes it difficult,"" she said."371,The New Times (Kigali),3/6/13,HIV/Aids Coordinator Named in Corruption Case,,RWANDA (79%),Newspaper,Edwin Musoni,ENGLISH,,,7-Mar-13,,387 words,AIDS & HIV (93%); EXTORTION (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); AGREEMENTS (68%) Rwanda; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"The associations and cooperatives of people living with HIV/Aids in Burera district have lodged a complaint over alleged extortion by a local leader. The associations claim that Jean de Dieu Muzerwa, who is in-charge of coordinating activities of people living with HIV/Aids at the district level extorted about Rwf1.9m from eight associations and cooperatives that received money from Global Fund for the welfare of their members. Last year, 12 associations in Burera received close to Rwf20 million meant to be invested in agriculture to improve the welfare of people living with HIV/Aids. But Mwizerwa instructed each of the benefiting associations to give him 10 per cent of the money. ""By the time we learnt about it, eight associations had already given him the money. We tried to convince him to pay back the money but he refused claiming that there was no proof that he received the money,"" said Jean De Dieu Twagiramungu, the coordination of associations of people living with HIV/Aids in Burera district. Twagiramungu, who was speaking at a news briefing organised by the Ministry of Health said the accused later refunded money to four associations out of the eight. The extortion claims came to the limelight after an anonymous person sent an e-mail to the Minister of Health, Dr Agnes Binagwaho, informing her about the malpractice and requesting that the issue be looked into. ""We can't verify whether this information is true or not, but these people have a right to question any leader since they are the ones that elected them to office,"" Dr Binagwaho said while responding to the claims, yesterday. ""As the ministry, we are just facilitating them to exercise their rights. Upon receiving the complaint, we forwarded it to the relevant authorities for action,"" she said. However, when The New Times contacted Mwizerwa, he admitted receiving the money from the associations, but denied that it was extortion. ""There was an emergency call for associations to draft project proposals, I assisted them with getting an expert that would do that for them on condition that every association would pay 10 per cent of the money they will receive, but this was a verbal agreement,"" Mwizerwa said. This newspaper has since learnt that Burera district has suspended Mwizerwa as investigations into the matter are still going on."372,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),3/8/13,"Police, RTSA Top Corruption Index",,ZAMBIA (96%),Newspaper,Kaiko Namusa,ENGLISH,,,8-Mar-13,"LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (88%)",441 words,CORRUPTION (93%); BRIBERY (91%); POLICE FORCES (90%); RANKINGS (87%); AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS (78%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (78%); ROAD TRANSPORTATION SAFETY (78%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (73%); PASSPORTS & VISAS (69%); IMMIGRATION (69%) Zambia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE Zambia Police Service and the Road Transport and Safety Agency (RTSA) are leading public institutions in corruption, the latest Zambia Bribe Payers Index (ZBPI) has revealed. The 2012 Index report which was released in Lusaka yesterday ranks the two institutions in first and second places respectively on the 16-log index which has the Patent and Companies Registration Office (PACRA) as the least institution involving bribery cases. Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) released the report. Public institutions that followed were the Ministry of Health, the National Registration Office, Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, the Zambia Revenue Authority, Zesco, the judiciary (courts), passport office and local authorities. Others were the Ministry of Education, the Immigration Department, the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, the Ministry of Communication, Works, Transport and Supply, ZAMTEL and PACRA on the tail. A summary of the findings revealed that the overall aggregate bribery score had reduced from 14 per cent in 2009 to 9.8 per cent in 2012. TIZ president Lee Habasonda said while it was disappointing that the police still ranked number one as the most corrupt institution, it was gratifying to note that they were the most improved in terms of reduction of bribery institution. Mr Habasonda said it was disappointing that RTSA had moved up the ladder in terms of corruption to rank second. In 2009 RTSA was ranked fourth, the Ministry of Health was ranked sixth, while the National Registration Office was ranked second, the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources was third. ""We have, however, noted that the more an institution relates or has an interface with the general public, the more likely they are to be reported as corrupt and while this is acknowledged, these indicators, as contained in the 2012 ZBPI, are a source of concern,"" he said. The report also made a comparison between President Michael Sata's Government in the fight against corruption with that of late President Levy Mwanawasa, in which it stated that the current Government exhibited less seriousness but that there was room for improvement. But compared to former President Rupiah Banda's administration, the PF Government was performing better. ""We implore the PF Government to take this report with humility, good faith and goodwill for the betterment of their own record as a Government in the fight against corruption,"" he said. Secretary to the Cabinet Rowland Msiska in a speech read for him by Permanent Secretary for administration, Anna Mwewa, said information generated from the survey was helpful in understanding the supply side of corruption ."373,The Herald (Harare),3/13/13,Police Urged to Resist Corruption,,ZIMBABWE (94%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,13-Mar-13,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (90%)",257 words,CORRUPTION (90%); AIDS & HIV (88%); ETHICS (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (77%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (73%); EPIDEMICS (71%); STUDENT DISCIPLINE (65%); VIRUSES (51%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Police have been challenged to shun corruption and participate in the country's economic turnaround programmes in line with the country's empowerment policies.

Political observers say ZACC's ""deafening"" silence on MDC ministers, the Prime Minister's double-dipping scandal, and documented corruption in MDC-T-led local authorities pointed to political manoeuvring by ZACC to abet the MDC-T cause ahead of elections. Although corruption could never be condoned, the analysts said, ZACC's selective investigation of one side of Government just three months shy of scheduled polls could only be interpreted as aimed at bolstering the MDC-T's waning fortunes. Despite suffering legal losses recently, ZACC insists on securing warrants to search the offices of Mines and Mining Development Minister Obert Mpofu, Transport, Communications and Infrastructural Development Minister Nicholas Goche, and Youth, Indigenisation and Empowerment Minister Saviour Kasukuwere. Sources close to developments at Harvest House say these three ministries, along with the Local Government, Rural and Urban Development Ministry and all State enterprises under them were identified by the MDC-T as integral to the Zanu-PF campaign and message. Midlands State University lecturer Dr Nhamo Mhiripiri yesterday said the ZACC was supposed to be driven by national interests when executing its constitutional mandate. He said the commission should explain to Zimbabweans the methodology it was using that made it exclusively target Zanu-PF officials in Government. ""We need not condone corruption as a country. Before elections we need to scrutinise everyone to see if they are fit to occupy public office. However, this should not be subjected to people from one political party only because it undermines that party ahead of polls. ""The Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission should tell the country if its whistle blowers are sending information against Zanu-PF only. They should convincingly tell the country on how they come to act on complaints they are receiving from people. That methodology should be explained so that the people know the net is getting everyone who is corrupt. The people should not be discredited without some facts,"" he said. Dr Mhiripiri said Zanu-PF had the right to complain against the perceived selective investigations being carried out by the commission. Political analyst and Zanu-PF politburo member Professor Jonathan Moyo said ZACC's operations were not beyond reproach. Prof Moyo said the blitz on mainly Zanu-PF ministers in Government sparked outrage because the commission was abusing its office to score political points for the MDC formations in Government. ""The commission has done nothing on corruption by some MDC councils, some of which have even been fired by their party for abusing office. They did nothing on fraud involving US$1,5 million meant for the Prime Minister's house. ""There is nothing that was done involving the US$20 million special drawing rights by the Ministry of Finance deposited (with a local bank) without accruing interest that later disappeared. ""They also did not do anything on the looting of diamonds in Marange by ACR, yet they are interested in investigating the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation, going back to the period when ACR was still operating in Chiadzwa,"" he said. Prof Moyo said ZACC was set up in 2000, but argued that the current board leading the commission's lifespan was over because it was set up by the GPA parties. He said there was no need for the board to remain in office. ""The commission is going after these three Zanu-PF ministers 100 days before elections because they want to damage the mainstay of Zanu-PF's empowerment programmes and benefit the MDC-T that has done nothing over the past four years it has been in Government. They have no manifestos,"" he said. He said some of the parastatals being targeted such as the Zimbabwe National Road Administration had done ""tremendous"" work in rehabilitating the country's major roads. Political analyst and women rights crusader Dr Margaret Dongo said ZACC should conduct its business in a manner that does not raise suspicion. She said corruption was rampant among church members, political parties and business institutions. ""Corruption enjoys no colour, creed or belief. There are corrupt people in Zanu-PF and MDC formations - everywhere, there is corruption. If you target one party, in a way you are telling the other party to continue looting national coffers because you will not touch them. The fight against corruption should not take a partisan approach,"" she said. Another political observer Dr Eldred Masunungure said not only Zanu-PF was disturbed by the operations of the ZACC, but other stakeholders were also dissatisfied. ""This shows some internal inadequacies of the ZACC. They are not enjoying adequate autonomy hence they are vulnerable to political and business pressures as well as international forces. Being accused of corruption damages one's reputation and ZACC should exercise extreme caution when dealing with these matters. ""ZACC should be revamped, strengthened at policy making level and the implementers should be professional enough . . . This is a sensitive area and they should be cautious in the way they conduct themselves,"" he said."375,New Democrat (Monrovia),4/1/13,Judges Blamed for Corruption,,LIBERIA (94%),Newspaper,Peter N.

I'm not saying at an intermediary level there are no problems or at the level of the Supreme Court; but the bulk of the problems faced by the judiciary is from the level of the magisterial courts. So, we need to pay more attention to them"", he pointed out. The Interim Chief Justice made the statement at the end of a three-day Criminal Justice Conference where serious problems facing the criminal justice system were discussed. Chief Justice Korkpor also said the issue of bond fees collected by Judges of Magisterial Courts has been a serious problem. He said they would take measures to redeem the image of the judicial system. He observed that the need for a clear mandate of the Public Defenders, a group of lawyers hired to defend suspected felons unable to pay lawyers, were some of the issues that they would take notice of. The Acting Supreme Court head informed conference delegates that he was shocked over statistics release by the United Nations Rule of Law that the Judiciary System was improving gradually. ""Frankly, I thought we were way down looking at prior statistics that were released. But still there are problems. So, I take it as a duty in order to work hard to improve the system here,"" he stressed. He assured the conference delegates that in all of these areas of concern, he and his colleagues will continue to take the necessary steps to improve the image of the judiciary locally and internationally. During the three-day debate, there were presentations on a wide range of topics, including the overview of the criminal justice system; the judiciary and court administration; criminal justice chain and the role of the police; effective representation of defendants and vulnerable groups. Presentations were also made on two important reports; the report on performance of the court system around the country for the period 2010 to 2011 and the report on the use of the rule of law indicators.

He said this at the regional consultative workshop for the development of a national anti-corruption strategy held at Keetmanshoop yesterday. Saying that the  centralisation of power gives greater scope to corruption, Swartbooi said with decentralisation, people will have a greater say in their desire to hold corrupt official accountable. The distance to decision making is part of the big problem of corruption, Swartbooi remarked. He suggested that the workshop must come up with answers to fight corrution and also that the Office of the Ombudsman and the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) must cooperate in the fight against corruption. We want clarity between the ACC and Office of the Ombudsman which has been reduced to dealing with mere complaints of labour and smaller issues,  said Swartbooi. Swartbooi also took a swipe at  illiterate and semi-illiterate  community activists he claimed often failed in their own lives, for spreading false rumours about the existence of corrupt practices when in fact these were based on  the politics of jealousy . Do (ACC) not jump to  rebuttal assumptions  that all politicians, black empowerment entrepreneurs and chief regional officers are corrupt, and therefore prosecute them vigorously and publicly by all means. It s a danger,  he warned. Calling on the ACC to cater for remedial and reorientation counselling instead of just concentrating on the punitive aspect in its fight against corruption, Swartbooi remarked:  The sharp weapon against corruption is rooted in the societal consciousness of our people. The governor also condemned the  partnership  between the ACC and the media which he claimed is detrimental to the middle- class citizens of the country. He explained that a tender awarded on a basis of innovation, black and youth empowerment to an individual owning a close corporation is at times seen as corruption. The middle class citizens leads opportunities for greater prosperity of a country, but are being deliberately targeted and are now afraid to be innovative,  said Swartbooi. Swartbooi also urged the ACC to publicly vindicate government officials if no evidence to prosecute them is found following an investigation into false corruption claims against them. Also suggesting interaction between ACC and political parties, Swartbooi said: We want to see to what extent ACC interface with political parties to bring forward the best possible brains for political office. If you don t have this, you have disaster politics and disaster against the fight of corruption. This, he added, could lead to the disclosure of political parties  candidates before they are sworn in as political office bearers. Addressing the same workshop, ACC deputy director Erna Van Der Merwe said collective efforts are needed to prevent and fight corruption. It s so much better to prevent corruption than prosecuting the suspects,  said Van Der Merwe. luqman@namibian.com.na"378,The Namibian (Windhoek),4/15/13,New Lawyer for Antoine Mbok in Corruption Trial,,NAMIBIA (93%),Newspaper,Werner Menges,ENGLISH,,,16-Apr-13,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (72%)",527 words,LAWYERS (94%); CORRUPTION (92%); MONEY LAUNDERING (90%); BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (89%); TESTIMONY (89%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (89%); LARCENY & THEFT (89%); SENTENCING (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (78%); JUDGES (78%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (78%); GUILTY PLEAS (78%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (77%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (76%); BAIL (73%); LEGAL AID (72%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE trial of Cameroonian Antoine Mbok who is accused of corruption, theft and money laundering and a co-accused will not be starting as scheduled this month, because the accused has hired a new lawyer to represent him and the lawyer wants time to prepare for the case. This was revealed in the High Court in Windhoek when Mbok made another appearance on Friday before Judge Nate Ndauendapo. Ten days after Mbok s defence lawyer, Mese Tjituri, withdrew from the case, Legal Aid Directorate lawyer Brownell Uirab told Justice Ndauendapo that he had been instructed to represent Mbok in his trial. However, he said he had received his instructions only on Thursday, and needed time to prepare for the trial and he also needs more time to prepare for an application by the prosecution to have Mbok s bail conditions amended, he added. That application is scheduled to be heard on 24 April. The new dates for Mbok s trial will also be revealed on that date, Judge Ndauendapo said when he postponed the case. Mbok and his co-accused, Daniel Nghiwilepo, were due to go on trial on April 2 until April 12 facing five counts of corruption, alternatively theft, and five counts of money laundering. Their trial was scheduled to continue from 29 April to 3 May, and then from 1 to 12 July. Mbok and Nghiwilepo are facing charges in connection with the theft of five cheques from the Ministry of Finance in January and February 2010. The stolen cheques, with a total value of more than N$3,94 million, were then deposited into the bank account of a company belonging to Mbok which had a deceptively similar name as one of the abbreviations used for the Ministry of Finance, M Finance (Pty) Ltd, the prosecution claims. Close to N$372 000 was withdrawn from the account of M Finance before the account was frozen as a result of an investigation into the theft of the cheques, which were supposed to be paid to the Ministry of Finance. A former clerk with the ministry, Veronika Thomas, was initially charged with Mbok - who is being prosecuted both in his personal capacity and as a representative of M Finance - and Nghiwilepo. In February last year, she pleaded guilty to five counts of corruptly using her office or position for gratification. Mbok and Nghiwilepo however pleaded not guilty to all charges against them. Thomas testified in court that she stole the cheques after Nghiwilepo, who was a childhood friend, had asked her to do so. She testified that she gave the cheques to him, and that she did not know what he did with them afterwards. She told the court that she did not know Mbok, and that she never received any share of the stolen money. Thomas was sentenced to an effective eight years  imprisonment in late March last year. The conditions which prosecutor Shakwa Nyambe wants to be attached to Mbok s bail conditions are requirements that he surrenders his passport to the authorities and that he starts reporting to the police on a regular basis. Mbok has been issued with a new passport and has been travelling in and out of Namibia since he was released on a bail of N$3 000 in November 2010, the court has been told. Nghiwilepo is free on a warning from the court."381,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),4/19/13,Local Govt Ministry - Engine of Land Allocation Corruption,,ZAMBIA (79%),Newspaper,Martin Nyirenda,ENGLISH,,,26-Apr-13,,1469 words,REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (91%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); LAND USE PLANNING (90%); CITY GOVERNMENT (90%); MAYORS (88%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (69%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (69%); RURAL COMMUNITIES (59%) Zambia; Corruption; Land and Rural Issues; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"REPORTS of illegal land allocation by some councils amplify the depth of corruption in the Local Government Ministry and other line institutions in the public service. It has been proved vitally that illegal land allocation was an inside job involving officers working for relevant Government ministries and departments, something that boggles the Patriotic Front (PF) administration as much as it did with its predecessor, the MMD. Poor administration of land amalgamated with the hand of some corrupt council officers has become so complex with the potential to cripple and defeat the access and right to equitable State land distribution. As much as illegal land allocation perseveres to savagely distort the national economic growth patterns, reports of councillors who are actively involved in illegal land allocation continue to hit screaming news headlines. It is against this rather sad scenario that Kalulushi Municipal Council Mayor Howard Simpemba reminds councillors to avoid involving themselves in the illegal land practice because it was detrimental to national development. ""Let's maintain the spirit and the pace at which we are moving on the issues of land, let not a mayor or councillor allocate land to the people,"" he warns. To him, civic leaders should instead stay away from land allocation and leave the job to council technocrats. Mr Simpemba said this when he addressed the secondary Ordinary Meeting for the Kalulushi Municipal Council. He said Government, through the council, was making frantic strides to correct the macabre situation in a concerted initiative to purely restore the lost and now dim integrity in the land allocation processes. Councillors should strive to lead exemplary lives because of the bad perception created by the public due to dishonesty. But the teething blight of illegal land allocation is deep-rooted. Almost all councils across the spine of the country have a fair share of the quandary which has relentlessly undermined the very tenets of equal access to land, especially among the ordinary members of society. This is simply sad. Sad because only a few corrupt council officers were benefitting at the expense of the majority of us all put together! Interposed with astute concern marked with a lace of anger, Local Government and Housing Deputy Minister Forrie Tembo says Government was not sleeping over the matter of corruption in all sectors and that anyone found wanting - more especially in the land allocation exercise - would face the wrath of the long arm of the law. Some councillors at Kabwe Municipal Council have been upbeat illegally allocating land for selfish and personal gain, something which forced Mr Tembo to order management at the local authority to vigorously investigate and bring to book councillors allegedly engaged in the illegal allocation of land. Mr Tembo attests that illegal allocation of land was rampant for many reasons in the district (and so common at several local government outfits). He pledged to reverse the corrupt situation and bring sanity in the processes applied in land allocation. ""The council should investigate the councillors who are said to have been engaged in the illegal allocation of land and the law should take its course,"" he says. Corrupt land allocation schemes at Kabwe Municipal Council were only a lean side of the national predicament where some councillors and other civic leaders in various districts have continued to perpetuate the practice. Chingola District Council was recently hit by the corrupt hand in illegal land allocation by its councillors, especially in Kasompe area. The Chingola land scam was exposed during the Sixth National Development Plan (SNDP) 2010-2015 committee meeting, roundly defining the depth of abuse of authority by some irresponsible council officers was rampant. Recently, police arrested an officer from the same council for illegally issuing a piece of land to two persons. I contacted several councillors in Kitwe, Ndola and Lusaka who all declined to comment, arguing that they share the concerns raised by the minister of Lands that illegal land allocation involving some councillors was rampant in councils. The councillors said it would be naive of them to comment on illegal land allocation after the relevant ministers have already identified the need to purge the system used to administer State land. Senior Chief Ishindi of the Lunda people of Zambezi complained that he was under the weather and tired that Zambezi District Council was in the ill-habit of allocating plots in customary land without his permission. While Senior Chief Chiwala of Masaiti District recently exposed a cartel of unscrupulous people who were engaged in fraudulently distributing land in his chiefdom involving thousands of hectares, Government's efforts to abate the rot should be supported. The traditional leader told me in an interview that he was writing to Government investigative wings and other relevant institutions to help him come up with a formidable report on how land was illegally acquired in his chiefdom. He vowed to engage the Ministry of Agriculture, Lands Department and Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) to help him get to the root of the land scandal which forced him to cancel all land permits and further suspend issuance of title deeds and demarcation of land. My exploration into the matter, after perusing through forged documents at his palace which were crafted to be used as legal documents to obtain title deeds from Government, grimly showed that illegally acquired land in the chiefdom effectively involved the in-out-of some corrupt public officials from the local authority and public departments. Kitwe District Land Alliance (KDLA) coordinator Jestina Kunda calls on the Ministry of Lands to urgently audit the councils and ensure that local authorities account for the money collected to service plots because the current land allocation system was gravely flawed. Ms Kunda tells me that Government's decision to suspend allocation of sub-serviced plots of land by local authorities was a welcome development, adding that it was paramount that people should demand the Land Policy from their members of Parliament (MPs) in order to know the guidelines on how land was being managed in the country. She complains that the Land Policy, which has been in draft form since 2007, was not a working document. ""KDLA wonders how the Government has continued to administer land without a policy because the policy gives guide to the Land Act. The absence of the Land Policy has resulted in a lot of gaps in the manner land is being administered and that is how there are a lot of disputes surrounding land allocation and management,"" she argues. In 2010, an inter-ministerial taskforce was formed to address land acquisition with the prime role of looking at matters relating to land administration and its acquisition. This came at the heels of the lofty rate at which land was corruptly exchanging oiled-hands with money. Copperbelt Minister Mwenya Musenge tells me that illegal land allocation was a chief problem that should be fought from all angles and that Government was putting in place strategies to address all forms of corruption in councils. He was comfortably aware of corruption in society and by extension, Minister Musenge says he was also aware that some cartels had been forced in the councils to the extent of defrauding the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) and vehemently articulated public concern. He assures that Government was closing in on the culprits. Some people have been informed that the land belongs to another person despite having letters of offer from the council. There have been cases in Lusaka and elsewhere where the registers may reflect two people holding on title deeds for the same land. With the current illegal land allocation dilemma, Lands Minister Wylbur Simuusa says Government will only start allocating land banks meant for commercial purposes after a land audit has been concluded which was expected to start in August last year and that those implicated in the land scam would be forced to dance to the legal gauntlet. Aptly so, Minister Simuusa's suspension of allocation of land by all councils in the country was not a stray attempt to halt the bane. As Government confronts the plaque, there is also every need to generate massive public sensitisation among all stakeholders on the need to acquire land using legally applied mechanisms. More so, Government should make the broom at all councils in the country sweep out the putrid progeny which has formed to steal State land from the poor. Otherwise, the question to ponder which also supplicates obvious rejoins remains: Is the hand of some councillors going to continue to be a ripe recipe to accelerate official antics associated illegal land allocation."382,The Daily Monitor,4/21/13,Corruption doesnt affect only investors,,UGANDA (94%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,24-Jun-14,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (73%)",349  words,CORRUPTION (91%); ENTREPRENEURSHIP (90%); BRIBERY (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (89%); POLITICS (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (75%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (75%); INFRASTRUCTURE (71%); DAMS & RESERVOIRS (71%); CONSTRUCTION (71%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (51%),"The President was launching Vision 2040, the new national framework for development unveiled last week in Kampala. He said it was illegal for bureaucrats to delay, mishandle, solicit bribes or frustrate any entrepreneur and their investments in Uganda - whether local or foreign - and instructed his Principal Private Secretary (PPS) to follow up on all matters relating to entrepreneurial frustration. The President's indignation is understandable, especially coming on the heels of the botched Karuma Dam construction tendering process in which it is alleged bureaucrats and politicians solicited as much as Shs500 billion ($200 million) in bribes from tendering firms. Many people who have done business in Uganda will testify to the frustrations corruption at various levels of the bureaucracy brings to their bottom line. But the president should perhaps be looking further than private enterprise and also take special interest in how bureaucratic inefficiency and corruption affects service delivery and therefore how this impacts on the lives of the ordinary Ugandans. Many ordinary Ugandans' efforts to improve their personal life and that of their immediate families has been hampered by corruption, nepotism, and outright theft of public goods like medicines and monies meant for roads, education etc thus keeping them in the cycle of poverty and disease. Part of the problem has been the executive's inability to tackle firmly those accused of corruption in government, thus sustaining a culture of impunity in the bureaucracy and among the political leaders which has now grown to the extent that it is threatening private investment. The leadership must therefore stop sending mixed signals and establish a firm hand in tackling cases of corruption without fear or favour through established judicial processes. Once this is done, then there will be no need to assign the President's PPS duties such as following investors' frustrations with corrupt bureaucrats and thereby creating a parallel judicial and investigative process. Which might also not be spared the scourge of competition."383,New Democrat (Monrovia),4/24/13,Officials in Corruption Web,,LIBERIA (96%); UNITED STATES (92%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,26-Apr-13,,836 words,CORRUPTION (97%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (90%); HUMAN RIGHTS (90%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (90%); CIVIL SERVICES (89%); JURY TRIALS (89%); VERDICTS (89%); BRIBERY (89%); PRISONS (86%); INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (78%); COUNTIES (78%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (78%); DISMISSALS (78%); DAMAGES (78%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (78%); JAIL SENTENCING (76%); SENTENCING (76%); CORRECTIONS (76%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (75%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (75%); MISTRIAL (74%); LAWYERS (74%); ENERGY & UTILITY LAW (72%); BAIL (71%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS (71%); BOARDS OF DIRECTORS (64%); FORESTRY & LOGGING (62%); LOGGING INDUSTRY (62%) Liberia; Corruption,"Written by ND Staff The latest Human Rights Report from the U.S. Statement Department claims Liberian government officials are engaged in corrupt practices with impunity, whereas the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC) is weak and underfunded to perform effectively. ""Officials engaged in corrupt practices with impunity. Low pay levels for the civil service, minimal job training, and few court convictions exacerbated official corruption and a culture of impunity,"" Section 4 of the report pinpointed. But the report questions why the Liberian law does not provide criminal penalties for official corruption, although criminal penalties exist for economic sabotage, mismanagement of funds, and other corruption-related acts. The Human Rights Report: ""Government dismissed officials for alleged corruption and recommended others for prosecution. The LACC and the Ministry of Justice are responsible for exposing and combating official corruption. It adds that the LACC is empowered to prosecute any case that the ministry declines to prosecute, but notes, ""the LACC remained a weak option because of underfunding, understaffing, and judicial bottlenecks."" LACC, during the reporting period, investigated 16 cases and recommended eight for prosecution, resulting in one conviction. The document indicated how MOJ, despite LACC's objections, dropped charges against the former inspector general of police for irregularities in the procurement of uniforms. The LACC decided to prosecute, and the case remained pending before the court at the end of the year. In July 2011 police rearrested a former Liberia Telecommunications Authority chairman for alleged bail jumping in the 2010 case of his reported misuse of LD5.2 million (US$106,000). The first trial ended in a hung jury. After a second trial, he was found guilty and sentenced in August to six years in prison. In September, following reports in the press and from NGOs about irregularities in the Forestry Development Agency's issuance of Private Use Permits that authorized timber harvesting, President Sirleaf convened a Special Independent Investigative Body (SIIB) whose recommendations for administrative dismissals of government employees and criminal prosecution of the most egregious actors in the government and private sector were endorsed as corrective actions. ""Judges were susceptible to bribes for awarding damages in civil cases. Judges sometimes requested bribes to try cases, released detainees from prison, or found defendants not guilty in criminal cases. Defense attorneys and prosecutors sometimes suggested defendants pay bribes to secure favorable rulings from or to appease judges, prosecutors, jurors, and police officers,"" the report claims, citing: the MOJ continued its calls to reform the jury system. It noted the misuse of county development funds, which led to a moratorium in 2010 because of evidence of frequent misuse, involvement of the ministries of internal affairs and planning and reauthorization of county officials to operate the funds. It recalled the dismissal or suspension of several officials at LPRC for corruption and the subsequent dissolution of its board of directors as per GAC recommendations. The GAC cited board members' alleged acts of amending by-laws to allow them to accept payments in addition to their salaries for services to the LPRC. Police corruption was a problem. During the year under review the LNP investigated reports of police misconduct or corruption, and several LNP officers were suspended or dismissed. Meanwhile, the government continued to take steps to improve transparency as the GAC continued ministerial audits and referred findings to the legislature. However, the report says the legislature did not recommend any GAC cases to the MOJ for prosecution. Although the GAC prepared 13 audits on March 25, the auditor general was not nominated for another term, and the Senate confirmed the President's new nominee in August. Though assets declarations were enforced, citizens and the press could not easily access officials' asset declarations, as release of the declarations remained at the discretion of the LACC. The Finance Ministry published the national budget and quarterly financial results, while and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) published financial statements, but many of these SOEs had not been audited for several years. Periodic short-term advisors helped improve financial management, purchasing, and contracting practices and instituted financial controls that increased government revenues and helped to curb corrupt practices. The report mentioned the failure of government ministries and agencies to always adhere to public procurement regulations, particularly for natural resource concessions, or to government vetting procedures when hiring ministry officials. It raised concerns about transparency in handling finances of state-owned enterprises and autonomous bodies. Meanwhile, Justice Minister Chrisatina has reacted to the report saying government is fighting corruption."384,New Democrat (Monrovia),4/25/13,Police Indicted in New Corruption Report,,LIBERIA (95%); UNITED STATES (94%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%); SENEGAL (79%); AFRICA (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,"CALIFORNIA, USA (79%)",26-Apr-13,"DAKAR, SENEGAL (53%)",249 words,CORRUPTION (92%); INDICTMENTS (90%); MISCONDUCT (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); POLICE FORCES (90%); POLICE MISCONDUCT (88%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); HUMAN RIGHTS (73%); FOCUS GROUPS (71%); LARCENY & THEFT (71%) Liberia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Within less than two years, another report has uncovered corruption in the Liberia National Police with misconduct in addition to the report of the Action for Genuine Democratic Alternative (AGENDA).

Mr Sichinga, who is Agriculture and Livestock Minister and a professional accountant, said accountancy was a noble profession whose members should resist being used in 'doctoring' accounting figures or results. He said the Patriotic Front (PF) Government was seeking the strong contribution of the accountancy profession not only in preparing accounts, but also in enhancing sound management within businesses and organisations. Mr Sichinga was speaking in Livingstone on Saturday night during the 28th Zambia Institute of Chartered Accountants (ZICA) Annual General Meeting (AGM) ball. ""Let me remind the ZICA membership that against the background of corruption, and considerable financial irregularities, accountants of this country are called upon to increasingly develop and maintain sound accounting practices. ""Accountants must remain steadfast as the beacon of financial consciousness of their individual organisations,"" Mr Sichinga said. He urged accountants to work impartially and fairly according to the taxation legislation of the country. ""When we as Government and as citizens read about apparent unethical tax practices in some firms in our country, the question which comes to my mind is where was the accountant or what was the role of the accountant in designing the scandalous practice? ""I ask these questions because some accountants actively participate and connive with their clients in the name of tax planning which deprives your own country of revenue intended to build the economy and to bring about prosperity,"" he said. At the same function, ZICA president Frederick Banda said his organisation was concerned about Government's resolve to appoint chief executive officers (CEOs) for State-owned enterprises (SOEs) before appointing Boards of Directors. He urged the Government to develop a culture of competitive processes through public invitation of citizens to apply for positions. ""When the Government appoints the CEO for SOEs and then appoint the Board, we get the confusion at Zambia Railways Limited (ZRL) where the CEO has no regard for the Board and the hands of the Board are tied from taking an appropriate action on the CEO. ""There should be a better way of doing things going forward as the recent happenings in ZRL make sad reading,"" Mr Banda said. On the recent announcement by the Government that it would create a microfinance institution where civil servants would be borrowing money at five per cent interest rate below inflation, Mr Banda said the move should be reconsidered. He said ZICA was concerned that the microfinance institution would be created by taxpayers' money and yet workers were subjected to high interest rates by the commercial banking sector. He said ZICA's major concern was on the sustainability of such a project as taxpayers would continue subsidising civil servants as they would be borrowing below the cost of capital. ""Why can't civic servants participate in the mainstream economy by borrowing from the commercial banking sector like any other citizen? Why should borrowers get money at lower than what we believe is the cost of capital?"" he asked. On the Link Zambia 8000 road project, Mr Banda said the initiative would improve accessibility and connectivity within the country."387,The Herald (Harare),5/1/13,Gutu RDC Chair in Court for Corruption,,ZIMBABWE (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,1-May-13,,365 words,CONTRACT AWARDS (90%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%); ARRESTS (90%); RURAL COMMUNITIES (89%); CORRUPTION (89%); ARREST WARRANTS (89%); EXECUTIVES (78%); LITIGATION (78%); TALKS & MEETINGS (73%); WITNESSES (73%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (70%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Governance,"SUSPENDED Gutu rural district council chairman Daniel Jinga and chief executive officer Frederick Tozvireva appeared in court on Monday on allegations of flouting laid down procedures in the awarding of a US$400 000 water reticulation tender. They were not formally charged with criminal abuse of office when they appeared before Gutu provincial magistrate Mr Nyasha Vitorini. Jinga (43) of Tigere village in Gadzingo communal lands and Tozvireva (47) of Mpandawana in Gutu were remanded out of custody on their own cognisance to May 7 for trial. The duo allegedly paid Bruvoc Construction 40 percent deposit for a water reticulation project against the recommendations of a full council meeting. Two key prosecution witnesses -- Masvingo provincial administrator Mr Felix Chikovo and Gutu District Administrator Mr Roy Hove -- were issued with warrants of arrest after they failed to come to court. The two later showed up in court resulting in the magistrate cancelling the warrants of arrest that had been issued against them. Charges against Jinga and Tozvireva arose in June last year when Gutu local authority flighted a tender for a water reticulation project in Munhende and Chomufuli residential areas at Mpandawana Growth Point. Council's finance committee, which was adjudicating on the tenders, resolved that no company that would have won the tender would be paid a deposit before commencing work on the project. Three days later the water reticulation tender was awarded to Bruvoc Construction and it is alleged that Jinga and Tozvireva colluded and facilitated payment of about US$103 000 to Bruvoc Construction as deposit in breach of the council resolution agreed upon by a full council. The case was reported to the district administrator Mr Hove who then informed the police leading to the duo's arrest. Jinga, who was elected councillor in 2008 on an MDC-T ticket recently crossed the floor to the Professor Welshman Ncube's MDC formation.

The personal side of the situation entailed my confusion, disappointment and sense of hopelessness towards the lag in professional growth. Environmentally, this was complemented by the popular exuberance witnessed at the detainment of high-level government officials accused of corruption. My childhood was filled with atypical struggles between myself - a kid who embrace peculiarity, and my parents - guardians who craved seeing their lone son become as sociable as possible. In a family, which cherishes incessant expansion, I was a kid who negated popular lines. As a typical Abyssinian senior, my father used to get endlessly frustrated with my constant reservation in treading accepted lines. He even used to denounce me with harsh words, in order to get me back on the popular trend. Unfortunately, it took me close to two decades to realise the core of my childhood struggle; disengagement. Disengagement, as it is often dubbed, remains a major issue in the fast-paced, high-pressure economic and political landscape. Major institutional establishments of our fair nation suffer from the ever-growing costs associated with the very problem that, too, shrouded my childhood. As it is perceived popularly, disengagement involves - inaction, unwillingness to take part in group efforts, a lack of initiative to collaborate and a detachment from established interests. Therefore, generally it equates to a negative force regarding group effort. It holds the growth aspiration of groups back. The institutional version of this problem is seen infecting all major establishments of our contemporary political economy. Companies, political parties, state structures and religious institutions are infected with the problem, so much so that their growth is being significantly hampered. Disengaged employees are a common reality within the Ethiopian private sector. Disenfranchises with a top-down management style, uncompetitive salaries, poor working environments and carrier lags etc, means that many employees of the sector are seen being disengaged from the brands, values and visions of their companies. Their disengagement seems to make them inherently focussed on the gaps within the system. As much as most breathe disapproval, they fill the air with pessimistic talk and negative acts. The little attention that managers afford to disengaged employees worsens the case even further. Often, it is only after it is too late to reverse the damage to the working culture, values and vision of a company, that managers act, if ever, to change things. A situation that could have concluded with some sort of corrective action, is often seen transpiring into an ugly dismissal or emotional resignation. Ethiopian political parties are not new to this disengagement, either. Most have members who simply fill rosters with their profiles. They are little connected to the ideological leanings of the parties, or decisions of the higher echelons of power. One can witness the magnitude of the disengagement present within political parties, simply by considering the ratio of publicised political frictions to the size of the politically active population. Continuous frictions, fractures, disintegration and closures are all results of the unattended disengagement of members. The magnitude and cost of disengagement is even sizeable when it comes to the ruling party itself. With rising membership numbers - estimated to have reached 7.5 million - the party has grown too big to be able to effectively trace disengagements. The case has become even worse with the party doubling as the caretaker of the state structure. With the EPRDF, disengaged party members have ample excuses to cover their failures. They have all sorts of bureaucratic deficits to attach their disengagement to. The very culture of democratic centralism practiced by the party, reduces the probability of identifying disengaged cadres at an early stage. Rather, it is often allowed to sail through the ladders of leadership, hidden under the very shells of group responsibility. Seemingly, the costs of the disengagements within the ruling party are far more than the costs in any other establishment. A disengaged ruling party official would not just settle for breathing pessimism through the corridors. Rather, they would make use of their disposable power to obtain improper benefits. Therein lays the space for corruption. As all tiers of the ruling party seem to embrace some level of disengagement, there is a progressive deviation (some call it evolution) from the core principles of accountability. This is further complicated by the decreased leverage of the chairman to purge officials identified to be disengaged, when compared to his corporate counterparts. Hence, malpractices are seen getting increasingly destructive. And, the EPRDF of old, identified by its tough evaluations and struggle for ideological purity, is shrinking into a party shrouded in complacency and corruption. Reversing the current trend of disengagement in our fair nation demands proactive leadership at different levels. All these individuals, from corporate CEOs to government officials, with the authority to make decisions, ought to have a sharp sense to signs of disengagement. It is only if they are able to identify it at an early state that they could treat it effectively and avoid its damaging impacts. No firing, purging and detainment could reverse the damage once it is done. Getachew T. Alemu Is the Op-Ed Editor for Fortune.

And, indeed, the surprise was not unwarranted. The list of suspects included Melaku Fenta, director general of the Ethiopian Revenues & Customs Authority (ERCA). For distant observers, his image was associated with the modernisation drive of the ERCA under his leadership. As the state media emphasises, on public revenue performance reports and tax awareness, Melaku received high publicity over the past five years. Moreover, given the relentless pressure on many businessmen to pay backlog tax liabilities, the public was justified in offering high regard to him. Of course, many doubted the ruling party's resolve to hold its top men accountable. Though the Federal Ethics & Anti-Corruption Commission (FEACC) reports every year that it has secured hundreds of convictions, the list has hardly included any high-ranking politicians for more than a decade. Although Meleku is not member of the EPRDF's executive committee, he is one of the top 13 officials within the Amhara National Democratic Movement (ANDM) - a member of the EPRDF. And, the trend for senior officials had been that they would be demoted or dismissed following a rebuke in an intra-party evaluation, without seeing the doorsteps of a courtroom. Many are still sceptical of whether Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn has the power to embark on such a high-profile house cleaning. The doubt partly comes from an erroneous assumption that he needs to be as powerful as Meles to lead the government. However, the scepticism of others emanates from their doubt on the cohesiveness and institutional strength of the ruling party, which is often considered as the primary factor for the strength of a parliamentary government. Indeed, some would have interpreted the recent corruption charges as a symptom of faction, had Melaku ever been implicated with any intra-party political struggle. For careful observers, however, the surprise would only be on the details, rather than on the crackdown itself. As I noted last September, the fact that Hailemariam is part of the ""new generation"" of leadership works in his favour in some ways. ""He can remove incompetent and corrupt officials, subject to agreement of the ruling party heavyweights, without being afraid of getting accused of betraying his old friends. Not to forget that the current chairmen of the four EPRDF member parties, including Hailemariam, are not perceived by the public as corrupt. That gives him the political capital and the moral authority to act strongly."" Indeed, as is the case with any new leader, Hailemariam needs a flagship project or agenda of his own and, indeed, he has been hinting that all along. In his speech during his inauguration as Prime Minister, he expressed his intent by using the phrase - ""officials infected by corruption"", the harshest in years. Earlier this year, he called upon the public to forward tips on corrupted officials, pledging that he will personally follow up the matter. Both his wording and tone are evidently designed to emphasise the magnitude of the matter and was unusual, as the EPRDFites often decline to make personal pledges. No matter what one may wish to think of his personal power, the Prime Ministerial job is not a place where one drops words at random. No less importantly, time is of the essence. By Hailemariam's own admission, administrative injustice and corruption are the weak edges of the ruling party. Although researches indicate that the prevalence of corruption practices in Ethiopia is moderate, in relative terms, the public perception is high and remains as the main cause of dissatisfaction. Moreover, the trend continues to affect the resource allocation and utilisation for economic plans, on which the ruling party's political legitimacy highly depends. All these have to be reversed as soon as possible. The longer Hailemariam waits, the less likely that he will be able to launch a major campaign at all. But, it will be hasty to conclude that Hailemariam intends to crusade against all corrupted officials and all such practices through legal actions. To begin with, not only a few principal features of corruption in Ethiopia emanate from the cultural and institutional limitations. For example, favouritism and using public property for personal affairs are deemed to be ""occupational privileges"" that come along with being a civil servant or an official. Even private firms rarely see things differently, although, fortunately, commercial considerations force them to take restraint. If Hailemariam embarks on an all-out anti-corruption crusade with purely legal perspectives, he may not see the end of it. That is as such not because every official and civil servant is intentionally engaged in corrupt practices. Certainly, many limit themselves to subsidising modest personal needs with public resources. The main problem is the absence of sufficient manuals and lack of established precedents that put a clear delineation between favouritism and the proper scope and application of discretionary powers, which is a necessary component of any public agency. It has been observed, more often than not, that an anti-corruption crackdown in an institution literally freezes its services, as officers become too terrified to make decisions. The anti-corruption crackdown, like any other governmental plan, is subject to considerations of opportunity costs. The political and economic returns of the anti-corruption campaign determine the amount of time and political capital that the ruling party will invest on it. Evidently, creating wealth by sustaining the current socio-economic progress is of primary concern. Similarly, the need to preserve political stability is of paramount importance - a factor that forced the federal government to turn a blind eye to corruption in some regions over the past two decades. Hailemariam's anti-corruption crackdown will certainly remain in the spotlight for months to come, accompanied by news of political and legal measures against corrupt officials, businessmen and institutions. But, many potential suspects will probably remain untouched, provided that they scale-back their current levels of embezzlement and keep their hands away from the kind of misconducts that sabotage key projects and counter the effort to change public perception.

For example, money from Gavi fund was swindled, the public was taken through the circus of charging suspects, trying and imprisoning them but at the  end of the day, even those who were imprisoned were released.

Mr Chingwinyiso opposed the application, arguing that they supplied the defence with all the necessary documents. But Mr Kachambwa ruled in favour of Gumbo and ordered the State to furnish him with the relevant and necessary documents before the commencement of trial. The State alleged that in 2010, ZACC approached the Home Affairs Ministry seeking alternative accommodation when their landlords were about to evict them. The ministry instructed Gumbo to look for alternative property and he identified 872 Betterment Close in Mt Pleasant that belonged to Diane Spalletah. It is alleged that Gumbo went back to the ministry where he requested for US$1,68 million to buy the property and Government deposited US$1,7 million into a ZACC account. Gumbo allegedly instructed his subordinates Sukai Tongogara, Edwin Mubataripi, Christopher Chisango and Gibson Mangwiro to form a shelf company called Property Mortgage where they became directors with equal shares. A ZACC administration and human resources manager deposited the US$1,68 million into a CBZ account for Perpetual Properties trust account. It is believed that Gumbo's daughter was an administrator for Perpetual Properties and she was the one who did the transactions. The property was bought for US$1,2 million, which was fully paid to the owner Spalletah by Perpetual Properties. Perpetual Properties deducted their commission amounting to US$44 500, leaving a balance of US$435 500."397,The Daily Monitor,6/5/13,"URA facilitates corruption, says new report",,UGANDA (94%),Newspaper,ISMAIL MUSA LADU -1,ENGLISH,,,25-Jun-14,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (78%)",416  words,TAX LAW (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); RESEARCH REPORTS (90%); BRIBERY (90%); TAX AUTHORITIES (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (78%); TAX ENFORCEMENT (77%); TAXES & TAXATION (77%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (77%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (77%); BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (73%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (71%),"Most businesses are unwilling to formalise their operations because they are helped by unscrupulous employees of the Uganda Revenue Authority, says a new report. The report by Uganda Debt Network (UDN), an NGO involved in good governance causes, says instead of collecting taxes, the employees resort to taking bribes. ""Some informal sector actors connive with the Uganda Revenue Authority officials and local government tax law enforcers to dodge paying taxes, but end up paying bribes in order not to be caught on the wrong side of the law,"" reads the report. With such anomalies, informal businesses lack the motivation to formalise as kickbacks look the easy option, said the report. According to the Uganda Bureau of Statistics, the informal sector covers all business activities that are normally characterised by: absence of final accounts, have less than 5 employees, no fixed location, in most cases not registered and sometimes such businesses are operate for a short time only. The UDN director of programmes, Mr Julius Kapwepwe, said the findings confirm the widely held view that the problem of tax compliance lies in the tax prefect's administration system.According to the report, the current tax administration seems to favour those in the formal sector and those who can pay bribes-mostly informal sector players. Kampala City Traders Association spokesperson Isa Sekitto said corruption at URA is not a new thing: ""I am aware of a situation where a container of shoes was entered into URA system as mosquito nets and instead of paying Shs30m only Shs4m was paid as revenue."" But URA's assistant commissioner for compliance management, Mr Protazio Begumisa, said the tax body has over the years registered successes because it has fought corruption. ""From what I am hearing it seems we need to get back to the drawing board,"" Mr Begumisa said. His colleague in charge of service management, Mr Simon Ngabirano, however criticised the report, saying it's laden with several inaccuracies, especially mixing the operations of formal and informal traders. The State Minister of Finance (General duties), Mr Fred Omach, said his ministry would study the report and implement the recommendations, including instituting an investigation into the allegations. But in his speech he said the tax body has some challenges, but overall it has performed well. He said paying taxes is an obligation, even in the bible, stressing the biblical saying that goes: ""Give Ceaser what belong to him (Ceaser)."398,The New Times (Kigali),6/5/13,MPs Warn About Gender Corruption,,RWANDA (94%),Newspaper,Jean Mbonyinshuti,ENGLISH,,,6-Jun-13,,135 words,TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); EMPLOYMENT SEARCH (68%); EMPLOYMENT (67%) Rwanda; Women and Gender; Corruption,"Members of the African Parliamentary Network have called for concerted efforts to uproot gender based corruption, which has remained a threat because it is never reported.

""With a common policy and strategy on corruption, it can help the region to move forward because we get a lot of problems with this vice,"" he said. According to a study carried out by Transparency International in August last year, Uganda has the highest bribery levels in the region, at 40.7 per cent, followed by Tanzania (39.1 per cent). Rwanda is the least corrup country in the region at 2.5 per cent. Connie Bwiza Sekamana, a member of the African Parliamentary Network Against Corruption (APNAC-Rwanda chapter) urged all stakeholders in the fight against graft to adopt zero tolerance to corruption.

The observers, who spoke during the launch of a campaign to tackle gender-based sexual corruption early this week, said this kind of corruption handicaps all sectors of the country since it is not simple to find any evidence. The campaign, which is being undertaken by the African Parliamentarian's Network against Corruption (APNAC), Rwanda chapter in collaboration with Transparency International Rwanda, the National Women Council, Profemme-Twese Hamwe, among other partners, will be taken to eight districts. ""Victims [of sex corruption] are challenged with lack of evidence when the matter is taken to courts,"" said Francine Umurungi, in charge of Institutional Development and Advocacy at Transparency Rwanda. She however, called upon every individual to act as one team towards eradicating the crime. ""If all institutions- from the police, Parliament, legal and religious institutions, civil society, private sector- and individuals collaborate in the efforts to tackle sex corruption, it will be stopped,"" Umurungi said. About 85 per cent of victims of gender based sexual corruption are female, a study conducted two years ago by Transparency International Rwanda has revealed. The study also states that gender-based corruption in workplaces exists in Rwanda and particularly affects women in search for jobs and the private sector. But despite the findings, the problem remains unspoken, according to Senator Marie Claire Mukasine who chairs African Parliamentarian's Network against Corruption (APNAC)-Rwanda. ""This is a big issue but people seem to pay less attention to it,"" Mukasine said. ""I believe this is affecting efforts to end it"". With the aim of involving members of the community, the campaign will target especially the youth and females, according to officials. It would involve selected panellists who will engage the population on the issue. ""Through discussions we collect testimonies and ideas on how we can tackle the problem. We also share the importance of speaking out against such malpractices and reporting them as everyone stands for their rights,"" Mukasine said. While launching the campaign in Muhanga District, a primary school teacher said she was asked to offer sexual favours before she could be offered a well paying job. ""I had promises to be paid Rwf 250 000 a month but for me to get that job I had to first sleep with the boss,"" the woman, who earns only Rwf 40,000, testified. ""I refused the offer."" Rwanda is credited for being the least corrupt country in the Eastern Africa Region and is also revered for its impressive progress in the promotion of gender equality."402,The Namibian (Windhoek),6/11/13,Jacobs' Corruption Trial Resumes,,NAMIBIA (92%); GERMANY (79%),Newspaper,Luqman Cloete,ENGLISH,,,11-Jun-13,,533 words,CORRUPTION (92%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%); CATERING SERVICES (89%); CONTRACT AWARDS (89%); TESTIMONY (89%); LITIGATION (89%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); LAWYERS (75%); APPROVALS (69%); GOVERNORS (67%); GARDENING (53%) Namibia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE corruption trial former Karas Regional Council employee Salmaan Jacobs, resumed in the Keetmanshoop Regional Court yesterday. Jacobs who was employed as the chief regional officer (CRO) pleaded not guilty to five counts of corruption when his trail started in mid-August last year. Two of the counts originate from subsistence and travel allowance claims. Jacobs allegedly defrauded the Karas Regional Council of close to N$32 000 by claiming N$49 020 from the council for attending a month-long, all-expenses-paid workshop in Germany. Two other counts are based on a catering contract which Jacobs awarded as the council's tender board chairman to Sadadi Enterprise CC, a company he allegedly had an interest in, in October and November 2006. On the fifth count Jacobs is accused of using his position to obtain gratification by allegedly allocating N$30 000 to Sadadi Enterprise on the pretext that it was meant for a community gardening project at Berseba. On resumption of the trial, incumbent CRO, Saul Kahuika, testifed that Jacobs' involvement in the catering tender awarded to Sadadi Enterprises CC, a company he had interest in, in November 2006 appeared to be minimal. I knew it was his wife's company (Sadadi Enterprise CC) and that he should have recused himself, but it appears that his involvement was minimal on the basis of the payment voucher sign offs,  Kahuika testified. However, Kahuika could not tell the court with certainty that Jacobs had indeed recused himself during the approval of the tender award to Sadadi Enterprise. When the defence counsel put to him that his client had recused himself from the tender award process to Sadadi Enterprise, Kahuika replied:  I can only speculate . Kahuika admitted that the N$21 350 tender awarded to Sadadi Enterprise CC for rendering catering services during the inauguration of the Warmbad Hotsprings did not go through the normal tendering process which required a tender session at which point Jacobs could have made known his interest in the company and recused himself. However, Kahuika added that the CRO at times used his discretion to only invite three quotations if it was not feasible to go on tender depending on the urgency, scope and expenditure of the services required by council. I was satisfied that Jacobs was not involved when singing for the payment vouchers and acceptance of the quotation,  Kahuika commented on some of the payment vouchers in favour of Sadadi Enterprise he had signed off. Kahuika said the payment voucher Jacobs had signed for catering services Sadadi had rendered had no bearing on the tender award decision since it was an additional payment to the extra meals and drinks the company had served at the inauguration. Kahuika further testified that the travel and subsistence claim payment to Jacobs was  above board,  since it was signed off on recommendation by the former governor Dawid Boois, given Jacobs' motivation that he be paid on Rate 2 instead of Rate 3. The court was told that Jacobs should have been paid on rate 3 since the trip to Germany on which he went was fully sponsored. But, Jacobs requested to be paid on rate 2 due to other envisaged costs that were not covered by the sponsor."403,The Namibian (Windhoek),6/13/13,Witnesses Turn Hostile in Jacobs' Corruption Trial,,GERMANY (92%); NAMIBIA (90%); CENTRAL EUROPE (57%),Newspaper,Luqman Cloete,ENGLISH,,,13-Jun-13,,732 words,CORRUPTION (93%); WITNESSES (91%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); TESTIMONY (90%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (89%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); EXECUTIVES (77%); LAWYERS (75%); CATERING SERVICES (70%); GARDENING (53%) Namibia; Corruption,"THE prosecution suffered a setback in the corruption trial of former Karas CRO, Salmaan Jacobs, when two state witnesses turned hostile.

I told the prosecutor and the ACC investigator before I took to the witness stand that there might have been a misunderstanding regarding my affidavit, Apollus told the court. According to Apollus, the ACC investigator only asked her questions and presented an affidavit on which she had signed. In an affidavit taken from her in 2008, Apollus who is a assistant accountant at the Karas Regional Council stated that she had completed Jacobs travel expenses claim for a trip he undertook to Germany without any supporting documents and on Jacobs' verbal instruction. In her evidence in chief on Tuesday, however, Apollus testified that she had shifted the task of completing the claim to her colleague Hendrik after she got stuck halfway through calculating the Jacobs' travel expenses. Apollus said Jacobs' claim, together with the supporting documents, was then presented to the council's accountant for approval. Confused about the affidavit pertaining to Jacobs' travel and subsistence claim, Apollus remarked:   I thought I gave a statement about catering matter because I have only completed those documents . When the defense counsel Willem Visser put it to her that she didn't make the statement and that it was  false in totality,  Apollus remained silent. The court recorded a no answer on the part of Apollus to Vissers' claims.

Does the statement reflect the evidence that the claim was submitted to Sam Herero (council's accountant)?, Were you told what to say or was it your own words?  Visser again asked Apollus who replied  I can't recall .

I have said this after threats of arrests,  Jimmy claimed. Jimmy described the circumstances under which the affidavit was taken from him as  harsh  adding:  Some of these things I was made to say . When asked by the state prosecutor Veiko Alexander why he had not reported the ill treatment when the his affidavit was taken, Jimmy replied:  There were so many things, and I just carried on with my life . In his evidence which continued yesterday, Jimmy said Jacobs had recused himself from catering tender award to Sadadi Enterprise CC. According to Jimmy, when he approached Jacobs with Sadadi Enterprise CC quotation, Jacobs said:  I don't want to deal with this issue, take it to the other directors When Visser asked his impression about Jacobs' alleged utterance that he doesn't want to deal with the company's quotation, Jimmy replied:  The company belongs to his wife and he felt it's conflict of interest  .

The Commission appealed for the injunction claiming that the damages to the government, allegedly caused by the accused, amounted to 400 million Br. The Commission has been making requests like this since it started its crackdown on alleged corruption activities in the tax sector, a month ago. It has so far detained close to 60 individuals, including - Melaku Fenta, former director general of the Ethiopian Revenues & customs Authority (ERCA); his deputy, Gebrewahed W. Giorgis; advisor, Mamo Abdi; chief prosecutor of the ERCA, Eshetu Wolde Semayat and deputy prosecutor, Markeneh Alemayehu.

Plc - a company involved in the import of construction machineries and manufacture of blankets and yarn; and Simachew Kebede, part owner of the intercontinental hotel. The accused included - customs officials, transitors and military personnel in Adama. The Commission has also had two earlier injunctions related to damages amounting to 90 million Br. The first, on May 21, 2013, involved freezing the accounts of 228 people, including those detained and other people connected to them, at 20 banks and savings institutions. The second, which came two weeks ago, involved 92 vehicles, 53 of which belonged to Nega G. Egziabhere. The lawyers of Ketema, Simachew and Fekru Maru, (MD) who runs Addis Cardiac Hospital, have appealed to reverse the decision to freeze their clients' accounts.

The current request for property attachment includes the two-storey home registered under Melaku Fenta in Yeka District; a 500sqm home registered under Gebrewahed W. Giorgis in Legetafo-Legedadi Town, Oromia Special Zone; and two other properties registered under two suspects, Mamo Kiros and Yadessa Midekssa, and their wives. The Commission also requested a property attachment ban on buildings, homes and land registered to K.K.

The Black Monday Movement activists had gone to the ministry to petition the finance minister over the budget, which they say, is a burden to Ugandans. They carried anti-corruption placards. Others had wheelbarrows loaded with sand to symbolise the tax burden Ugandans are carrying.

Hangula was informed that the prosecutor general has decided to indict him on six charges when he made another appearance in the Windhoek Magistrate's Court on Friday last week. His case was postponed to 20 January 2014 for plea and trial. The date was agreed between Hangula's defence lawyer, Sisa Namandje, and Public Prosecutor Eric Naikaku, in light of the prosecutor general's decision on the prosecution of Hangula which was made available to Magistrate Hileni Kavara on Friday. Hangula was informed that the prosecutor general has decided that he should be arraigned in the Windhoek Magistrate's Court on a total of six charges. The charges, five of which stem from allegations that the Standard 10 (Grade 12) certificate which Hangula has been using is not genuine, are counts of fraud, theft, forgery, two counts of uttering, and a charge of receiving stolen property. In the charges as provided to the court it is alleged that Hangula stole a senior certificate from the Ministry of Education on 6 May 1993, and that he defrauded the Department of Prisons, which was then in the Ministry of Home Affairs, on the same day by presenting the senior certificate to it as a genuine document in order to get a promotion in his rank and salary scale. It is also alleged that he falsified a senior certificate on 6 May 1993 by changing a symbol and grade of one of the subjects on the certificate and omitting another subject, and that he committed the offence of uttering by presenting the false certificate to the Department of Prisons on 6 May 1993 and to the Polytechnic of Namibia on 2 February 2009. In the last charge it is alleged that Hangula received stolen building materials from someone in Windhoek on 7 November 2010. Allegations about the validity of his school certificate have been dogging Hangula for close to 20 years. Despite this, he has continued to improve his academic qualifications, and graduated at the Polytechnic of Namibia with a Bachelor of Criminal Justice (Correctional Management) degree last year. Since being charged, Hangula has been suspended from his post with full pay, pending the outcome of the case. Hangula is free on bail of N$2 000.

ZETDC chief risk officer for Harare region Mr Raphael Mhasho said the cash-in-transit crew would provide tactical support and serve as additional arsenal to the members of the force at the various police stations. The kind of advanced training they received would enable them to become tactically insightful yet forcefully encounter and deal with basic criminality apart from safeguarding the company resources, he said. He said the officers would not just add to the ZETDC numbers but represented the future foundation upon which they would strengthen their Disaster Response Plan. ""This is the new kind of loss control we are building and transforming. Loss Control that will have no mercy on criminal activity but one filled with passion in protecting the organisation's resources,"" Mr Mhasho. He said the ZRP leadership would continue to ensure their members were properly trained as they believed it was a fundamental element to helping them win the war against crime. He said they needed to continuously sharpen their ammunition and arsenal, both tactically and strategically. Zesa Holdings chief loss control officer Mr Never Charles Mutengu applauded the Support Unit for training the officers saying they had the best qualified trainers. He urged the officers not to abuse the training they had acquired and end up as criminals."410,Concord Times (Freetown),6/27/13,'Massive Corruption Is an Embarrassment...',,SIERRA LEONE (97%),Newspaper,Regina Pratt,ENGLISH,,,28-Jun-13,,457 words,CORRUPTION (92%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); BANKING & FINANCE (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (89%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); CYBERCRIME (78%); BANKING & FINANCE SECTOR PERFORMANCE (77%); COMMERCIAL BANKING (72%); INTERVIEWS (71%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (63%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (57%); HOSPITALS (51%) Sierra Leone; Corruption,"National Coordinator of the Network for Peacebuilding Sierra Leone (WANEP) has described the massive fraud being uncovered by the police and the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) in the National Revenue Authority (NRA) and the banking sector as ""an embarrassment to the government, the people of Sierra Leone and the international community"". Edward Jombla, who was speaking to Concord Times on Monday in an exclusive interview, said the quantum of State resources being reported to have been allegedly stolen by public officials has the propensity of plunging the entire nation into chaos should the government fail to meet the basic needs of the people. ""Corruption triggers conflict,"" he cautioned. ""This type of naked corruption engulfing the society is unfortunate, unwarranted and not good for our fledgling democracy, especially as the government is striving hard to develop the country's economy."" Mr. Jombla urged the Koroma-administration to properly investigate all institutions alleged to have been perpetrating fraudulent activities, including the Bank of Sierra Leone. ""Losing billions of leones means a lot to social services in this country, especially in areas like health, etc. Such monies could have been used to build more hospitals across the country,"" said the WANEP national coordinator. He continued: ""These are some of the vices that caused Sierra Leone to be ranked at the bottom of the UNDP human development index for years because the country is losing huge sums of money to selfish people. This is not good for our nation in terms of development, especially as the leadership is committed to raising the resources of the State."" According to Jombla, massive corruption anywhere may lead to the crumbling of the economy of a nation, noting that such stolen money could instigate development in areas like sanitation, water and energy. ""The police should rise to the occasion by ensuring that all corrupt officials are made to face the full force of the law. The intelligence branch of the police should ensure they monitor all big business people to know how they get their resources,"" he admonished. Jombla added that he was taken aback when he heard the police referring to the current fraud case involving the NRA and the Sierra Leone Commercial Bank as ""complex suspicious financial transactions underpinned by serious fraud"", thus calling on them to improve their method of investigating cyber-crimes in the country. ""Corruption should be nipped in the bud in this country; there should be no sacred cows,"" he said. ""I don't know whether we are breeding a nation of thieves and insane people. We need a speedy trial to these offences and there should be no compromise.

A wide range of experts agree that the nature of Uganda's tax system conforms to global benchmarks. Income and corporate tax rates in Uganda are 30 per cent per annum at the highest bracket. The large gap between actual tax paid on overall earnings and expected tax to be paid on income-generating activities is worrying. This also highlights the extent of tax evasion and tax avoidance prevalent. Noteworthy is tax evasion, which is failing to file a tax return and pay taxes when they are due is illegal. If found guilty, action can be taken against the individual or organisation involved. Ironically, those engaged in tax avoidance, which involves exploiting loopholes in the law to circumvent paying some tax escape penalty, as it is not deemed to be against the law. Tax avoidance does not just occur due to those who intentionally elude paying tax. Informal sectors not captured by the tax regime alongside ignorance about tax matters contribute significantly to tax evasion. To minimise this, there are three things the government ought to do: Improve the legal framework to weed out possibilities of tax avoidance, create better incentives for tax payment and promote persuasive and far-reaching tax awareness. First, improving the legal framework to weed out possibilities of tax avoidance is the most obvious method of reducing tax avoidance. Tightening the legal framework will limit opportunities for avoiding taxes and help Uganda realise the proposed budget in the new financial year. Tax lawyers and tax consultants who make a living helping firms and individuals to ""creatively"" minimise their legal tax burden can be hired to do this. Second, creating better incentives for tax payment is equally crucial. A more creative and constructive approach would be to improve incentives for people to pay their taxes. For instance, it would work if the tax regime is re-organised so that there are tax rebates on investments in organisations which finance the government's developmental work. A key reason why citizens do not pay taxes is that they do not see any corresponding significant improvements in public services, which directly affect their lives. It is, therefore, important that new public services and improvements to existing ones cater for all segments of the population. In addition, well-meaning citizens are often  discouraged from paying taxes because of corruption. The taxpayer, seeing public money squandered, is less-disposed to contribute to this wastage. Without a doubt, we cannot expect a significant reversal in tax avoidance unless there is a visible decline in corruption among public officials. Besides, persuasive and far-reaching awareness regarding tax matters will definitely yield positive results. The key to bridging the gap between expected tax revenue and tax revenue actually collected is increasing the number of people who pay tax. Very often, lack of awareness of how taxation works and its potential benefits also contributes to this gap. This can be overcome through education on tax matters. So far, this activity has been successfully carried out but there remains a mountain to climb. Additionally, influential community leaders could play a pivotal role. Cultural and religious leaders would be more effective than politicians and civil servants in engaging the public on the importance of paying taxes for the progress of the country as well as for future generations. The fact that churches in Uganda receive religious donations amounting to over 10 per cent (tithe) of devotees' income implies that churches can be good advocates for tax payment. The belief is that churches directly benefit the person, their family and their religious fraternity. If local governments were to request assistance of the local pastor in pointing out to his church's audience how paying taxes has enabled the construction of the new road or a new dispensary in their locality, it is likely that this community would be willing to listen to their trusted source (the pastor) and act upon the advice positively. In a nutshell, developing countries may face similar tax issues to the developed world. The underlying reasons, however, are very different as are the solutions. Tax evasion is indeed a serious issue. In Uganda's case, equally important is the task of reducing tax avoidance. It is often practiced by well-meaning citizens who are disillusioned or distrustful of public financial management effectiveness, or by some who are not included in the formal economy or others who are simply misinformed about the taxation system and its potential long-term benefits. These are problems, which seem easier to solve than tax evasion but doing so needs better understanding of the local context and more creativity than the long arm of the law.

He said the force would continue to lobby for the improvement of conditions of service and remuneration for officers. ""The police, like any other Government department, does not tolerate corruption,"" he said. ""During your tour of duty, there are a lot of temptations which you will be exposed to, as professional police officers resist the urge to engage in corruption. ""Anyone caught on the wrong side of the law will be dealt with decisively. Corrupt officers will be weeded out of the force to save the public and reputation of the organisation."" Comm Gen Chihuri said poor salaries could never be an excuse for the officers to engage into corruption. He urged the officers to remain focussed and vigilant in defence of their integrity and reputation as a police force and a sovereign nation.

The regional workshop at Parliament Buildings and organised by the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the African Parliamentarian Network against Corruption (APNAC) - Rwanda, sought to underscore the understanding of the role of Parliaments in promoting good financial governance and fighting corruption. More than 100 participants, including Rwandan lawmakers, APNAC National Chapter representatives from East African Community, heads of EAC anti-corruption authorities, and APNAC executive committee members, attended the workshop. The Chairperson of APNAC-Rwanda, Sen. Marie Claire Mukasine, said: ""APNAC-Rwanda shall make the most of this opportunity which is certain to become a cornerstone of a sharpened partnership between AfDB and APNAC on both a continental and regional level but which will be particularly valuable to APNAC in the fight against corruption."" Jacob Diko Mukete, from the AfDB's governance department, told the initial session that addressing corruption continues to be one of the greatest challenges facing the continent. Mukete, who is the manager for economical and financial reform at the continental bank, said the workshop presented a huge opportunity to participants to share best practices. ""The cost of corruption can be measured in terms of the opportunity cost of the huge quantity of scarce resource leakages from the public coffers. Imagine if those billions, or millions of dollars, were spent on the construction of bridges, schools and roads, and other investments!"" Mukete said. The former AfDB Resident Representative told the session that Rwanda has risen from the ashes because of its tough zero-tolerance policy to corruption which has attracted high investments. President of the Senate, Dr Jean Damascene Ntawukuliryayo, urged the participants to learn from Rwanda since it is leading in the fight against corruption, good governance and transparency. ""Rwanda is now in the fourth position on the continent - in the east African region, Rwanda is number one. All this was possible because of the good leadership of our country,"" Dr Ntawukuliryayo said. ""One of the secrets that enabled us to arrive at where we are today is the political will by the leaders of the Rwandan nation.""

""Government will not encourage such people as their activities undermine the integrity of the state and the good work of President Ernest Bai Koroma and his vision to develop the country,"" said Mr. Bayraytay. Government, he added, has given the Anti-Corruption Commission and the Judiciary the latitude of independence to operate and that they are committed to ensuring that all those found wanting of corruption acts face the full force of the law. According to Bayraytay, most funds being used in infrastructural development were locally generated, noting that the action of corrupt people will scare donors from continuing to provide more funds towards the country's development efforts. ""People have the audacity to divert funds that are meant for the development of the country to their personal use. After the legal process, if it gives cause for them to be sent to prison, so be it,"" he said.

When the CIID chief, Ms Grace Akullo, last year started investigations into the financial misappropriation in the Office of the Prime Minister, she was determined to bring the culprits to book; she set out her dogs. They went on a good mission. But the Sunday Monitor's Chris Obore, in this analysis, looks at how the investigations boss could have failed to read the interests of her bosses and pressed a self-destruct button. Police investigations into fraud scadals in the Office of the Prime Minister [OPM] and other ministries have been hit by a fight between technocrats and investigators. Politicians are fueling it. New reports suggest that the head of Crime Intelligence and Investigations Directorate, Ms Grace Akullo, who led the hunt against suspected fraudsters, is now facing several probes against her over the manner in which she handled investigations.Both Ms Akullo and Mr Pius Bigirimana (former OPM permanent secretary) vehemently refused any discussion on the subject when the Sunday Monitor sounded them out.""Please my name has been everywhere, I don't want it anymore,"" said Mr Bigirimana while Ms Akullo said she had been accused of dealing with the media.The scandal in the OPM, in which at least Sh60 billion was stolen, has got the prime suspect, Godfrey Kazinda, a five year-jail term. The accountant has since appealed against the sentence.Other trials over the scam are ongoing at the Anti-Corruption Court. The OPM scandal, although not the biggest theft so far witnessed, attracted robust public debate after donors pulled the strings. They would in the subsequent days tighten the financial taps to Uganda, leaving the taxpayer with a staring budget to finance. Of the more than Shs60 billion meant for Peace, Recovery and Development Programme (PRDP) for war-torn northern region and Karamoja Sub-region, at least Shs33.8 billion was donors' contribution. The government refunded donor funds as a condition for further donor support.This scandal came to fore after Mr Bigirimana [who has since been transferred to Gender ministry] ""blew the whistle"" that Mr Kazinda had indulged in suspicious financial transactions. Mr Bigirimana also asked the Auditor General to carry out a forensic audit. The audit confirmed the theft which involved officials in Bank of Uganda and the Ministry of Finance. What happened?Initially, Ms Akullo and Mr Bigirimana appeared to work well and shared relevant information.However, they later disagreed over the conduct of the investigations.  The CIID chief blamed Mr Bigirimana for reportedly trying to shield some of the OPM staff whom she needed to interrogate. In Ms Akullo's view, according to our investigations, to get to the bottom of the theft, police needed to question all the players. Mr Bigirimana accused Ms Akullo of derailing investigations by not focusing it. According to Mr Bigirimana, the Auditor General had carried out technical investigations, therefore; police should work to prove the findings of the AG with a view to prosecute those involved.  He thought that police lacked technical ability to examine financial documents. Both insisted on their line of thought.At this point, there were already public calls for Mr Bigirimana to resign from his job. The demand was so intense that it got Mr Bigirimana agitated. The police intensified their visits to OPM and asking civil servants to account for monies they received for any work in OPM.Mr Bigirimana petitioned the police chief, Gen Kale Kayihura, saying Ms Akullo was disrupting work instead of investigating the theft. He blamed her for reportedly going for junior staff while trying to protect the fraud architects. Our sources familiar with the whole saga saythe police chief would intervene by asking Ms Akullo to listen to Mr Bigirimana.However, Ms Akullo threatened to resign if she was not allowed to interrogate all the OPM staff involved, including Mr Bigirimana. Gen Kayihura was stunned by this and reportedly took a laid-back role.It turned into a turf war between Ms Akullo and Mr Bigirimana.  Ms Akullo vowed to leave no stone unturned while Mr Bigirimana said he would not allow police to victimise all workers under him. Police continued to raid OPM and dragging staffers to Crime Intelligence directorate at Kireka. The staffers accused police of using the probe to extract bribes from them.At this time, the internal wrangles in OPM came to fore. Staffers wrote several anonymous dossiers to police, revealing what they said was rot in the OPM and blamed it on Mr Bigirimana. But Mr Bigirimana insisted that the dossiers were part of the campaign to derail the investigators from focusing on the culprits. The police were accused of taking bribes from Mr Kazinda and his co-accused. This incensed Ms Akullo who blamed it on Mr Bigirimana but the PS was also enraged by allegations of incompetence and cover-up. Museveni gets into the mixThe matter failed to be resolved by Gen Kayihura especially because while he tried to mediate between the two, they also reached President Museveni individually. At times, Mr Museveni personally called each of the two separately to get their views. He also gave each of them different instructions.While the police was doing their job, Mr Museveni also asked Special Forces intelligence to investigate both Ms Akullo and Mr Bigirimana. He would not tell them his parallel findings but sources say Mr Museveni faulted the Auditor General for having not unearthed the theft earlier. This is what informed his defence of Mr Bigirimana as a whistle-blower. He reportedly wanted Ms Akullo to liaise with Mr Bigirimana but would not say it directly to her. After all, the two had already developed an icy relationship.  But to appear on the good books of the President, both Ms Akullo and Mr Bigirimana called Mr Museveni regularly to plead their cases.The operation concentrated between the President, Gen Kayihura, Ms Akullo and Mr Bigirimana with back-up from Special Forces Guard. But Mr Museveni was clearly inclined to Mr Bigirimana's side yet he reportedly continued to encourage Ms Akullo to do her work without fear or favour; and report to him any obstacles. In meetings, he would refer to her as 'my daughter'.The President reportedly pleaded with Ms Akullo to help him ""catch all the thieves that are diverting money he would have used to develop infrastructure."" On the basis of this presidential ""backing"", Ms Akullo reportedly updated Mr Museveni constantly. Sometimes she would reportedly reach the President without Gen Kayihura's clearance. This appears to be one of the strategic blunders on her part.Mr Museveni would summon Ms Akullo to State House to brief him. But he would also alert the accused to turn up without Ms Akullo's knowledge. Two of such meetings turned ugly as Ms Akullo faced the people she was investigating right before the President. Some of the suspects accused Ms Akullo of not understanding government bureaucracy and carrying out investigations in the media with a view to embarrass civil servants. The CIID chief was particularly accused of reportedly tipping journalists on who would appear at CIID for interrogation.  The bureaucrats argued that police investigations should have been discreet because not everyone summoned to police was guilty yet the media coverage created an impression that all of them were thieves. They told Mr Museveni that, for that reason, the civil servants were disinterested in helping police. Mr Bigirimana had also recorded statements from civil servants who reportedly confessed having given money to police under duress. Mr Museveni assembled another team to investigate the police, including Ms Akullo. The reports of police investigators receiving bribes appeared to carry meaning because at one point, Ms Akullo faced a crisis after most of her team gave excuses for not turning up to work. Allegations are that after receiving bribes, some detectives faked family problems and failed to report to work forcing Ms Akullo to keep reshuffling her team. Mr Museveni was disturbed by Ms Akullo's alleged media involvement in her work and the detectives profiteering from the scandal. Ms Akullo had also been accused of attempting to exonerate Mr Kazinda.But in most of her reports to Mr Museveni, the CIID chief mentioned Mr Bigirimana as a major obstacle to speedy investigations yet the donors needed to see action taken against the suspects before they could loosen the financial taps. She also spoke against Ms Flavia Waduwa, the undersecretary for Pacification.It would appear Ms Akullo failed to read Mr Museveni's mind. Sources say he urged her to work with Mr Bigirimana to catch the thieves then she could later investigate him if he had a case but the CIID chief insisted on treating the PS as a suspect. She reportedly argued that without Mr Bigirimana, there would be no successful prosecutions. Ms Akullo appeared to sell her strategy to a subtly unwilling customer [Museveni]. Politics at playApparently, when the scandal became fodder for public commentators, it also brought out the internal political dynamics in the ruling NRM party. Sections of the party leaders took sides with public servants. The MPs were drawn in. Reports of money being used to further political ambitions of rival camps added flavour to the debate. The ministers under OPM were divided between the Kazinda and Bigirimana's camps. Interestingly, the ministers who reportedly received weekend ""fuel"" from Kazinda became his defenders while those who got from Mr Bigirimana, supported him all through. Some resorted to trading information from one camp to another in return for 'inducements'.Mr Bigirimana sold the view that financial loss in the government was not limited to OPM and that it was rush for police to pronounce him a suspect. He said he had bust the racket which involved Ministry of Finance and Bank of Uganda, therefore; police should treat him as a witness. Mr Museveni's parallel investigators found some merit in Mr Bigirimana's allegations. And on February 17, 2008, the Sunday Monitor also published an article titled: Exposed: Money racket in govt, which exposed how the Integrated Financial Management System [IFMS] had been abused by a racket of civil servants. At that time, bureaucrats charged with managing the system, used it to create false suppliers and paid out billions of money to them. They targeted ministries with big budgets like Works, Health and Education. In one of the fake payments, Ministry of Works lost Shs542 million. The PS then was threatened that he would host bullets in his body if he fought the culprits. Fast forwardBuoyed by reports from Ministry of Finance that local revenue could finance the national budget, Mr Museveni was reluctant to succumb to donor pressure to refund the money and sack Mr Bigirimana. It was only later when he consulted URA boss Allen Kagina that it dawned on him that he had been misled. URA's collections wouldn't meet the budget demands. He immediately ordered for the refund of the donor funds to soothe the enraged development partners. To calm them further, he later moved Mr Bigirimana away from OPM. The final strawThe arrest of Ms Waduwa galvanized civil servants. Police wrote through Mr Bigirimana asking Waduwa to report to CIID headquarters and to carry with her all documents about PRDP. Mr Bigirimana wrote back to police asking them to specify which documents Ms Waduwa should carry because as accounting officer, he would not allow all OPM accountability to be taken to police.The police never specified. Instead they stormed OPM to arrest Ms Waduwa, accusing her of ignoring police summons. She was tipped. Ms Waduwa sneaked out of her office and drove to CIID. On arrival, she was arrested. The media captured the drama. Ms Waduwa was to spend a night in police cells but Gen Kayihura ordered for her release after Mr Bigirimana's intervention.Ms Waduwa raised a complaint to head of Public Service accusing police of persecution. She argued that she had not ignored police summons but that she was summoned through the PS, therefore; she couldn't carry OPM documents to police without clearance from her boss as per public service standing orders.She pleaded that police action was aimed at having her name in the media in bad faith.  The head of Public Service, John Mitala, wrote the Gen Kayihura asking him to investigate what he described as disturbing issues.Sources say President Museveni also received petitions from senior civil servants against Ms Akullo. He reportedly asked IGG to investigate. Sources say IGG has written to Ms Akullo to answer to the allegations against her work methods.The IGG acknowledges receipt of the petitions but wouldn't discuss the details. Ms Akullo emphatically declined to discuss the matter in spite of our several attempts. ""You analyse the situation your way. Surely I have no comment; can I fight corruption alone? There is a lot that could be going on.""Sources, however, say she is deflated and says only God will be her protector.  Apparently, the CIID boss believes she has become a target especially after the PS Health Asuman Lukwago alleged that police tried to poison him. Mr Lukwago is also at war with Ms Akullo over fraud related investigations.Since the confusion generated by the OPM scandal, Ms Akullo's speed has slowed down yet there is still the pension scandal to prosecute, the Ministry of Local Government theft and Ministry of Trade among others. The hunter's [Akullo] morale appears dim partly because the hunted are equally on her trail. And the chance to dig into theft of money in the government could be blown away! What experts said about Bigirimana's role Last month, this newspaper reported that more than Shs8 billion stolen from the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) was taken using the forged signature of Mr Pius Bigirimana, according to findings of a South African fraud expert. Mr Bigirimana, the former permanent secretary at OPM, has been moved to the Gender Ministry.In a confidential letter to the Minister of Finance, Ms Maria Kiwanuka, which is copied to the deputy governor of Bank of Uganda (BoU), Mr Louis Kasekende, the governor, Mr Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile, reveals that the bank engaged an independent South African consultant to examine the OPM financial documents ""after some signatories disowned signatures on the documents against which payments were effected"". Among the findings, he said, of the 120 documents cashed by BoU, only 21 of them had Mr Bigirimana's genuine signature.On five documents amounting to Shs1.14 billion, the BoU consultant was unable to tell whether the signatures were forged or not. At least 19 of the documents amounting to Shs1.9 billion were signed by the undersecretary, Ms Flavia Waduwa, but five of them amounting to Shs307 million reportedly had Ms Waduwa's forged signature. The CIID boss whose work exposed her to trouble Ms Akullo has served the Uganda Police Force for more than 10 years, but she only became famous a year ago when she took on high-profile corruption cases, her first case involving Godfrey Kazinda, a former principal accountant in the Office of the Prime Minister.The CIID boss is said to have raised 13 children, four biological, three steps and six adopted, a thing which she has laced her work with - treating all detectives as her own children. When you enter her office, the motherliness is evident - a picture or two of her children occupy the walls.Even on a busy day, at 6pm, she has to pick one of her children from school. She proudly talks of her children, hinting on how she will go an extra mile to ensure that all her children have equal privilege.Unlike many people in her position, Akullo takes time to ask all those queued up at her office what their concerns are. Although her schedule is tight, the CIID director knows that people need her help and she assigns detectives to help solve their problems or direct them to concerned offices.Akullo is a jolly lady, who talks loudly, her words not necessarily emphasising her authority and for each complaint or point made, she has a story to tell and she will narrate the stories in brief.

The two-day conference that is underway in Kigali has attracted regional government officials and experts. The meeting is being held under the theme: ""Sustaining the fight against corruption to promote regional integration."" Speaking at the opening of the meeting, the Speaker of Parliament, Rose Mukantabana, said a regional approach towards fighting graft is the only appropriate way of eliminating, or at least minimising the vice. ""To achieve a successful regional integration and sustainable development, it is imperative for EAC partner states to develop regional standards and principles that they will abide by to sustain the fight against corruption,"" Mukantabana said. The Speaker urged the five EAC partner States to entrench the culture of transparency among regional citizens, saying this will be a great tool in fighting graft. ""In order to attain a prosperous, competitive, secure, stable and politically united East Africa, issues of ethics, transparency and accountability have to be treated with utmost seriousness,"" she said ""It is the only way that the EAC's mission of improving the quality of life of East Africans through increased competitiveness, value added production, trade and investment would be achieved."" It's estimated that in Africa, more than $148 billion is lost annually to corruption and other graft-related vices, with perpetrators of corruption shipping the loot off to banks in the developed world. Africa lost up to $1.4 trillion between 1980 and 2009 to illicit outflows, according to a joint report by the African Development Bank and advocacy group Global Financial Integrity. Monique Mukaruliza, the minister for EAC affairs, told the participants that it would be hard for good governance to develop in the region if the countries do not collaborate. ""Democratic governance in East Africa requires continuous and consistent nurturing. There is a lot more work to be done in strengthening institutions and oversight mechanisms that are often referred to as the ""hardware and software"" of good governance,"" said the minister. Miria Matembe, a former minister for ethics and integrity in Uganda, said greed for wealth and hunger for power is the major cause of corruption in the region. She advised partner states to first realise that they are corrupt and after accepting the reality draw mechanisms to fight the vice. ""There is need for personal will if the war on corruption is to be won, don't look at others as the corrupt ones only but rather check yourself. For instance, when your relatives are arrested over corruption-related cases, you go as far as bribing authorities to release them,"" Matembe said. The East African Bribery Index 2012 launched in Kampala, last year, ranked Rwanda the least corrupt country, followed by Tanzania and Kenya in second and third positions, respectively. Burundi was fourth and Uganda trailed. Rwanda has a bribery aggregate index of 2.5 per cent. Burundi, the worst ranked country in 2011, recorded a significantly lower index of 18.8 per cent; Kenya and Tanzania were 29.5 per cent and 39.1 per cent, respectively, while Uganda registered the highest bribery levels in the region with a percentage value of 40.7 per cent. Corruption also hinders the transporters in region since some are forced to pay a bribe on the highways, officials say."419,New Democrat (Monrovia),7/9/13,Corruption Casualties - Five Officials Axed,,LIBERIA (93%); GHANA (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,11-Jul-13,,652 words,LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (90%); AUDITS (90%); ACCOUNTING (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); CORRUPTION (89%); PUBLIC CONTRACTS LAW (89%); CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (89%); DISMISSALS (78%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (78%); SUITS & CLAIMS (77%); WAGES & SALARIES (74%); JOURNALISM (72%); DOCUMENTARY FILMS (72%); INTELLIGENCE SERVICES (72%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (70%); SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES (69%); FLEET MANAGEMENT (67%); CONTRACT AWARDS (67%); IMMIGRATION (64%); NATIONAL SECURITY (64%); WRITERS (63%); TERRORISM (62%); COUNTERTERRORISM (62%); CONSTRUCTION (61%); RELIGION (50%); HUMAN TRAFFICKING (50%) Liberia; Corruption,"In an attempt to continue her corruption fight, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has dismissed the Auditor-General of the General Auditing Commission (GAC), Robert Kilby and the Director-General of the General Services Agency (GSA), Ms. Pearine Davis-Parkinson, for non-compliance with or violation of public financial management and procurement laws. The action came after Madam Parkinson last week unveiled a conflict of interest in the function of Auditor General Robert Kilby, who was initially rejected by the Senate for presenting fake credentials. After getting the overnight confirmation following his second appearance before the senate, Kilby took over the GAC but soon came under pressure for dismissing 41 employees and replacing them with 69 others with huge salary payment. Ms. Parkinson told members of the Ways, Means and Finance Committee at the hearing that GSA signed and entered into a contact with Mr. Kilby's accounting firm to carry out assets and fleet management, tracking and reporting system at the GSA. There are reports that the contract was entered into on the 3rd of December 2012 between the GSA and an independent Software Certification Company, own by Mr. Robert Kilby three months after he took over the GAC on September 3, 2012. Making the announcement on local radio stations the president also dismissed The Deputy Minister of Justice for Administration and Public Safety, Col. Freddie Taylor, the Deputy Commissioner of the Bureau of Immigration for Operations, Mr. Robert Budy and the Director of Border Management, Cllr. Wilson Garpeh for their alleged involvement in human trafficking. As relative of former Liberian President Charles, Freddie Taylor served as Director of the National Security Agency during the regime of the former leader. Under the administration of Mr. Taylor, five journalists fled into Ghana after the NSA investigated them for a story the paper carried on the failure of the former NSA chief to investigate the killing of over 25 Muslims by the disbanded Anti-Terrorist Unit (ATU) in Lofa County. The president also suspended, pending an investigation, the Deputy Minister for Public Works for Operations, Mr. Victor Smith, for failure to adhere to the public procurement and financial rules relative to the awarding of construction contracts. In a brief nationwide address the president said after reviewing documentary evidence, ""I am today formally requesting the concurrence of the Honorable Legislature to dismiss the Auditor General, Robert Kilby, for failure to disclose private business activities that represent a clear conflict of interest with his official duties as Head of the institution with prime responsibility to investigate and advise on non-compliance with our public financial management and procurement laws."" She said she will communicate to the Legislature the causes of his dismissal shortly. But contacted, the House acknowledged receipt of the communication telling our reporter that they have begun acting on it. The Liberian leader has also dismissed the Director General of the GSA, Ms. Pearine Davis-Parkinson, who approved those contracts in violation of the country's procurement laws and procedures. She has instructed a team headed by the Minister of Labor to conduct further investigation on additional measures that may be taken against the former Solicitor General, Cllr. Michael Wright, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization and others. The Executive Mansion release did not give details of the cases the Labor Minister is to investigate against the former Solicitor General, Immigration chief and the Indian Consul. The Liberian leader has also suspended, pending an investigation, the Deputy Minister for Public Works for Operations, Mr. Victor Smith, for failure to adhere to the public procurement and financial rules of the Government as relates to the award of construction contracts."420,The New Times (Kigali),7/11/13,EAC States Need Collective Action Against Corruption,,AFRICA (96%); RWANDA (93%); EASTERN AFRICA (93%); SUDAN (73%) East Africa,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,11-Jul-13,"KIGALI, RWANDA (72%)",337 words,CORRUPTION (94%); TRENDS (78%); BEST PRACTICES (78%); RANKINGS (56%) Corruption; Governance; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Another Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer is out. And it's not good news for the East African Community (EAC) and Africa in general. The only silver lining for the bloc is that Rwanda continues its impressive, albeit solitary, strides in the battle against corruption, and is now the least corrupt country in Africa, according to the 2013 TI Barometer. Rwanda ranked in the category of countries whose corruption incidence range between 10 per cent and 14.9 per cent - the only African nation in that class. Sudan and Tunisia are the African countries that came closest to Rwanda, having scored between the 15 per cent - 19.9 per cent category. Closer to home, the majority of Rwanda's EAC partners came in a distant 50-74.9 per cent category. In the recent years, the story of the campaign against corruption among EAC partner states has been of mixed fortunes, with some countries making significant improvement, while others have practically stagnated. The TI's report came out at a time delegates from across the EAC region were in Kigali attending a conference on good governance, where talk of the worrying trends of corruption levels among the partner states was rife. Indeed, participants urged partner states to take decisive action against graft, saying it was a major impediment to the bloc's integration agenda. According to the AU, corruption costs Africa an estimated $148 billion each year. Needless to say the poor is the one who is hit the hardest. The price is too high to afford. In EAC, given the interconnectedness of our countries, it is almost impossible for one country to succeed in the battle against corruption - at least in the long-run - without the other partners playing their part. As such, the EAC members need to devise a common approach in the fight against corruption, and be willing to learn from each other in the customary spirit of sharing and replicating best practices. And the same should happen with other policies. That would be a major step towards full integration."421,The New Times (Kigali),7/11/13,Making Sense of the 2013 Global Corruption Report,,RWANDA (94%); AFRICA (94%); EASTERN AFRICA (92%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%),Newspaper,Paul Ntambara,ENGLISH,,,11-Jul-13,,597 words,CORRUPTION (93%); BRIBERY (89%); POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (78%); POLITICS (77%); POLITICAL PARTIES (73%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (73%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (72%); RELIGION (50%) Rwanda; Corruption; International Organizations and Africa; Governance,"Rwanda has yet again been ranked as a high flyer in ensuring a corruption free society. This is according to the report dubbed; The Global Corruption Barometer 2013 produced by Transparency International. The findings mainly based on public opinion on corruption, shows that Rwanda is the only African country in a group of countries where corruption ranges between 10 and 14.9 per cent. It is the least corrupt country in Africa and by extension in the East African Community. This is great news worth celebrating with a gig (as my West African brothers would do). Many would argue that public opinion is not 'scientific' enough to paint a clear corruption picture of any country but it doesn't take away the fact that it is one of the ways especially if the respondents have not been influenced in one way or the other. It's the local person who dishes out a bribe in exchange for a service or a favour so public opinion should be given the weight it deserves. The findings should be seen as vindication of government's strong stance against corruption. With the prevailing political will to root out corruption in all its manifestations, these findings should not come by surprise. The findings in this report however come with a twist. Institutions that should be at the forefront of fighting corruption have a poor rating. The Police and the Judiciary are seen as the most corrupt institutions in the country respectively. Interestingly, the two institutions (Police and Judiciary) are considered in the same negative light in all the five East African Countries albeit at different levels. Low level of corruption is reported with Public officials and servants, NGOs, business, education system, religious bodies, media, political parties, medical services, military and parliament. So what do we take from this report? The most important thing is that the public court of opinion has passed its judgment. The onus now lies on institutions like the Police and the Judiciary to put their houses in order other than going on the defensive. Achieving zero corruption levels is utopia but this should not deter efforts to bring it down to the lowest level it can ever be. This report also comes with an added business meaning to Rwanda. The country is positioning itself as a leading investment destination in the region so this report only comes as a shot in the arm to this aspiration. The consequences of corruption need not to be over emphasised. Corruption has come as another undesirable challenge that businesses are faced with especially in many developing countries. A 'kitu kidogo' (bribe) has to be handed out at the land registry, at the customs and hands have to be 'oiled' at the permit office to speed up the process. The growth of such businesses is compromised as a result. Long term investment is traded for short term benefits. For Rwanda to have an edge over its EAC counterparts in attracting Foreign Direct Investment, it will have to offer much more including but not limited to low levels of corruption, something that is lacking in these countries according to the Global Corruption Barometer 2013. This will call for sustained efforts to curb this vice in all its manifestations. The 'closed' nature of the Rwandan society is counter productive to the fight against corruption. People need to speak out loud. The legal framework is in place, institutions like the office of the Ombudsman have been established, anti-corruption committees have been rolled out up to the lowest levels of administration and enforcement is at its peak. It is not yet time to rest on our laurels."422,The New Times (Kigali),7/12/13,Rwanda Can Be Tops in Corruption-Cleanliness [opinion],,RWANDA (94%); AFRICA (90%); NORTHERN ASIA (79%),Newspaper,Pan Butamire,ENGLISH,,,12-Jul-13,,775 words,"CORRUPTION (93%); BRIBERY (89%) Rwanda; Corruption; Economy, Business and Finance; Governance","This year's Transparency International corruption index report has been commented on and I need not belabour the point. However, in view of the great effort the government of Rwanda invests in fighting corruption, it is worth re-examination by all who care. In good performance in all fields, Rwanda strives to be a global leader. Why, then, isn't she, in some areas? As an example, in the fight against corruption, why does she lead African countries and not the globe? It may be argued that 19 years of self-reinvention are not enough for a country to grow forceful institutions that can insure overall success. However, personally, I think Rwanda possesses the strongest requisite weapons. She has a government with a strong will to win. The citizenry has been awakened to its need and right to own the fight. Strong laws are in place and the government makes sure they are strictly adhered to. And, don't forget, new Rwanda has never started a war that she didn't win. In a word, she has Agaciro! That Agaciro is the will to dare. To dare earn self-respect and hope for eventual self-sustenance. To best-perform; to sit at the high table. And to ignore anyone who may think there are powers that be that alone are entitled to claim ownership of that table. It's to believe that all wo/men are equal. That, like anyone else, you can make the best out of yourself. So, shoddy philosophy apart, I'm saying that Rwandans should not be happy when they are in anyway second-rated. Or that they've been placed first in Africa. Or that their bribery rate is at 13%, when recently corruption-rife Georgia, neighbour to Russia, is at 5%. Australia, S. Korea, Malaysia, Norway....why should they do better? Whether you like it or not, being second rate is a negation of Agaciro. It is Agasuzuguro. It is self-denigration and denigration of others. To accept that bribery exists even if in small measure is to accept abuse. To give someone a bribe is to belittle them. To accept a bribe is to belittle one-self. To favour anyone in any way or to solicit a favour of any kind, both are Agasuzuguro. And this Agasuzuguro exists in Rwanda, unfortunately, and I've been witness to it - hoping the long arm of the law does not reach for me! Just the other day a friend who'd given me a lift stopped for a minute to pick his mechanic, oblivious to the fact that the taxi-stop had been shifted to another area the previous day. Immediately, a policeman seized his driving licence, ignoring his pleas that he'd not seen the sign and that he'd never repeat the mistake. We were in a hurry but it seemed the friend knew how to coax a pardon out of the policeman. The two seemed to touch hands and in a jiffy we were gone. Nave me, I'd not clicked and when the friend explained what had transpired, I walked back to check the name on his jacket. But the policeman seemed to know how to position himself in a way that you could not locate his name. This reminded me of an incident when one time I was on a long journey. When a policeman flagged me down and checked all the lights, he found one of the small plate-number lights had just blown. I assured him I'd replace it at the next shop but he'd not hear of it. He booked me and I had to travel back over 20km to the police station the following day, to recover my papers. It was when at the station they explained that the worst the road-traffic policeman should have done would've been to reprimand me that the penny dropped. I understood that he'd wanted a bribe. But that time, too, I'd not seen his name. These incidents may have involved little money but they point to why the police and the judiciary top the list of corrupt departments. When it comes to contracts, tenders, marks in education centres, employment and other areas, is it easy to assess the kind of measurable and non-measurable corruption involved? No, being first in Africa is way down the ladder and it's not like Rwanda to go for anything below the top. All creative ways must be devised to be second, not to Norway, Malaysia, S. Korea or Australia but to none. Apart from what embodies Agaciro as mentioned above, the government is highly effective in its transparency, accountability and governance. These are buoyed by the institution of the Ombudsman. From the grassroots there are corruption councils that support committees which, in turn, shore up institutions. Which is why this is not a lament but, rather, a touch of celebration. But, in addition, a reminder that, in truth, Rwandans haven't ""touched the best where it used to be"" (gukora iyo bwabaga)! When all is said and done, Rwandans have it in them to be tops of the globe. butamire.wordpress.com"423,The Daily Monitor,7/16/13,"Basajja, 250 other corruption cases halted",,UGANDA (90%),Newspaper,ANTHONY WESAKA -1,ENGLISH,,,25-Jun-14,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (90%)",420  words,CORRUPTION (92%); MAGISTRATES (91%); CONSTITUTIONAL LAW (90%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (90%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); LITIGATION (90%); PETITIONS (90%); APPEALS (88%); JURISDICTION (78%); CRIMINAL LAW (78%); LAWYERS (75%); PUBLIC EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT SYSTEMS (70%),"The Principal Judge says they are considering forming special unit to probe new graft cases following last weeks Constitutional Court ruling.

Principal Judge Yorokamu Bamwine, yesterday said the Judiciary leadership was considering establishing a 'special unit' to handle new graft cases to avoid the disruption of the justice system. Friday's ruling also halts the trial of the suspects in the Ministry of Public Service pension scam where interdicted Permanent Secretary Jimmy Lwamafa and eight others have been charged with the loss of Shs168 billion in pension payments. According to Mr Bamwine, the special unit will be set up either in Buganda Road Court, or Kololo. Mr Bamwine, who is the administrative head of the High Court and has supervisory powers over magistrate's courts, also said the ongoing cases will have to wait for the outcome of the substantive petition that is pending hearing at the Constitutional Court. On Friday, the Constitutional Court temporarily stayed the criminal proceedings currently going on in the High Court, Anti-Corruption Division and those arising from the Chief Magistrate and Magistrate Grade One attached to the Anti-Corruption Division, until a pending petition challenging its composition is heard and disposed of. The ruling followed a successful application filed by city lawyer Davis Wesley Tusingwire, who was seeking the orders and declarations to effect that the exercise of the judicial duties in the Anti-Corruption Division of the High Court by the Chief Magistrate and Grade One are unconstitutional. Mr Bamwine yesterday appealed to the Constitutional Court to treat the pending substantive petition with utmost urgency bearing in mind that there are some suspects on remand at Luzira prison.

The Chief Justice was yesterday speaking at a news briefing in Kigali, where he attributed the Judiciary's poor ranking to the nature of the sector itself, saying most people who lose cases allege that judges are corrupt.

The report said Sudan and Tunisia follow as the second with scores of between 15-19.9 per cent. At the release of the report, the Executive Director of TI-Rwanda, Apollinaire Mupiganyi, said government's involvement of citizens in the fight against corruption as well as setting up anti-graft institutions such as the Office of the Ombudsman and government's anti-corruption committees had proved effective. ""The more interaction between the service provider and the client the more temptations to bribery, but there is hope that it will keep decreasing since people still have trust in these institutions, which is very crucial,"" Mupiganyi said. Prof. Rugege said the survey was a good barometer for the judiciary sector even if it was based on perceptions instead of facts.

But I thought as ministers, we were not clean, we were more prone to corruption temptations and I said all ministers should be careful not to attempt to steal public funds,"" the Zoology professor says, adding: ""I was asked to withdraw the statement. But I stood my ground, arguing that corruption needed to be fought across all spheres. The matter went to Cabinet and my colleagues continued to ask me to withdraw my statement but I refused."" Avenues of graft""You see, as a minister, you had all the powers to tell your permanent secretary to sign funds for any reason. And ministers were earning a paltry Shs2,500 and civil servants were taking home Shs1,000. So with all those powers and yet earning little, one would be tempted to steal. And it only needs the right minds to fight corruption,"" he says. However, the 'prophet of corruption' should or could be thanking God for enabling him to make the robust comments, for he would not have more chances to denounce corruption, when two years after his unpopular but famous utterances, he was kicked out of the National Resistance Council Cabinet. One evening in 1988, Prof Masaba, while at his home in Kololo, an upscale city suburb, tuned in to Radio Uganda for evening news. He had wanted to keep himself abreast with the daily events, but the news streams would instead leave him shocked. Prof Masaba, the announcements indicated, was among several other ministers who had been dropped barely two years after the NRC had appointed them. President Museveni had wielded his axe in a mini-reshuffle just at the infancy of the NRM regime; no surprises, therefore, that more have faced the sharp equipment 30 years down the road - and for several reasons. SurpriseBut Prof Masaba, who had previously worked as deputy director Uganda Trypasomiasis Research Organisation, Tororo, says the reshuffle fell from the clouds and to-date, the appointing authority has never explained to him why he dropped him - but he had the power to do so. ""I believe I did my work well. The Agriculture docket was collapsing but in the short time I was in-charge, we made commendable progress. We had Nswara, Rubooma firms and milk cooling plants in Western Uganda,"" he says, adding that rumours that he was dropped because of comments on corruption could be out of the way. When asked what he thinks about corruption today, the professor says: ""Corruption has eaten up the whole fabric of the State. The government is very tired, people have given up and we need change."" Prof Masaba also maintains that President Museveni can no longer fight graft. ""Frankly speaking, Museveni can't fight corruption. The 26 years for him in power are enough. He can no longer add value to the government. We need a new face even if it is from NRM but with a better style of management."" So is the Makerere University Zoology professor until 2007, lost for options outside NRM? No, he says. The country has very few clean people now, but Besigye [Rtd. Col. Kizza] is a very committed man. If he became president, things would be better, Prof Masaba, a father of six, adds. Church silentHe, however, throws barbs at one of the groups that he thinks can be relevant in fighting graft and bad governance but have shut up.""There is a conspiracy between the Church and politicians. The Church should be instrumental in denouncing bad governance and defending the poor. But today, most church leaders have kept mum and are dining with politicians, which is very absurd for a country like ours"". Another way to institute better management of the State, according to the teacher-cum politician, is by trimming the overgrown Cabinet to 25 ministers with assistant ministers. Prof Masaba says today, we have very many ministers who are not performing, yet the taxpayer breaks to foot their heavy salaries. The educationist adds that districts are so many yet the government cannot cater for them and that President Museveni is misdirecting resources.He, however, credits the regime for relative peace compared to the previous governments. ""Security is better today. I remember in 1971 while I was in-charge of East Acholi, now Kitgum District [was made acting District Commissioner of Kitgum later], I met a lorry full of people who waved to me. But when I got to a public gathering I was going to address, residents told me Langi and Acholi had been killed and carried in that lorry,"" he says as he stares into the green Kapchorwa countryside. But the professor takes an exception to the way opposition leaders are treated, saying people should be given freedom of expression and that tear gas should not be misused. So did he fall out with the regime after being dropped from Cabinet more than 20 years ago? No, he says: ""I have actually never been in NRM. When Museveni was starting his government, he just chose individuals and that is how I ended up in the Cabinet."" Joining FDCCould President Museveni have sensed an element of rebellion in the Zoology guru then? Only insight can answer that, but Prof Masaba later joined the country's largest opposition party, the Forum for Democratic Change, whose ticket he used to contest the Tingey MP seat in 2006. Ironically, Prof Masaba, who should have been celebrating his 64th birthday and victory on February 23, 2006, instead was crest fallen after he lost the election to Herbert Sabila Mugi of the NRM. He has been out of politics but never out of giving services to the community. Prof Masaba in 2001 started a secondary school in Kapchorwa Town with 128 students. Today, Town View Secondary School boasts of more than 1,000 students; with hundreds others having gone through university education.He is also a farmer with several cattle, and crop plantations. For a man who foresaw corruption when the regime was barely out of its nappies, you can only imagine want pain he nurses when corruption is all and about. Such is what Prof Masaba warned about two decades ago, a rare characteristic then and now, and he is yet to loosen his principals; he could have read the bold signs of corruption! He is that breed, then, that is rare to stumble upon.

The Rubavu Intermediate Court convicted him of corruption. He was sentenced to one year in prison. Fred Gahizi, a Police officer, trained to keep law and order found himself on the wrong side of the law he took oath to protect. But he fell for a bribe. He was arrested and charged for corruption. A tribunal sitting in Nyakabuye convicted him of corruption and sentenced him to 2 years and six months in prison. He was also fined Rw60, 000, plus an automatic dishonourable discharge. These are some of the 28 persons definitely convicted for corruption in the first quarter of 2013, according to the list-of-shame released by the Office of the Ombudsman, and published in this newspaper on July 29. Persons convicted are of diverse professions; farmers, drivers, police officers, civil servants, among other trades. The lowest amount involved in all these corruption cases is Rwf1,000 (less than US$2) with the highest at Rwf400,000 (about Rwf$600) attracting jail sentences of between six months to 5 years. The issue of corruption is attracting growing attention by the day and this country has not wavered in the fight against the vice, even with all the international accolades it has won on this issue. The Government has come out strongly in its condemnation of corrupt tendencies in the public and private sector. The establishment of institutions like the Office of the Ombudsman, the Office of the Auditor General, and the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee, is seen as a strong resolve to tackle corruption across the board. It is this resolve from the top that has inspired Rwandans to talk about corruption just like they would about the weather. Students in the anti-corruption clubs and local people in their village anti-corruption committees are all talking about the 'monster' that is corruption. Results have been impressive, the recent Corruption Perception Index ranked Rwanda as the least corrupt country on the continent. The just released 2012 Governance Scorecard by the Rwanda Governance Board rates the fight against corruption, ensuring transparency and accountability up there, at 77.1 per cent. But as the citizens talk, the challenge is how to walk the talk, especially in prosecuting persons involved in corruption cases. This is what makes the publication of the list of persons convicted of corruption a good practice. While the number of convicted persons seems small, the significant of publishing names of convicted persons is not lost. The message from the Office of the Ombudsman is that no one is immune to the long arm of the law; from a local farmer and businessman to a local government official and the police officer. However, a telling observation from the list of shame is the small amount of money involved (ranging between Rwf1, 000 and Rwf400, 000) and the people involved (farmers, drivers). It would be foolhardy to bury our heads in the sand and believe that corruption only exists at the lower levels and only small amounts of money change hands. If the purpose of the publication of the list of persons definitely convicted of corruption is to serve as a truly deterrent measure, we should be able to see persons involved in high-profile corruption cases published on the same list. We have had many cases where senior officials have been arrested and later convicted of corruption. And they have gone on to serve their respective sentences. But they, too, for the same of farness, should be on the same list-of-shame the Office of Ombudsman eventually makes public. And it is not that all is well at the top. As the Ombudsman Aloysia Cyanzayire has once stated, corruption at the higher levels is much more sophisticated, sometimes involving third parties. The judicial system needs to be strengthened to ensure a high conviction rate for corruption-related cases involving large amounts of taxpayers' money. A well facilitated an anti-corruption court should be considered to ensure speedy trial of corruption-related cases, and it should be empowered to detect all the sophistication that comes with high-profile graft cases. If this is done, the message would be loud and clear that no matter your station in life, corruption in all its manifestations is a crime that is punished under the laws of the land."430,The New Times (Kigali),8/4/13,Nyamasheke Official Accused of Corruption,,RWANDA (93%),Newspaper,Jean De La Croix Tabaro,ENGLISH,,,5-Aug-13,"KIGALI, RWANDA (79%)",360 words,CORRUPTION (90%); BRIBERY (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); CIVIL SERVICES (78%); ARRESTS (73%); CRIMINAL LAW (73%) Rwanda; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Governance,"The Executive Secretary of Nyamasheke District in Western Province, Jean Pierre Ndagijimana, is being questioned in Nyarugenge Intermediate Court over charges that he tried to bribe an official at the Office of the Ombudsman to cover up a false declaration of his wealth. Police on Friday filed the corruption case after the official was caught red-handed following complaints and tips from the Office of the Ombudsman, the police spokesperson Theos Badege said on Friday. Badege said they are accusing him of bribing, which is punished by article 641 of the Rwandan penal code. According to Jean Pierre Nkurunziza, the spokesman of the Office of the Ombudsman, the official was caught while bribing a staff of the office of the Ombudsman with Rwf 800,000 in a deal of Rwf 1.5million. The idea to bribe, he said, came after Ndagijimana had lied during declaration of assets and wanted the staff to cover him. The staff notified his office about the issue and they started dealing with the police to arrest him the day of receiving the bribe. The deal took place in Kigali and the police was notified; thus they found him while counting the first instalment to give. ""The deal was such that he was to give Rwf800,000 in that very morning on Friday, Rwf 200,000 in the evening and then the rest would be paid after the issue to pursue him (over false declaration of wealth) would seem to rest,"" Nkurunziza said. Nkurunziza said that a concerned citizen in Nyamasheke had disclosed that the official had registered many of his assets under other people's names during the Ombudsman's annual exercise of declaration of assets which aims at fighting corruption among civil servants. The Office of the ombudsman started investigations and was able to confirm that the official indeed had other assets that he did not declare, Nkurunziza said. ""We would not disclose which assets are concerned since it would hamper investigations. All we realized is that he had registered some of his assets on other people which is suspicious,"" he said. Ndagijimana's questioning will continue tomorrow, the spokesperson of the Rwandan Prosecution, Alain Mukuralinda, revealed over the weekend."431,The New Times (Kigali),8/5/13,Transparency Rwanda Wants Sex Based Corruption Criminalised,,RWANDA (94%); AFRICA (73%),Newspaper,Maria Kaitesi,ENGLISH,,,5-Aug-13,,375 words,LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); WAGES & SALARIES (90%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (90%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (90%); CHILDREN (89%); WOMEN WORKERS (78%); PARENTING (78%); EMPLOYMENT (78%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (74%); RELIGION (50%) Rwanda; International Organizations and Africa; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Asking for sexual favours in exchange for jobs and salary increment should be criminalised, Transparency Rwanda, a non-profit non-governmental organisation, has said. Speaking at a workshop at Parliament on Friday, Francine Umurungi, the in charge of institutional development and advocacy at Transparency Rwanda said there are so many cases of sex-based corruption in Rwanda yet there is no legal provisions that condemn it so most offenders go unpunished. According to Umurungi, this is one of the most ignored types of corruption yet its rampant in society. Without giving figures, Umurungi shared with the Parliamentarians a video of people testifying as having been victims of sex based violence. Some included students, housemaids and employees who were allegedly asked for sexual favours by their bosses or teachers in exchange for good grades, job placements or salary increments. Other cases she cited involved drivers whose female bosses demanded sex in order to keep or get jobs. ""We know so many cases but the biggest challenge is that there is no specific law that penalises sex based on corruption yet most of the other forms of corruption have stringent laws in place. We are meeting with lawmakers and other stakeholders to raise awareness and call for action against this form of corruption,"" she said. Umurungi also stated that they will soon meet with officials from ministries and private sector to raise awareness and call for action. It is a big issue in our society which requires everyone to play a role in order to curb it, Marie Immaculate Ingabire, the Chairperson of Transparency Rwanda said. She called upon parents to improveon their parenting role to enlighten children on their rights and values. Ingabire warned parents not to give their children excess freedom which they might abuse but instead raise them as responsible and enlightened citizens. ""Religious leaders should also preach against and condemn such evils as sex based corruption. The culprits must not go unpunished so they can serve as examples to other people,"" she said. Senator Tito Rutaremara urged parliamentarians to play a major role in helping to stem the vice. Parliament shouldn't leave this to other players but should also do something about it, he said."432,Addis Fortune,8/11/13,High Profile Corruption Case Finally to Go to Court,,ETHIOPIA (93%),Newspaper,Elleni Araya,ENGLISH,,,13-Aug-13,,689 words,"CORRUPTION (92%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); PUBLIC FINANCE (90%); EXCISE & CUSTOMS (90%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (90%); TAX AUTHORITIES (89%); TAX LAW (89%); BAIL (89%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (89%); TAX ENFORCEMENT (89%); ARRESTS (89%); ETHICS (78%); EVIDENCE (78%); TAX FRAUD (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); TAXES & TAXATION (77%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (76%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (74%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (74%); SHAREHOLDERS (68%) Ethiopia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Economy, Business and Finance","After 90 days in police custody over allegations of corruption, Melaku Fenta, the former director general of the Ethiopian Revenues & Customs Authority (ERCA), will face charges in the next 15 days. He will be tried along with most of the 63 high and mid-level tax officials and businessmen detained with him. The arrests came as part of a recent crackdown on high level tax officials and businessmen launched by the Federal Ethics & Anti-Corruption Commission (FEACC), in early May 2013. The timeframe was set on Friday, August 9, 2013, when the Commission's investigators informed the Second Criminal Bench of the Federal High Court that they had released 10 people on bail. This was in addition to the six already released previously. They also announced they have wrapped up their investigations and would be ready to file charges in 15 days. Most prominent among those released on bail was Eshetu Woldesemayat, chief attorney general of the ERCA. This decision represented a change from previous court dates when investigators repeatedly asked for more time to conduct further investigations and gather evidence. Since the case began, judges have granted up to seven time extensions for each file. Initially, the list of detainees was presented to the court in three separate files. This eventually grew to seven, as additional suspects were arrested. It was during a court appointment for six of the seven files that investigators announced the closing of their investigation. The list of detainees includes - tax officials, Gebrewahed W. Giorgis, former director of Low Enforcement Directorate at the ERCA; Mamo Abdi, advisor to Melaku, and Markeneh Alemayehu, former deputy director of prosecution at the ERCA. Prominent businessmen were also jailed, including - Simachew Kebede, who runs InterContinental Addis; Ketema Kebede, major shareholder of K.K. Plc; Nega G. Egziabhere, major shareholder in Netsa Trading Plc; Fikru Maru (MD), who runs Addis Cardiac Hospital and Mihretab Abraha, a businessman and brother of former TPLF leader, Siye Abraha. As lawyers of the detained decried the multiple continuation requests, the Commission's investigator argued that the alleged crimes are interlinked. This is despite the fact that they spanned different regions, like Oromia, Afar and the Southern Regional State. Adding, too, that they were complicated. Indeed, the list of suspicions being read out in Court has grown longer with each court date and now includes tax evasion, auditing irregularities, misuse of duty free imports, illegal import of cement using the prohibited Franco Valuta method and the halting of charges and investigations for undue benefits. But this all came to an end last Friday, as investigators announced the completion of their enquiry. Other than Eshetu, those who were released on bail included - Tigist Alemayehu, the sister of Markeneh Alemayehu; Baheru Abreha, major shareholder of Natan & Bisrat Trading Plc and Tewoldebisrat G. Medhin, director of the ERCA's Crime Investigation Unit. Dagne Seneshaw, a customs official at the ERCA; Muluken Tesfaye, Seyoum Leikun and Hailemariam Assefa, all of whom worked at the WoW Transit Company; Almaz Kebede, co-owner of WoW Transit; Frehiwot Getachew, who operates her own transit company and Degu Awgechew, a driver at the Ethiopian Airforce, were also released on bail. They were released on Thursday and Friday morning before the court appointment, according to sources at the Commission interviewed by Fortune. For the rest of the detainees, investigators asked that bail be denied. The court granted the request after a prosecutor from the Commission successfully argued that the charges to be brought carry sentences of at least 10 years imprisonment. In such cases, bail rights are restricted by law. The Court allowed the Commission up until August 22, 2013 to file charges. The content and count of the charges will be decided until then, according to a source from the Commission. Two out of the 64 will not be prosecuted and the Commission is yet to decide whether charges will be brought against those released on bail, the source also informed Fortune."433,The Daily Monitor,8/15/13,Makerere security chief probed over corruption,,UGANDA (94%); UNITED STATES (79%),Newspaper,ANDREW BAGALA -1,ENGLISH,,,25-Jun-14,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (94%)",338  words,INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); SCHOOL SAFETY & SECURITY (90%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (78%); POLICE FORCES (78%); CAMPUS SECURITY (77%); ARRESTS (73%); MISAPPROPRIATION (72%); INTELLIGENCE SERVICES (72%); CURRENCIES (68%),"It is alleged that he was given Shs21 million but has failed to give accountability to the University and his superiors.

Kamara, has urged that corruption be made a 'high risk and low profit venture' in the country. He was speaking at the end of a two-day training workshop for 50 members of the Sierra Leone Parliamentary Press Gallery (SLPPG) yesterday. The workshop on reporting corrupt practices and activities of the anti-graft body within parliament was sponsored by the ACC. Kamara said the commission had train not only the parliamentary press but also the judiciary reporters in reporting on the fight to combat graft in the country. He expressed disappointment that a section of society seems to side with officials convicted on corrupt charges, apparently being oblivious that monies they embezzled would have been spent on social amenities. He appealed that citizens should side with the commission by reporting corrupt practices, rather than supporting those who loot from them (the people). Giving an overview of the training, the Director of Public Education and Outreach Department at the ACC, Shollay Davies, said the ACC Act of 2008 was enacted to combat corruption, with the media being a critical partner in fighting the menace. He said reporting corruption cases meant reporters needed enhanced skills in carrying out their duties effectively and efficiently. He underscored that the media has a key role to play in the fight against corruption, as they could break and make any individual or institution, as well as propagate development agenda in the county. Mr. Davies stated that if the media was instrumental in reporting corrupt practices, they needed to be capacitated to be able to report accurately, effectively and efficiently. President of the Sierra Leone Association of Journalists (SLAJ), Kelvin Lewis, admonished members of the Gallery to regard the training as beneficial to honing their skills on reporting corruption issues raised in parliament, and to ensure that bills enacted or agreements debated in the House are accurate. He said journalists should be fearless in their reportage on corruption, as it is a public duty. President of the Press Gallery, Elias Bangura, commended the ACC and parliament for the laudable initiative to train journalists, adding that the members needed such training to serve as refresher courses in accurately reporting on corruption cases. On his part, Commissioner Augustine A. Garmoh of the Independent Media Commission said the golden rules of journalism are accuracy, truth, impartiality, and justice, noting: ""If you [are in] doubt, leave out."" He urged that journalists should not publish misleading or distorted information, but should check and cross-check the accuracy of information before putting it out to the public. Pictures, including photo cropping are permissible, yet it should be done with utmost professionalism, he said."436,The Daily Monitor,8/28/13,Anti Corruption Bill 2013 tabled in Parliament,,UGANDA (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,25-Jun-14,,207  words,CORRUPTION (93%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (65%),"If passed into law, the Bill would provide the government with binding powers to confiscate property of people convicted of corruption by the Anti Corruption Court.

Melaku Fenta, former director general of the Ethiopian Revenues & Customs Authority (ERCA), and his then deputy, Gebrewahed W. Giorgis, are among those indicted. Charges are spread across eight different files. Although the charges were expected to be read in the afternoon, this was rescheduled to Friday morning, August 30, 2013. This is because there was a question as to which bench is supposed to hear the case, according to sources at the Federal High Court. It was the remand bench that was informed that charges were filed this morning. Fourteen days additional investigation time was requested, in order to process audit reports for four people. These were - Mehereteab Abraha, the businessman brother of TPLF veteran Seye Abraha; Fitsum Gebremedhin, a businessman; Tekleab Zerabruk, the ERCA's Mille Branch manager, and Begziabhere Alebel, a major shareholder of Ultimate Plan Plc, a construction consulting company. Hence, no charges were brought. The remand bench granted the Commission seven days and adjourned the hearing for the four suspects until August 6, 2013. The prosecutors have decided not to file charges against three people and the court ordered they be set free. Those to be released are - Mesale Woldeselassie and Negussie Kebret, from Tigabu Gidey et al file, and Getachew Assefa, from Temesgen Seyoum et al file. Moreover, prosecutors asked that Mule Gashaw, from Gebrewahed et al file, be transferred to the Oromia Ethics & Anti-Corruption Commission (OEACC) due to jurisdictional issues. Judges granted the prosecutors demand and ordered the transfer of Mulu within the next five days. The arrest of some of the top taxmen in the country and their family members, along with close to 60 prominent and mid-level businessmen, customs officials and freight forwarders, which began in early May 2013, was the start of a long drawn-out investigation into corruption allegations. The Commission has been investigating a mile-long list of alleged suspicions, including -the halting of investigations, goods passing through customs uninspected and having the books of the companies under investigation audited twice for undue benefits on the part of officials. Businessmen, on the other hand, are accused of alleged tax evasion through graft, the import of cement using the prohibited Franco Valuta method and selling duty-free imports meant for investment. Except for the four suspects whose hearing has been adjourned until August 6, the seven investigation appointment files that the second criminal bench has been hearing for the past three months, have been closed. Those facing charges are now included in the eight new files, with some of the suspects appearing in more than one file. Gebrewahed W. Giorgis's name appears in three of the charge files.

Cllr. Frances Johnson-Allison, chair of the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC). Cllr. Johnson-Allison made the disclosure Tuesday during a courtesy call to thank the management of the New Democrat newspaper for sustained reportage that enhanced the national surge against corruption. She explained that the peer review mechanism aims at gauging the level of Liberia's compliance with the convention against corruption and the mechanisms being put in place to fight corruption in the country. She said a technical team including professionals from diverse backgrounds was working on questionnaires submitted to LACC from UNCAC aimed at implementing the pier review mechanism. ""We want it to be as participatory as possible. So we invited the PUL, civil society organizations, representatives of institutions of integrity, as well as people in government cycle,"" she said. After the questionnaires are returned to UNCAC, she said Benin and South Africa, who are also state parties to the anti-corruption convention, would peer review Liberia while Liberia and Timor-Leste will review Angola. She said the exercise is also intended to ""know whether bribery is a crime under the local laws of countries being reviewed or whether or not they have a dedicated body to fight corruption."" The United Nations Convention against Corruption is a legally binding international anti-corruption instrument on signatory state parties, providing a unique opportunity to mount a global response to a global problem, she asserted. Adopted in October 2003 by the UN General Assembly, UNCAC is the first global framework to harmonize anti-corruption efforts worldwide. The 165 countries bound by UNCAC which came into force in December 2005, offers a global chance for change since it is widely recognized as the most promising initiative to curb the corruption worldwide. Meanwhile, she said the fight against corruption here was progressing with assets verification gradually taking root."439,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),9/6/13,ZAOU Don Counsels Against Corruption,,ZAMBIA (90%),Newspaper,Nakubiana Shabongo,ENGLISH,,,7-Sep-13,"LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (90%)",277 words,CORRUPTION (92%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (90%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (90%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (90%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (90%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (67%); BANKING & FINANCE (66%) Zambia; Corruption,"ZAMBIA Open University (ZAOU) Chancellor Francis Yamba has urged graduates to guard against involving themselves in corrupt activities when they join industry. Professor Yamba said corruption should be fought in the quest to have a better country that was free of the vice. He was speaking in Lusaka yesterday when he awarded various degrees to 757 graduating students from a total of 885 qualified students. He called on the graduands to loathe and fight corruption when they were given opportunities to serve the country in whatever capacity whether public or private. Prof Yamba said with patriotism the country could defeat the scourge of corruption and change for the better. ""It is my sincere gratitude that the graduands we are producing today should be of nothing short of integrity so that they do not fall for anything especially the dirty scourge of corruption which retards national development,"" he said. Vice Chancellor Dickson Mwansa appealed to the graduands to be patriotic citizens that would serve with dignity, corrupt free morals and ensure that justice in all its forms flowed like a river that never ran dry. ""We look to you to work with humility wherever you find yourself be it in the media, legal practice, law enforcement, financial services, research institutions, universities and the public service at large,"" he said. Prof Mwansa said the university would focus on infrastructure development in order to empower the people with knowledge whilst enhancing the value of education to its finest level. He said the university had constructed four classrooms and would soon put up hostels in Lusaka that would accommodate more than 2,000 bed spaces."442,The Namibian (Windhoek),9/20/13,Put an End to Legalised Corruption [editorial],,NAMIBIA (96%); UNITED STATES (92%); AFRICA (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,20-Sep-13,,664 words,CURRENCIES (90%); US DOLLAR (90%); CORRUPTION (89%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (89%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (89%); PRIME MINISTERS (89%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (89%); DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS (89%); BUDGETS (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (77%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (77%); MINERAL LEASES (77%); ETHICS (76%); COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS (74%); EXCHANGE RATES (73%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (72%); MINING REGULATION & POLICY (72%); MINING & EXTRACTION RIGHTS & ROYALTIES (72%); BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (69%); MINES & MINING (67%) Namibia; Corruption; Governance,"THIS headline is not a mere play with oxymorons and semantics. It's about the multi-billion dollar [you pick whether Namibian or US dollar] handling of Namibia's national incomes. Mind you, government contracts through the Tender Board alone amounted to N$14 billion last year, which was 37% of the national budget. The worrying issue is that abuse and misuse of state processes and resources for private gain is often 'legal' [well, what else can we say?]. Examples abound. Among recent cases at an institutional level is the military's food contract of between N$3 billion to N$5 billion over 10 years that former Prime Minister and now Minister of Defence Nahas Angula is championing. At an individual level one can point to the case of Prime Minister Hage Geingob, who, while as a Swapo backbencher, was paid US$300 000 (about N$3million at today's exchange rate) in 2006 or 2007, according to him, to advise the Namibian government to award a mining license to UraMin. UraMin is the company that, it has since become clear, overcharged the French parastatal Areva when it sold Namibia's Trekkopje and two other mines on the African continent for US$2.5b in 2005-7. Mining at Trekkopje is yet to take off. The two examples stand out, but there are many in between. Not least among those is the raking in of hundreds of millions of dollars through S&T claims. We stick to the abbreviation because S&T is now more than the 'subsistence and travel allowance' that it was meant to be - it is legalised corruption. Angula, the Minister of Defence, is arguing that he is undertaking a noble objective aimed at keeping the money within the military firms, which will in turn buy straight from suppliers of the foodstuff. The presence of private individuals as shareholders in those military companies and, especially, the secretive nature of how the deal was structured, makes it questionable. If the minister and his military generals have not broken the law, they will kid no one that what they did isn't at least morally and ethically corrupt. Similarly, Geingob's role in the awarding of a licence to UraMin and Areva and further favours extended to the French uranium company by the Ministry of Trade and Industry under his guidance are rotten, even if he later disclosed his dealings to Parliament and the President. Together with the S&Ts and other avenues that lend themselves to misuse, these are the areas that the government ought to tighten up, if only to provide confidence that our leaders will at all times act in the best interest of the country and the majority, and not a privileged few. The bill about government contracts that Minister of Finance Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila tabled in the National Assembly this week will no doubt improve on the deficiencies of the Tender Board Act. But it is lacking in transparency. We would suggest, for instance, that independent audits of any government contract be randomly and regularly undertaken [at intervals of three to six months]. The results must always be made public without the consent of politicians. The audits would, for instance, have helped in ensuring that the N$15 billion special job-creation programme, Tipeeg, or other government tenders, truly deliver on the intended purpose. Audits [not a mere look at the financials of the companies involved] would show whether the money was reaching the intended targets. At the moment many a tenderpreneur [colour notwithstanding] often rush to buy themselves luxury goods while state projects and objectives like job creation suffer. It is preposterous, for instance, that of the N$14 billion tenders government awarded last year, N$9.3 billion were ""exempted"" from public scrutiny and open bidding. Often security is cited as reasons for the exemption. The Ministry of Defence's claim of sensitivity to ""national security"" over its N$5 billion food contract will not wash. It is about time that at all public levels, the screws be tightened to put an end to legalised corruption."444,The Namibian (Windhoek),9/23/13,No Systematic Corruption in Namibia - Geingob,,"NAMIBIA (94%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (94%); AFRICA (79%)",Newspaper,Tuyeimo Haidula,ENGLISH,,,23-Sep-13,,378 words,CORRUPTION (93%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (90%); PRIME MINISTERS (89%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (79%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (78%); WAGES & SALARIES (71%); CRIME RATES (70%) Namibia; Corruption; Governance,"PRIME MINISTER Hage Geingob last week told a visiting Tanzanian delegation that there is no systematic corruption in Namibia although there are perceptions. Geingob also told the delegation that corruption is a curse that needed to be fought. ""There is no systematic corruption in Namibia, although perceptions are here and there,"" Geingob said. The Tanzanian delegation, led by Minister of State, George Mkuchika, paid Geingob a visit at his offices in a bid to share ideas and learn how to combat corruption. Mkuchika revealed that corruption in his country is on the rise hence his visit to Namibia. He said, among other responsibilities, he is expected to help the president with state issues, prevent corruption and other unethical things as well as participating in budget issues. ""I hope during my time, I can help Tanzanians understand that corruption is number one enemy. I am not saying corruption is only in Tanzania, I know this is a global issue. Although we are fighting it, it does not seem to go down in our country but rather increases. The crime rate is increasing and so are corruption cases,"" he said, adding that every year, seven percent of the government budget ends up in procurement. Sharing the same sentiments as those of Mkuchika, Tanzania's director general for the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau Edward Hosea said they are busy spending money on campaigns to fight corruption. Hosea believes there are two possible reasons for every corruption case, citing poverty as one of them. ""Poverty is one of the reasons why corruption is on the increase. People are in need of money as their salaries can hardly take them through the month, much less afford basic needs,"" he said. Hosea also said another reason was pure greed from those in already high positions who want more money for themselves. But he said that he believes Africans need a leadership paradigm to fight corruption. ""If you can't demonstrate that corruption is intolerable, then you are wasting your time trying to fight it. People understand what corruption is, but they need to be made aware that it is intolerable. Engagement of political masses must be seen. They must not appear fighting corruption but they should be seen fighting to encourage other people,"" Hosea said."445,The Herald (Harare),9/27/13,"Shun Corruption, Says Mutasa",,ZIMBABWE (96%); AFRICA (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,27-Sep-13,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (92%)",519 words,POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); PRIMARY SCHOOLS (90%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (78%); EXECUTIVES (77%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION (77%); LIVING STANDARDS (68%); LITERACY & ILLITERACY (65%); LITERACY RATES (60%); SECONDARY SCHOOLS (50%) Zimbabwe; Corruption,"Presidential Affairs Minister Didymus Mutasa has urged public officials to shun corruption and be custodians of good practices to ensure the success of Government programmes. Officially opening the Herentals Tynwald Private Primary School in Harare yesterday, Minister Mutasa said President Mugabe was doing all he could to uplift the lives of Zimbabweans and the efforts should be fully complemented. The school, whose construction started in 2011, comprises two blocks with 10 classrooms, two smaller classroom blocks and an administration block. ""We should have a corruption free Zimbabwe as we work hard to achieve the goals we have set as a Government for the next five years after our resounding victory in the harmonised elections,"" said Minister Mutasa. ""The call begins with us public officials and should cascade down to grassroots levels. Everyone in Government should focus on uplifting the standards of living. The President is on record denouncing corruption for us to realise development and we should come in and support his efforts."" Minister Mutasa said had the officials involved in the building of the school been corrupt, the project would not have been a success. ""We never thought we would have such a day like this,"" he said. ""But, because you were open in your operations and put your hearts towards the project, it is today a success. These are some of the signs where a corrupt free country will take us to."" Minister Mutasa said the new school would go a long way in complementing Government efforts of improving school infrastructure countrywide. ""This is a welcome gesture by Herentals that would assist Government because money that would have been used by the State to build such a school would now go towards other areas,"" he said. ""As such, I urge the corporate world to extend such a hand to Government for it to achieve its targets outlined in the Zanu-PF manifesto. I am excited that such a model we are seeing here today is the one that is going to be used in the construction of Maturi Primary School in Headlines, which is my constituency. ""I would be happy if this spreads to other parts of the country such that we maintain our control of the literacy rate level in Africa."" The minister said Government would offer land to people willing to construct schools and institutions that benefit children. Herentals Group of Colleges and Schools executive director Mr Emmanuel Mahachi said education was pivotal to national development and the group would continue complementing Government efforts in the sector. He said the literacy level Zimbabwe boasts of was due to the people's love for books. ""Resources permitting, we will continue establishing primary, secondary schools and colleges countrywide to ensure we reach out to all corners,"" Mr Mahachi said. ""The more education we give to our children the more developed, as a country we become. Our advantage is that in President Mugabe we have a man who values education and would want to see more resources being channeled to the education sector.""

The fundamental reason is my aversion of working for a toothless organisation with no significant leverage to push for its decisions in changing the lives of people. But, there is also a further reason - corruption. My five years at the Ministry of Finance & Economic Development (MoFED) have given me enough exposure to the workings of the various UN organisations. The crosscutting similarity between all of them, at least as far as I saw it, was the systematisation of corruption. Corruption in the UN system has many technical wraps, from retreat to consultancy. Any organisation that seeks to have a UN status seems also to copy the corrupt practices of the global beast. That seems to be why the African Union (AU), the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), the Intergovernmental Agency for Development (IGAD) and many other regional organisations that copy the status and structure of the UN remain as systemically corrupt as their mentor. At the heart of the corruption, in both the UN and its protges, is the human resource recruitment process. It is so spoiled that it is visibly disgusting. Competence has nothing to do with it. What matters is a good blood, as Ethiopians say, to express ""good connection."" During my days at the MoFED, I appraised many projects that the Ethiopian government works on in close collaboration with the various UN agencies. I have met many project coordinators from the UN agencies' side that improperly push for the continuation of projects simply to secure their high-paid jobs. In my informal discussion with them, most tell me how important the job is for them and for their families. I used to get confused about the paradox. An Ethiopian civil servant who often gets paid a meagre income fights about the impact of projects on the livelihood of citizens, while a UN employee, who grosses over 200pc more, worries about job security. It is only after some time that I came to understand the root cause for the worries of the project coordinators - systematised corruption. After all, they got the job not because they are competent enough, but because they have good connections. Recently, a friend of mine from one of the western African nations came toEthiopiato consult the African Union (AU) on issues relating to intra-African trade. He told me that he was being paid 20,000 plus dollars for a month, in addition to five-star accommodation, fancy transportation and cost for utilities. It is not his rather fancy recruitment that amazed me, however. Rather, it was his simple observation. He once asked me - ""Why do Ethiopians work only as guards and gardeners in the major international and regional organisations based in Addis Abeba?"" Isn't it logical that one would expect to see more Ethiopian professionals in these organisations, for the simple reason of physical proximity?"" My answer was simple - ""Yes. The question might be logical. But, the answer is not"". The recruitment process of these organisations is spoiled with nepotism, corruption, racial short-termism and personal affiliations, which even highly educated and experienced Ethiopians could not access. This is unless, of course, they have the good blood. It all boils down to the type of blood one has. Even reformers, such as the newly appointed Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), Carlos Lopes, are seen swayed by the decades-old culture of corruption in the system. Their approach continues to be based on employing their former colleagues as highly paid consultants, under the guise of institutional reform. What can signal the demise of an institution more than the systematisation of corrupt practices, though? I wonder how ordinary Africans, let alone Ethiopians, would accept the big words of integration, unity, development, poverty reduction, empowerment and so on, while the very preachers are unprincipled enough to live with sanity. How can institutional legitimacy be established under the waters of corruption? As a pacemaker of a system, recruitment ought to be free of nepotism. It ought to be established purely on the basis of competence. Salaries ought to be indications of professionalism and they ought to be earned. These ought to be more defining when organisations have no hard power to realise them. But, if the world is to follow the UN way, its end is certainly a train wreck. Incubating corruption at all levels will do nothing other than reducing an institution to a toothless, disrespected, inefficient and illegitimate beast. And, working for such an institution bears no pride. Of course, the trend applies to most of the bilateral development agencies too. But it is not as momentous as in the UN and its protges. If change is to come, then the movers and shakers of these various organisations with funny abbreviations ought to start baptising their system in the name of sanity, integrity, professionalism and impartiality. It all, however, ought to start from the top. Creating a culture that abhors favouritism could not be secured by reforming human resource departments only. It rather sits in bringing a new culture that stands in favour of competence. I see no more pertinent task than this for the toothless globalisers based in Addis Abeba and New York. Getachew T.

She described the President's recent suspension and dismissal of some senior government officials as an important step in the fight against corruption. She, however, indicated that more has to be done in order to make significant progress in the fight against graft and misuse of public resources.

""We can talk about the need to punish or prosecute perpetrators, but it's very important to stress that these forms of violence must be rejected by society,"" SRSG Landgreen said. She added: ""Once it's socially unacceptable to engage in sexual violence. Once, it's unacceptable to go after suspected perpetrators of crimes and kill them.""

She singled out the agriculture sector where she said farmers needed to fully enjoy benefits from their efforts. Speaking at a graduation ceremony for participants of the Tobacco Improved Productivity Sites at Kutsaga Research Station in Harare yesterday, VP Mujuru said despite the phenomenal growth registered by the tobacco industry in recent years, farmers were not enjoying the rewards for their labour. ""Tobacco farmers work hard, plant crops and get to contribute to the national income, hence we expect them to be given a hand so that they can use other smaller portions on their farms to meet their daily food requirements,"" she said. ""It is only through an evidently changed standard of living that agriculture can be appreciated by the different facets of the community."" VP Mujuru said empowering people through giving them the rightful returns for their labour was one way of fighting corruption. ""People are overcharging in health institutions, some are being corrupt at roadblocks,"" she said. ""White collar crime has also taken centre stage in this country, and this should be condemned."" VP Mujuru implored financial institutions to loan out money at reasonable rates. ""Banks are enjoying the peace and security in our country and should, therefore, give farmers money at cheaper rates for our industry to grow. ""We should show that we now own the resources,"" she said. ""Let us conserve our land as the most precious thing. ""No one will be relocated to better places having failed to properly use what they already have."" VP Mujuru hailed tobacco farmers for being successful despite being adversely affected by the illegal economic sanctions imposed on the country by the West. She said it was gratifying to note that tobacco growing was on the rise again. ""The rebound of the tobacco industry has resulted in much excitement with indications that tobacco contributed 10,7 percent of the GDP in 2012,"" said VP Mujuru. ""There is still room for much growth and all stakeholders need to play their part to ensure that Zimbabwe not only produces the quantity, but also produces the quality desired by our markets."" VP Mujuru commended the tobacco industry for ""the sterling work that has allowed this extraordinary expansion"" and urged the stakeholders to continue working together for the benefit of the country. Alluding to reports that farmers in some areas were now growing cash crops instead of grains to make more money, VP Mujuru said Government was determined for small grains to be sold at best prices . She said if farmers concentrated on crops that were ideal for their farming regions, the country would not import food. ""The money we have been using to import grain from countries like Zambia should be used to pay local farmers,"" said VP Mujuru. ""It should work towards ensuring job creation and making indigenisation a reality in all sectors."" The training programme for the tobacco farmers was conducted by Kutsaga as part of efforts to improve productivity of tobacco growers through practical lessons on all aspects of growing the crop. Mr Suarance Matope of Omeath Farm in Mashonaland Central scooped the first prize in the farmers' category among the farmers in the 15 tobacco growing regions who took part in the training. Mr Matope's trainer and Agritex officer Mr Peter Tsungu won the first prize in the officers' category."449,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),10/6/13,Public Procurement Authority Versus Corruption,,ZAMBIA (97%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,6-Oct-13,,1426 words,CORRUPTION (98%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (88%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); LEGISLATION (76%); PUBLIC CONTRACTS LAW (75%); POLICE FORCES (69%); CRIME PREVENTION (66%); PURCHASING & PROCUREMENT (60%) Zambia; Corruption,"THERE are widespread feelings that the fight against corruption in Zambia does not seem to be fully taken up by everyone in the country. By nature of things, it is almost impossible to exclude anyone except where positive opinions or evidence does not show. As it is not feasible or practical for everybody to issue a statement saying they are opposed to corruption or does corrupt acts which can tend to be judged as corrupt acts, we have to look at the whole issue as laid down under the laws of Zambia. Let us begin with an old saying ""For evil to triumph all that is needed is that all good people do nothing."" President Michael Sata, again, said in his address to the National Assembly on Friday September 20, 2013: ""The fight against corruption remains one of the top priorities on our good governance agenda. Government will, therefore, strengthen and decentralise the operations of the Anti-Corruption Commission to enable it to effectively execute its mandate."" He then announced that the Government had established a special investigations unit (like the old SITET) in the commission to deal with complex financial crimes. The basic issues affecting the fight against corruption are: Failure by those under whom activities take place but are unable, afraid, unwilling to prevent these crimes and lack of dedication to their duties. Other reasons given for failure to fight corruption are the alleged widespread corruption within the Zambia Police Service, Judiciary and politicians. There have also been allegations that some people have been 'visited' or threatened by the culprits, therefore, the tendency is to make general allegations naming no-one in particular. This is in spite of the various pieces of legislation which give some protection and authority to step forward and put a stop to the practice. The Judiciary does not help the fighters by the slow pace at which reports are handled. As the Government and local councils are the biggest spenders, there is belief that it is in the public service that the battle has got to be reinforced with change of attitude, fearlessness against undue influences and actually imposing the penalties. Following certain weaknesses discovered in the Zambia National Tender Board, which was replaced by the Zambia Public Procurement Authority, the new Act No 12 of 2008 restated the principal objectives thus: To revise the law relating to procurement so as to ensure transparency and accountability in public procurement; regulate and control practices relating to public procurement in order to promote the integrity of, fairness and public confidence in, the procurement process. Let us look at the Public Procurement Act, No 12 of 2008 which was supposed to process enquiries and downstream action more quickly. After President Sata announced enhanced action against corruption, British High Commissioner, James Thornton stated that there is too much corruption in Zambia. He is concerned at the lack of commitment by those who should do more. The British Government has been committing the British taxpayer's money to assist the Zambian Government in the fight against corruption for a long time. At the same time, a senior officer in the Zambia Public Procurement Authority (ZPPA) was issuing a statement that politicians' interference in the public procurement process which was making it difficult to fight corruption. The details he had seem not to have been passed on to the ACC to pursue further. It is this desire to issue statements rather than report to the ACC which prevent the general public from thinking that there is anything to expect in the ZPPA. For the removal of doubts about this image of the Authority the law says in regard to enforcement of integrity fairness and trust in the body... A few definitions will do: ""coercive practices"" means harming or threatening to harm directly or indirectly, a person or person's property, to influence participation in a procurement process or affect the execution of a contract."" The statement explaining how senior officers and politicians influence the procurement process called immediately... why he had not given the details to the ACC or to the Zambia Police. ""corrupt practice"" means the offering, giving or receiving or soliciting, directly or indirectly, anything of value to influence the action of a public officer in the procurement process or in contract execution."" ""goods"" means objects of any kind and description including raw materials, products, equipment, objects in solid, liquid or gaseous form, electricity and works and services incidental to the supply of the goods if the value of those incidental works and services does not exceed that of the goods themselves."" The ZPPA officer who bemoaned the behaviour of politicians and public officers showed exactly why the fight against corruption cannot be defeated as long as such people continue to hold office. Without going into too many details, the senior ZPPA official referred to above, could not have been ignorant of: section 75 (2) (b) ""A public officer commits an offence who uses the position as a public officer dishonestly or with the intention of directly or indirectly gaining an advantage for oneself or someone else or causing detriment to a procurement entity;"" section 75 (2) (c) ""Uses the position of a public officer recklessly without regard to whether the conduct may directly or indirectly gain an advantage for oneself or someone else or cause detriment to a procurement entity;"" and is liable to the applicable administrative and legal sanctions applicable to public officers under the conditions of employment and any other written of law. With these provisions within the law which set up the ZPPA why does anybody especially a senior official in that organisation complain about political interference? To revisit some of the applicable considerations: (a) The Public Interest Disclosure (Protection of Whistleblowers) Act, No 4 of 2010 Section 10: 'An employer shall not subject an employee to any occupational detriment on account or partly on account, of an employee having made a protected disclosure or public interest disclosure"". This reference should be well known by all employees, including the senior managers of ZPPA. Under the same Act (12 of 2008) the ZPPA should by now have written rules and regulations in the field of public procurement. For the official to say there is need for rules governing the code of conduct is laughable, because this is the basis on which the organisation can base its day-to-day activities. Another note of interest is the statement (or allegation) by the chairperson of the Zambia Chapter of African Parliamentary Network Against Corruption (APNAC) Hon Cornelius Mweetwa. Again we see the same inability to take action but resort to issuing statements. It is reported in the Post newspapers that there was considerable abuse of UNWTO funds before and during the UNWTO conference held in Livingstone and Zimbabwe, around Victoria Falls. Hon Mweetwa said that according to the information he had received, the companies that were given contracts were the same ones that were contracted as consultants. Surely APNAC should not have sat on their hands until after the meetings. It is totally irregular ... the management of resources could have seen the reported developments. This country has undertaken projects of this kind, but APNAC should have been in the forefront of ensuring that the resources would be properly managed. This is yet another of how NOT to fight corruption or abuse of funds and other resources. The Auditor-General reported these names to the Ministry of Tourism and the ACC, but nothing has been heard from APNAC - Hon. Mweetwa, what is going on? the Zambians want to see positive action on corruption. Reporting to the press or the National Assembly will not do. Like evaluating intelligence, the bodies concerned with preventing collusion, abuse of resources... official positions should organise themselves. We want to receive reports of action taken not to bewail the happenings. The Government should not be expected to restructure institutions when the aims are clear and accepted. It is essential that the ZPPA show capacity to defeat corruption. Nobody else will do it except the Zambians themselves. If appointed or nominated officials cannot show better dedication, they should be removed. There is need to shape up or ship out. The country's name and image can be damaged by the attitudes shown so far by people in high places, who do not seem to understand why they are in these positions."451,The Namibian (Windhoek),10/8/13,Anti-Corruption Fight Goes to New Level,,ZIMBABWE (95%); UNITED STATES (79%); GHANA (79%); AFRICA (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,8-Oct-13,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (79%)",603 words,CORRUPTION (92%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (91%); POLITICS (89%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (89%); ETHICS (78%); ELECTIONS (77%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (70%); INVESTIGATIONS (69%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (68%); TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (60%) Zimbabwe; Corruption,"After years of dilly-dallying, Zimbabwe's parliamentarians will finally be compelled to declare their assets as part of measures to curb corruption. Previously, the declaration of assets by Members of Parliament was done on a voluntary basis. And only a fraction of the parliamentarians took the bold step. But the game has changed. Members of the 370-seat Parliament are now mandatory to declare assets. Most of the Cabinet ministers are also parliamentarians. Speaker Jacob Mudenda said he expected measures to be put in place to compel parliamentarians to declare their assets during the first session of the Parliament. Zimbabwe's new parliament, with the ruling Zanu-PF party taking more than two-thirds majority seats, was mostly elected in the July 31 elections. The new parliament officially opened on 17 September, and the order to declare assets soon came in toe. ""Only through that self-transparency will we deserve and live to that epithet. This will send a clear message that this Parliament will not condone any form of corruption,"" Mudenda said. While opening the session, President Robert Mugabe said the government would exercise ""zero tolerance"" to the scourge of corruption. Structures to combat it would be bolstered through the establishment of the National Prosecution Authority as prescribed in the new Constitution, the president said. This independent body is set to take over the functions previously performed by the Criminal Division of the Attorney General's Office. The composition of the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission will also be aligned to the new Constitution, while Anti-Corruption Commissioners will be required to adhere to a strict code of ethics and to also publicly declare their personal assets. In another show of zero tolerance to corruption, Mugabe also openly accused a former chairperson of a parastatal body involved in the mining development of graft. Such open accusation, especially from the president, is not common. The government has now instituted investigations against Goodwills Masimirembwa, who has professed innocence even though Mugabe mentioned him by name and accused him of soliciting 6 million US dollars from a Ghanaian businessman to facilitate his investment. The Anti-Corruption Trust of Southern Africa immediately welcomed Mugabe's utterances on corruption and said this virtual declaration of war was in line with the United Nations Convention Against Corruption. The convention refers to the critical role of prosecutorial services in combating corruption, the existence of a capacitated anti-corruption body and the importance of codes of ethics and the declaration of assets. Mugabe has in the past been accused of not taking a strong stance against corruption. Several people interviewed by Xinhua also welcomed the new requirement of parliamentarians and said politicians were more susceptible to corruption than ordinary citizens. ""They know all the shortcuts and can facilitate illegal transactions using their political clout. We have seen some top people fleeing the country for allegedly being involved in shady deals such as money laundering and externalisation of funds,"" said Charles Mariga of Highfield, Harare. Faith Motsi, also of Harare, said it was disheartening to always see the well-connected enjoying public services while those who were not were left to fork out a lot of money in order to be served. ""Why should I pay to jump the queue at the passport office? Why should I pay to get a place for my child at school, even at kindergarten level?

The non-profit is developing a series of tours of its grassroots work in Liberia and Nepal to give travellers a different experience of local culture, while helping to fight bribery, graft and promote transparent government. ""Instead of tourists visiting slum dwellers, I want to show positive things that people are doing to change the quality of their lives in their communities,"" Blair Glencorse, executive director of Accountability Lab, said at an OpenGovHub luncheon in Washington. Tour highlights include a visit to Rappers Against Corruption, a group of singers who are lobbying the Liberian government to provide strong copyright laws for their work. In Nepal, visitors meet Rajneesh Bhandari who is building a network of investigative journalists to fight corruption, using the newly passed Right to Information Act. On the streets of Monrovia, tourists will get to read the Daily Talk, a citizens' newspaper displayed on a big chalkboard at a busy city intersection. It delivers bold headlines, news updates and useful civic information for those who cannot afford a daily newspaper. The most-requested story recently was one giving instructions on how to use the newly installed traffic lights, a novelty for the city. And Accountability Lab has a film school that puts cameras into the hands of Liberians. Their documentaries tell of child labour, electricity shortages, sexual exploitation in schools, water problems and maternal health. The winner at its first film festival in September was a young woman who exposed how teachers coerced sex from students in return for promises of good grades. Glencorse said his goal through all these projects is to have people take responsibility for creating change. ""There is a lot of talk and shouting about corruption among public officials, but there is a sense of otherness about the way it is discussed. People say if someone else pays a bribe then its bribery, but if I pay a bribe, it is just me getting by,"" he said. ""What I do is look at not only systemic and organizational issues around corruption but also personal accountability and responsibility. These are projects where people are doing something about it."""453,The Daily Monitor,10/13/13,Burglars steal sensitive data from anti-corruption NGO,,UGANDA (94%),Newspaper,IVAN OKUDA -1,ENGLISH,,,25-Jun-14,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (90%)",551  words,CORRUPTION (93%); BURGLARY (90%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (89%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (77%); PRESS CONFERENCES (70%); EXECUTIVES (68%); AIDS & HIV (67%); AIDS & HIV TREATMENT (66%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (64%),"Despite the development, ACCU's authorities maintain that they will stand their ground in the fight against graft in the country. Kampala- Burglars have broken into the Anti-Corruption Coalition Uganda (ACCU) offices and robbed the NGO of vital data on corruption cases. The Thursday night burglary left the NGO's offices on Kira Road virtually turned upside down, with more than 20 computers, sensitive data documents and server stolen. By Friday evening, police were still recording statements and seeking clues about the incident. ""We arrived quite early for work as usual only to find our offices had been broken into. The door locks were all destroyed, drawers, files and documents turned upside down. The guard was not sober; it seems he had been chloroformed,"" Mr Felix Kafuma, the NGO's Information Officer, said. He added: ""Obviously it is more than robbery; everything looks planned, we cannot even rule out an inside job. This comes at a time when ACCU is venturing into the dreaded area of unearthing theft of public funds. We have blown the whistle on scandals in influential offices."" This week, the organisation addressed a press conference on what it termed as ""blatant inaction by the Judiciary on corruption at the Law Development Centre court."" FeudsIt has also had a long-standing battle with a local company over alleged inflation of costs of HIV/Aids drugs in which the Auditor General implicates the company of causing the government a loss of more than Shs48 billion. ""Every office has its own locks but these were all broken, the server where we back up the information and hard disk were taken but shockingly, the projector was left intact. You cannot take anything for granted, we strongly feel it was targeted and specific."" ""Why would any thief leave a projector which was easier to carry and even more expensive than the computers and server? We are not making conclusions yet, let the police investigate but who would be interested in our nature of work?"" Ms Cissy Kagaba, the ACCU executive director, told the Sunday Monitor by phone from Mbale. Ms Kagaba was defiant and said the burglary will not deter the NGO from its anti-corruption crusade. ""If it was aimed at disorganising us, then they have failed. It actually gives us the zeal to confront the big monster of corruption in Uganda! It is an act of cowardice, we are not intimidated by an inch and we have all information backed up. They have thrown a stone into a hive of bees,"" Ms Kagaba said.

""But the information we have is that the guard was chloroformed and is not yet in position to talk but we hope to draw clues from him when he recovers which will inform the investigation,"" he said. Police says Mr Ssenkumbi dismissed suspicions of state-engineered break-in to destroy sensitive information under disguised burglary.""I don't think so. Why would government do such a thing?

It is noted world over that corruption is a vice that needs to be eliminated at whatever cost and this is evidenced by most states that criminalise the act. In Uganda, corruption in all its forms is illegal, to this effect, various institutions have been put in place like the IGG, Anti-corruption Police Unit, the Anti corruption Court among others. The NRM government in its Ten Point Programme and its subsequent manifestos made a commitment to fight corruption at whatever cost, a good thing for all to pride in their government. However, I am disheartened that in Uganda, it is almost a crime for one to fight bad things for example corruption. Lately, you are dubbed anti-state, a rebel and in opposition if you dared speak out against the vice. Why fight the anti corruption activists? Sensitizing masses about corruption is the sole responsibility of the state and if the civil society is sensitising masses about corruption and encouraging masses to shun corruption, then the government should instead be happy and join hands, however, this is the obverse; the activists are either arrested or threatened for doing their duty as the citizens of this country.

Speaking at the two-day continental experts consultation conference on drug trafficking and related challenges to human security in Harare, AU director of Social Affairs, Dr Olawale Maiyegun said there was an urgent need for comprehensive and organised interventions to combat drug trafficking. The two-day conference seeks to discuss improved responses to address drug trafficking and related challenges to human security. Also at the centre of discussion is the legislative and law enforcement responses and reporting frameworks, priority strategies and data collection and reporting. ""In Africa we are faced or we are dealing with vast cross borders and coastlines. The presence of fragile and post-conflict States weakens criminal justice systems. ""Corruption, poverty, high youth unemployment are all working together and serving as potential breeding grounds for criminality and a host of social problems. ""We must have a balanced and integrated approach and if these challenges are not confronted we will not overcome,"" said Dr Maiyegun. He said drug trafficking was an organised crime linked to human trafficking, terrorism, trafficking of weapons, small arms which involved corruption and money laundering that serve as a common denominator to all of them. Dr Maiyegun said the devastating consequences of drug trafficking were a threat to democratic governments and stability of nations. ""We are all affected. We are all living witnesses to what happened in Kenya and we can see it shows we are all vulnerable,"" he said adding that drug traffickers continued to seek for new markets and constantly changed their methods of operation. He bemoaned the lack of comprehensive reporting, data collecting and analysis as major challenges. Dr Maiyegun said despite the challenges, Africa had demonstrated a political commitment to address drug trafficking through a comprehensive adoption of the AU Drug Plan of Action. Dr Maiyegun said the AU Peace and Security Council earlier this year took a decision and gave the AU Commission a mandate to address the social and economic security challenges of drug trafficking in Africa. European Union special advisor Mr Giorgio Romano said the bloc was committed to working with Africa to fight drug trafficking. Officer in Charge, Regional office for the Southern Africa office of Drugs and Crime, Mr Ehab Salah Ahmed also said drug use in Africa was expanding particularly among young people and there was a need for countries to find new ways of combating drug trafficking."456,The New Times (Kigali),10/19/13,Former Nyamasheke Executive Secretary Rearrested Over New Corruption Charges,,RWANDA (92%),Newspaper,Jean Pierre Bucyensenge,ENGLISH,,,20-Oct-13,"KIGALI, RWANDA (79%)",434 words,CORRUPTION (91%); EVIDENCE (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); ARRESTS (90%); RESIGNATIONS (90%); BRIBERY (89%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (78%); INTERVIEWS (78%); CONSTRUCTION (74%); ACQUITTAL (61%) Rwanda; Corruption,"The former executive secretary of Nyamasheke District in the Western Province, Jean Pierre Ndagijimana, has been arrested days after he resigned from his position citing personal reasons. Ndagijimana had, on October 10, tendered in his resignation letter to the district mayor and officially handed over office on Tuesday. In an interview with this paper this week, Ndagijimana said he resigned his post to pursue post graduate studies. The Western Region Police Spokesperson Superintendent Hamza Vita confirmed the arrest, saying Ndagijimana was detained on Thursday after new evidence emerged linking him to a new corruption scam in the area. Ndagihimana is alleged to have received Rwf17million 'as a donation' from a construction firm which was hired to build the Hanika-Kivugiza road, according to Police. ""Preliminary investigations indicate that the money was given to him [Ndagijimana] to gain [unlawful] favours,"" Supt Vita told this paper, without giving details. ""That constitutes an act of corruption itself."" The construction of the non-tarmac road is set to cost around one billion Rwandan francs. As the head of administration in the district, he headed the management and technical units and was the overall supervisor for the district staff. ""We are still investigating the case to uncover more evidence. We are soon handing his dossier to the prosecution,"" Vita said. According to Supt Vita, police launched investigations in the new corruption allegations some days ago after a tip off from a well-informed area resident. It is the second time that the former Nyamasheke District employee is detained on corruption related charges in less than three months. In August, Ndagijimana was arrested and detained in Kigali on charges that he tried to bribe an official at the Office of the Ombudsman to cover up false declaration of his wealth. At the time, a spokesman of the Office told this paper that seemingly the idea to bribe their staff came as a result of their investigations which uncovered undeclared assets belonging to the Executive Secretary. However, a subsequent trial heard by a judge at the Nyarugenge Intermediate Court acquitted Ndagijimana of the charges. Supt Vita told Saturday Times that the new corruption charges are unrelated to the first case. Ndagijimana had served as the district executive secretary since 2007. Before he was the executive secretary of Ruharambuga sector in the same district Police called upon residents to continue their cooperation to ensure that corruption is driven out of the community.

At the same time, the architect, Begziabhere Alebel, will remain in police custody following the conclusion of investigations by the Commission. The conclusion of the second round of investigations on the corruption suspects indicated that the jurisdiction of Begziabhere's case lies with the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), Debebe Degafe, the Commission's investigator, informed the court on Wednesday last week. The investigation file of Meheretab has been transferred to the prosecution department, which will now decide whether or not to file charges. The investigator then requested that Meheretab be taken to a correctional facility until the Commission decides whether to file charges. He also insisted that Begziabher should remain in police custody until the case is transferred to the MoJ. Though hearing oral arguments from both sides, the presiding judge decided to abstain from giving a ruling, stating that the case should be seen by a regular three-member bench. This is the second time in a row that a ruling was postponed for both suspects due to an incomplete bench. Though the Federal High Court resumed its regular court sessions last week, after the annual month-long break in August, judges were still not assigned to the Second Criminal Bench, which hears corruption cases. It was after lawyers of the suspects complained to the Court's president that the case was heard by a single judge at the Tenth Criminal Bench. The postponement adds yet another week to the more than five months the suspects have already been held in custody during investigations. They were part of a group of more than 60 suspects, including top names in political and business circles, that the Commission arrested starting in early May 2013, as part of a corruption crackdown in the tax sector. Melaku Fenta, at the time the director general of the ERCA; Gebrewahed Woldegiorgis, his then-deputy of enforcement, and a slew of other top advisors and prosecutors at the ERCA were placed under arrest. Additionally, high-profile businessmen - Ketema Kebede, who is involved in the export, construction and textile industries through K.K Plc; Simachew Kebede, who runs intercontinental Addis; Nega G. Egziabhere, part-owner of Nega City Mall and shareholder in several import and export companies, and Fikru Maru (MD) who runsAddisCardiacHospital- were also arrested. Alleged corruption, including networking with government officials to avoid paying taxes and allowing goods to go through customs uninspected were reasons for the arrest, the Commission announced. After the arrests, the Commission went on to conduct a four-month long investigation, while most suspects remained in custody. They repeatedly asked the court for continuances. In August, investigators announced that they had finished discovery and passed on files to the prosecution to file charges. The prosecution department filed charges on close to 44 of the suspects within the following week. Suspects were not, however, given a chance to hear and respond to the charges, with the closing of the regular bench being cited as a reason. It also released close to 10 suspects on bail. For four of the suspects, including Meheretab and Begziabhere, however, the prosecution stated that investigation files were incomplete and ordered an audit report of their respective companies. The Commission's investigators were back in court again, asking for continuances and for suspects to remain in custody. Six continuances, with no bail granted to suspects, were approved for investigators during this second round, before they finally announced last week that investigations were complete. Meheretab and Begziabhere, as well as their lawyers, argued that there is no need for them to remain in custody from now on. ""I have been in prison for five months at great cost to my business,"" a frustrated Begziabhere said to the presiding judge. ""Is there such a thing as an investigation that takes half a year?"" His lawyer also argued that it is no longer the Commission's mandate to ask for time extensions, if jurisdiction falls under the MoJ. The Commission's investigator, however, insisted that times is needed to hand over files, so it is still in charge until the case completely reassigned to the MoJ. Meheretab should also remain in custody until the prosecution decides to file charges. This is since discovery showed that the government lost nearly four million Birr in revenue due to his alleged corruption, argued Debebe, the investigator. Though taking time out to pass a ruling, the judge finally decided it best for a three-judge panel to oversee the case. Hearings to read and file charges on the 44 suspects already indicted, including Melaku Fenta, were also expected to take place last week. They were, however, postponed until Monday, October 21, when the bench is expected to be complete."458,Addis Fortune,10/20/13,Corruption Concern!,,ETHIOPIA (93%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,21-Oct-13,,334 words,CORRUPTION (93%); TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (90%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (89%); ETHICS (78%); HOTELS & MOTELS (78%); PUBLIC FINANCE (78%); PRIME MINISTERS (78%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (78%); EXCISE & CUSTOMS (75%); EXECUTIVES (70%); TAX ENFORCEMENT (70%); ARRESTS (70%) Ethiopia; Corruption,"Just how much the government wants to emphasise that fighting corruption is one of its top priorities can be witnessed by the big names present at Sheraton Hotel, on October 17, 2013, for a two-day conference to mark the second Bi-Annual Anti Corruption Coalition General Assembly. The event started with Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn (middle right), who came in the morning to open the conference. In his speech, he referenced the current corruption crackdown on the tax and land sectors that led to the arrest of top government officials, including Melaku Fenta, former director general of the Ethiopian Revenues & Customs Authority (ERCA). He stated that ""in the last quarter of 2012/13, we have taken a strong legal measure against companies that are suspected of being a corruption hotbed, including senior government officials"". He added that these officials and big businessmen had such strong ties that they 'were deemed untouchable' by some, but that corruption is something the government will fiercely fight against. That set the mood for the meeting, which focused mainly on mobilising the public to watch out against corruption. Heavyweights within the Oromia People Democratic Organisation (OPDO), Muktar Kedir (far left), minister of Civil Service with a prime minister's portfolio, and Abadula Gemeda , speaker of the House of People's Representatives, led the discussions during the second day. Comments, forwarded by many, including Sebhat Nega, founder of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and executive director of the Ethiopian International Institute for Peace and Development, were answered by Ali Suleiman , commissioner of the Federal Ethics & Anti Corruption Committee, and Muktar. The consensus in the end was that more should be done on the public mobilisation front to fight against corruption.

This is the first of eight indictment files against the high-profile government officials and businessmen that the Commission started detaining in May 2013. The 84-page file, which was heard at the Federal High Court 15th criminal bench, named 31 defendants and included 26 corruption charges. Melaku, Gebrewahed, and Amogne Tagele, director of ERCA's Adama Branch Office, were included in the file. So were some of the big names in business, including Nega G. Egziabhere of Netsa Trading Plc, Ketema Kebede, of K.K. Plc, Getu Gelete, of Get-As International, and Gebreselassie H. Mariam, of Comet Trading Plc. Barring Amogne, only one of the 26 charges was levied directly against these big names. Senior ERCA officials were accused of relaxing the inspection procedures for undue benefits, by using the mutually beneficial relationship they established with these businessmen. The charge specifically mentioned the personal connections of Nega and Gebrewahed, as well as Ketema with Melaku. Other big name companies whose goods get inspection clearance with only invoices as proof rather than actual inspections, include PETRAM Plc, Nyala Motors S.C., Al-Sam Plc, Metals & Engineering Corporation (MetEC), Salini Construction, and Total Ethiopia, according to the indictment file. Most of these companies were declared by ERCA as Authorised Economic Operators (AEO), which can get preferential treatment in the customs process, including shorter clearance time, as an incentive to tax-compliant customers. The charge however states that these were companies selected by Melaku himself and that the system has created a convenient atmosphere for further corruption and fraud. The charge also accuses Melaku and Gebrewahed of contravening a law that instituted impromptu inspections at ERCA's Adama Branch, after a study revealed that the customs clearance system in Adama was looser than Kaliti and thus preferred by alleged tax evaders. The study was conducted to investigate why the Kaliti customs was gaining such low revenues. This has also led for corrupt practices to take root, the charge reads. The remaining 22 charges were made against mostly customs officials from ERCA's Adama Branch and Modjo Dry Port and Terminal, freight-forwarders and their family members. Federal judges Berihu Tewoldeberhan and Mulugeta Kidane alternated in reading the charges - a process that took the whole day after the court session started at half past 10 in the morning. Due to time constraints, pleas by oral arguments were rescheduled for tomorrow. So was the hearing for two other indictment files, which include 18 and 17 people respectively. Melaku and Gebrewahed are included in both these files; they are named in three of the eight indictment files that the Commission has registered in court. In the file that includes 17 people, other high-profile businessmen including Fikru Maru (MD), who runs Addis Cardiac Hospital, and Simachew Kebede of Addis InterContinental Hotel, as well as Ketema and Nega, are named."461,Addis Fortune,10/22/13,Court Grants Bail to Three Defendants in Corruption Probe,,ETHIOPIA (94%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,22-Oct-13,,448 words,CORRUPTION (92%); LAWYERS (90%); INDICTMENTS (90%); SENTENCING (90%); BAIL (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); EVIDENCE (89%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (89%); TRANSPORTATION SUPPORT SERVICES (89%); CRIMINAL LAW (78%); CORRECTIONS (78%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (78%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (78%); ETHICS (77%); PUBLIC FINANCE (77%); EXCISE & CUSTOMS (76%); FREIGHT BROKERS & FORWARDERS (76%); STEPPARENTS (52%) Ethiopia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Three people in the first indictment file read at the Federal High Court on Monday, October 21, which includes 31 people and 26 counts, were granted bail today in the high-profile corruption case launched by the Federal Ethics & Anti-Corruption Commission (FEACC). Semere Negussie, the Ethiopian Revenues & Customs Authority's (ERCA) Adama Branch container inspection official at Modjo Dry Port & Terminal, Mareshet Tesfaye from M.D. Freight-Forwarding, and Dawit Mekonnen, a self-employed broker, can now post 15,000 Br and be released from custody. The defendants' lawyers argued that the crime they were charged with will not get them a sentencing of more than 10 years, which qualifies them for bail. The Commission's prosecutors did not put up any objections and the court accepted the request. The same arguments were also forwarded by lawyers of Zeleke Leyew, manager of Temcha Freight-Forwarders Plc, Degu Abicho, a driver at the Ethiopian Air Force, Shito Negash, stepmother of Amogne Tagele, ERCA's Adama Branch head, and Gebreselassie H. Mariam, shareholder in Comet Trading Plc. However, these arguments did not hold water for the court, which accepted the Commission's argument that these defendants were indeed charged for crimes that could possibly get them a sentencing of more than 10 years if convicted. The lawyers for the rest of the defendants, including Melaku Fenta, former director general of ERCA, and Gebrewahed, his then deputy, did not make requests for bail. Instead, they complained that the prosecution's evidence was not submitted along with the charges, which fails to observe criminal law. Any arguments should take place after the prosecution forwards the evidence, they argued. The court accepted this argument and adjourned the case until next week, Tuesday, October 29, while also ordering the Commission to submit evidence by then. Defendants who are not granted release or bail will remain in prison until then. The charges on Meheretab Abraha and the company where he is a shareholder, MFAM Trading, were also read out in court this morning. The file includes five counts. MFAM is charged with failing to declare 3.5 million Br in taxes, and later failing to pay this tax when ordered by ERCA. Meheretab, who was manager of the company during this time, also has two counts for not taking action when the company failed to declare and later pay taxes. Another charge is also levied on him, this time for attempting to avoid the unpaid tax as legal. Meheretab's lawyer has argued that he has complaints on the criminal code articles his client was charged with, which the judges asked he file in writing. The case will be heard after this complaint is filed."462,The Daily Monitor,10/22/13,Uganda must get serious on corruption,,UGANDA (96%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,25-Jun-14,,649  words,CORRUPTION (95%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (90%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (89%); SCANDALS (89%); POLITICS (89%); APPOINTMENTS (89%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (79%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (79%); BRIBERY (78%); LAWYERS (77%); VERDICTS (75%); SUITS & CLAIMS (74%); WITNESSES (74%); ARRESTS (72%); JAIL SENTENCING (71%); LARCENY & THEFT (71%); LAW SCHOOLS (70%); HUMAN RIGHTS (70%); RANKINGS (70%); APPEALS (66%),"Government officials have made endless and strongly-worded promises to eradicate Uganda's endemic corruption. But the question remains: When will those commitments translate into concrete action, meaningful prosecutions of elites ... Government officials have made endless and strongly-worded promises to eradicate Uganda's endemic corruption. But the question remains: When will those commitments translate into concrete action, meaningful prosecutions of elites - such as political appointees and cabinet ministers - and jail time for those found guilty? Human Rights Watch and Yale Law School's Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic published research this week detailing how the highest-ranking members of Uganda's government have eluded prosecution for corruption, despite scandal after scandal. We interviewed knowledgeable people fighting corruption on the front lines and examined over 100 judgments from the Anti-Corruption Court. We found that, since its founding in 2009, the court has predominantly heard cases of ""small fish"" involving relatively small amounts of money, while the ""big fish"" have gone free. Out of several hundred cases, the court secured the conviction of just one high-level official, later overturned on appeal after President Museveni commented on the case. Lamenting the impunity of so-called ""untouchables,"" one prosecutor told us: ""Come rain, come shine, they're never going to court, not while there's somebody close to them in power. That's because of the politics involved."" We heard over and over again about political interference in cases involving elites. Politicians directed prosecutors to pursue certain cases and drop others. When instructions or bribes didn't work, they used threats to get lawyers and witnesses to see it their way. Over the past decade, international donors have pumped billions of dollars of aid into Uganda. Aid has slowed or halted because of high-profile corruption scandals, but resumes after largely cosmetic reforms. If the diverted money is returned to donor nations, that leaves Ugandans, particularly the poorest, without support to improve their lives and have access to essential services. After each scandal, international donors push the government to prosecute offenders, make reforms, and strengthen anti-corruption institutions. The government sometimes takes action - such as appointing the second deputy inspector general of government. But if Uganda's commitment to eradicating corruption is serious, anti-corruption institutions should be strong because it matters to Ugandans, not donors.  Vacancies in key positions shouldn't require pressure from the West to be filled.  And what reassurance is there that such vacancies won't cripple prosecutions in the future? Activists working to expose corruption and educate citizens about theft and diversion of state funds need public support. This year, 28 ""Black Monday"" activists have been arrested, some charged with inciting violence or unlawful assembly. This clampdown on information that should be publicly available calls into serious question the government's commitment to fighting corruption. Given Uganda's political patronage system and President Museveni's long stay in power, it has become highly unlikely that anything other than the prosecution of the high-ranking officials will fundamentally alter the deep-rooted patterns of graft and wealth accumulation by elites. Without substantial changes and follow-through on promises made, the injustices of Uganda's corruption problem will endure. Institutions are in place to combat corruption, but meaningful change can't happen without a sustained commitment from Ugandans themselves. Ugandans need to push both the government and donors to get serious about holding elites, including high ranking members of the government, accountable.

No surprise there, God's house has become one of the favourite hunting grounds for pickpockets and thieves. I was with a group of Ugandans when this theft was reported. What was revealing was the response of one of the good people I was with: ""...and I noticed the priest forgot to warn the people about thieves at the service,"" she said.I have been at church services where priests warned the flock of pickpockets. However, it seems the warnings are formally becoming part of services, and a priest or pastor's failure to warm worshippers about thieves among them, is almost equivalent to him failing to say the Lord's Prayer! One of the Kampala Sunday papers then had a front-page story on criminal gangs with fancy names operating in the capital. Someone told me the story was ""just the tip of the iceberg"". In other words, there are very many lesser-known gangs active in the city. I too lost my phone at a funeral. My own sense was that it had dropped out of my pocket and was lying somewhere in the grass. No, people who know better told me. They told me thieves scour newspapers and listen to radio announcements for funeral announcements. They then hire a matatu and target selected funerals - and indeed weddings. Most funerals and weddings in Uganda, they said, end in tears for quite a few attendees. Pickpockets and thieves have always been there in Uganda. What seems to be happening is that there is a dramatic escalation. Why is this expansion of theft happening?Even though I was a victim, I am still rational enough to understand that part of this theft is driven by urban poverty (poor villagers don't resort to theft so routinely). At a higher level, it is part of the wider class struggle between those who have and those who don't. But that is a very small part of the reason why we are seeing growing crime. The bigger reason was again illustrated on the weekend by a report on corruption on Uganda based on research by the New York-based advocacy group, Human Rights Watch, and the Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic of Yale University.It painted a bleak picture of corruption, saying that since President Yoweri Museveni came to power ""waves of scandals"" have hit his administration. The report faults Museveni personally for what it calls widespread ""bribery, nepotism, and misuse of official positions and resources"" in the country. Corruption has turned Uganda into a Mobutist state, where graft now accounts for most aspects of State failure. My sense is also that if you want to accurately predict how Museveni's regime will end, then study how corruption is working in Uganda today. One of the most successful foreign policy initiatives and military adventures of the Museveni government has to be its role in the African Union peacekeeping force for Somalia, Amisom. When no one dared, the Museveni government dispatched the UPDF to a Mogadishu that was still in the hands of al-Shabaab. They fought a long and brave campaign, paid very dearly, but together with Burundi that joined them later, they beat back the militants and made possible the establishment of the current government in Mogadishu. I thought because of what the UPDF mission meant for Africa, the world, and Uganda, it would become sacred...the one thing which would be insulated against the ugliness of Ugandan politics and power. I was wrong.We now know that commanders were stealing supplies for the troops and weapons and selling them to Somali bootleggers, and the very al-Shabaab militants they were fighting. Two things are happening here. One, the rampant corruption at the top over the years has led to what we might call a ""routinisation"" or ""normalisation"" of corruption.  Corruption and theft become the norm, integrity becomes the exception. But there is something else more fundamental at work. The spreading criminality is evidence of successful leadership from the Museveni government. A key element of political leadership is the ability of chiefs to get the country to follow their example, and to change national behaviour by rewarding and reinforcing the characteristics that they consider to be the best. Clearly, the government has done a first class of getting the country to follow is lead-by-theft example. Now public funds and assets are stolen. Votes are routinely stolen. Church collections are stolen. Soldiers' lives are stolen. Parliamentary voters are stolen. We steal each other's wives and husbands. Our children are violently robbed of their innocence. The Big Man hardly has any sense of shame and honour any more - I guess someone stole those too from him. cobbo@ke.nationmedia.com & twitter: cobbo3"466,The Herald (Harare),10/25/13,Anti-Corruption Commission Workers Attach Property,,ZIMBABWE (95%),Newspaper,Peter Matambanadzo,ENGLISH,,,25-Oct-13,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (93%)",500 words,"CORRUPTION (92%); APPROVALS (90%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (89%); ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (89%); APPEALS (89%); HUMAN RESOURCES (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); LABOR & EMPLOYMENT LAW (78%); COMMERCIAL PROPERTY (77%); APPEALS COURTS (76%); LAWYERS (73%); SHERIFFS (73%); INTELLIGENCE SERVICES (73%); MOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES (50%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Economy, Business and Finance","TWENTY-SIX investigators and intelligence officers employed by the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission have been given the green light to attach their employer's property to recover US$1,5 million owed to them in outstanding allowances and benefits. This comes after an arbitral award granted by arbitrator Mr Rogers Matsikidze early this year was successfully registered at the High Court. Justice Happias Zhou then issued a writ of execution allowing seven properties belonging to ZACC to be attached to recover the amount owed since 2009. ""You are required and directed to attach and take into execution the movable goods of Zimbabwe Anti Corruption Commission of the above mentioned respondents whose address is No. 872 Betterment Close, Mt Pleasant Business Park, Harare, Zimbabwe and of the same cause to be realised the sum of US$1 530 624 30, which claimants recovered by judgment of this Hounourable Court dated 17th October 2013,"" reads part of the writ, which was addressed to the deputy Sheriff of Zimbabwe. The writ also instructed the anti-graft body to pay the workers or their lawyer Mr Joel Mambara of Mambara and Partners the sum due to them with costs. According to the writ of execution, immovable property includes the ZACC head office in Mount Pleasant and six other properties in Harare. These are stand 386 Quinnington, Borrowdale measuring 4 000 square metres, a stand in Glen Lorne measuring 5373 square metres, a stand in Bluff Hill measuring 4515 square metres, two stands in Greendale measuring 6172 and 4148 square metres, and another stand in Northwood, Harare measuring 4047 square metres. According to court papers, ZACC failed to pay the workers housing, transport, cellphone and risk allowances as well as medical aid since November 2009 to date. The workers approached the Labour Court and were granted an award, which they subsequently registered. However, the commission appealed against the arbitral award in favour of the workers to be paid their allowance. But Labour Court president Mrs Lilian Kudya ruled last month that the commission was in contempt of court after it failed to comply with the court order to pay the 26 workers. She said the fact that the workers applied for registration of their award at the High Court had no effect on the award which has been appealed against in the court. In its grounds of appeal, the commission had maintained that it had not applied for a stay of the arbitral award pending appeal because the respondents filed an application with the higher court to register the award in question. In March this year, arbitrator Mr Matsikidze ruled in favour of the workers and awarded each of them various amounts ranging between US$53 000 and US$61 000. He said the commission's human resources section was in shambles and that it was unfairly treating its workers. In the award, Mr Matsikidze urged the commission to take care of the staff, saying poor working conditions and poor salaries might tempt them to engage in corrupt activities."467,The Daily Monitor,10/26/13,IGG investigating 100 cases of corruption in Karamoja region,,UGANDA (99%),Newspaper,Steven Ariong -1,ENGLISH,,,25-Jun-14,,395  words,CORRUPTION (93%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (78%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); ASSET FORFEITURE (68%); BUDGETS (62%),"The Inspectorate of government of Uganda is investigating 109 corruption cases in Karamoja sub-region.

The Inspectorate of government of Uganda is investigating 109 corruption cases in Karamoja sub-region.The Deputy Inspector General of Government (IGG),  Mr George Bamugemerere, revealed this during a workshop on the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (Nusaf) in Moroto Town on Wednesday. The workshop, organised by the Inspectorate of Government, was aimed at improving community livelihoods through efficient implementation of the second phase of Nusaf (Nusaf II). It was attended by the First Lady and Minister for Karamoja Affairs Janet Museveni, Nusaf Director Robert Limilim and leaders of Moroto and Napak districts. Insecurity problemMr Bamugemerere said corruption cases in Karamoja had accumulated due to the insecurity which could not allow the auditors to carry out auditing in the region. Karamoja has been ridden with insecurity mainly caused by armed cattle rustlers. ""Officials were swindling public funds and nobody could investigate them because of the insecurity,"" Mr Bamugemerere said. He said the corruption incidents under investigation by the IGG include cases in the first phase of Nusaf (Nusaf-I), National Agricultural Advisory Services (Naads) and Peace, Recovery and Development Plan (PRDP). ""The region is rotten and once we conclude our investigations, I don't think there will be any leader who will survive arrest,"" he said. Dr Robert Limlim, the director of Nusaf-II, appealed to the IGG to complete the investigations quickly and have culprits prosecuted. Dr Limlim, who comes from Karamoja, said the area has lagged behind in development because of corruption. He called for confiscation of property of the culprits to recover the stolen money. Mr Bamugemerere said under-funding is hindering the IGG's efforts to sufficiently investigate corruption cases and prosecute the culprits. He said the Shs30 billion the IGG office receives from government in the national budget annually is too inadequate. He called on the government to increase the funding to at least Shs40 billion to enable the IGG improve its performance. editorial@ug.nationmedia.com"468,Addis Fortune,10/27/13,Import Mogul Joins Corruption Fray,,ETHIOPIA (93%); AFRICA (73%),Newspaper,Elleni Araya,ENGLISH,,,29-Oct-13,,869 words,CORRUPTION (95%); TAX AUTHORITIES (90%); ETHICS (90%); TAX LAW (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (89%); WEALTHY PEOPLE (89%); TRANSPORTATION SUPPORT SERVICES (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (77%); INDICTMENTS (77%); SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES (77%); PUBLIC FINANCE (77%); MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTS (74%); SHAREHOLDERS (73%); EXCISE & CUSTOMS (71%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (71%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (71%); HOTELS & MOTELS (69%); PRIME MINISTERS (66%); FREIGHT BROKERS & FORWARDERS (56%); CONSTRUCTION (50%) Ethiopia; Trade; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Getu Gelete, founder and major shareholder of Get-As International Plc, became a last minute addition to the list of prominent businessmen recently implicated in a high-level corruption probe by the Federal Ethics & Anti Corruption Commission (FEACC). In his absence, he was named as defendant early last week in two of eight indictment files the Commission filed in court against tax officials, businessmen and freight forwarders as part of its corruption crackdown against the tax sector. As a defendant, Getu joins other prominent and wealthy businessmen included in these files, such as Ketema Kebede of K. K. Plc, Simachew Kebede of InterContinental Addis Hotel, Nega G. Egziabhere of Netsa Trading Plc, Fikru Maru (MD), who runs Addis Cardiac Hospital, and Gebreselassie H. Mariam of Comet Trading Plc. Except for Gebreselassie, the rest of these businessmen have been imprisoned since May, while the Commission was carrying out its investigations. The corruption crackdown, which has also engulfed senior tax officials including Melaku Fenta, former director general of the Ethiopian Revenues & Customs Authority (ERCA), and Gebrewahed W. Giorgis, his then-deputy, has been depicted several times both by the Commission's officials and Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn as a move on its own to signal the seriousness of government in taking a hard line against corruption. No matter what their affiliations are with government, there are no untouchables when it comes to fighting corruption, Hailemariam had said at several occasions since he came to power back in November 2012. Getu, whose company also owns the mixed-use Getu Commercial Centre on Africa Avenue (Bole Road), one of the five prime properties in Addis Abeba, supported the Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) during its election bid in 2005 and 2010. During the latter, he was part of a group of 60 business owners who mobilised a further 1,000 businesspersons to raise 20 million Br for the ruling party. A wealthy businessman with a modest beginning almost four decades ago, at his birth place 80Km south of Addis Abeba, Getu was also instrumental in raising funds from members of the private sector in Addis Abeba to finance the construction of the headquarters of the ruling EPRDF up at Arat Kilo, behind Parliament. This headquarters was designed by Begziyabher Alebel, an architect who is behind Ultimate Plans; the latter has been one of the suspects under the custody of federal authorities, and included in the probe in what the Administration of Hailemariam says was a network of high level graft, which embraces Getu beginning last week. Getu is now charged with eight counts of involvement in corrupt practices. His company, Get-As International Plc, a durable goods importing conglomerate, is also facing six counts of corruption as a separate legal entity. The businessman is to be tried in absentia as he is currently outside of the country, Fortune confirmed from sources. Family members were not available for comment on his whereabouts. In the first indictment file, Getu is charged for clearing imported goods using invoices without undergoing the mandatory inspections, through his personal connections with Melaku and Gebrewahed. These two, along with Ketema and Nega, also share this charge. The charges in the third file, however, are more numerous and include both the businessman and his company. Getu was one of the businessmen that transported cement which was imported duty free for government housing projects in Addis Abeba but later was sold to third parties, these charges read. While an investigation was launched on such transporters by the ERCA, a few, including Getu, Nega and Gebreselassie, were not included or indicted because of their connection to Gebrewahed, according to the charge. Getu sold 8,540ql of the 9,000ql of cement he imported, to a third party along with Gebreselassie, according to the charges, which also make Get-As International Plc criminally liable. In addition, the company is charged for not paying 22.8 million Br in profit tax from the import and sells of the cement sold to third parties, as well as money laundering, while Getu is charged as the general manager of Get-As International Plc, a company prosecutors indicted for failing to pay these taxes. Most of these charges, if found to be accurate, can lead to a sentencing of more than 10 years. Getu's case was heard at the Federal High Court's 15th Criminal Bench, on Chad St., in Lideta area, on Monday, October 21, and Tuesday, October 22, respectively. Upon request from the Commission's prosecutors, the bench has ordered that the investigation team of the Commission locate the whereabouts and summon the defendant at the next court date scheduled for October 29, 2013. This is not the first time Getu has been named as a defendant in a court of law. Federal prosecutors had charged him with fraud in 2010, following a contractual dispute with Helen Anbesso over a real estate property. But the charge was dropped later on after judges ruled that the suit was not one that was criminal in nature but a civil one. He was outside of the country when he was first summoned by the courts back then.tu Gelete"469,Addis Fortune,10/27/13,Over Br800 Million in Gov't Revenue Lost By Corruption Defendants - Commission Claims,,ETHIOPIA (93%); NETHERLANDS (79%),Newspaper,Elleni Araya,ENGLISH,,,29-Oct-13,,1734 words,"SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); PUBLIC FINANCE (90%); EXCISE & CUSTOMS (90%); TAX LAW (89%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); APPOINTMENTS (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); TAX AUTHORITIES (77%); VALUE ADDED TAX (77%); TRANSPORTATION SUPPORT SERVICES (77%); ETHICS (76%); INDICTMENTS (76%); TAX ENFORCEMENT (76%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (75%); TAXES & TAXATION (72%); WEALTHY PEOPLE (71%); HOTELS & MOTELS (69%); LABOR DEPARTMENTS (65%); PRIME MINISTERS (64%); FREIGHT BROKERS & FORWARDERS (56%) Ethiopia; Governance; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Economy, Business and Finance","For the first time since he was escorted to prison by Federal Police on a late Friday afternoon in early May, Melaku Fenta, then director general of the Ethiopian Revenues & Customs Authority (ERCA), was able to hear exactly what he and most of his colleagues at the helm of the Authority were implicated in. Indictment proceedings in the high profile corruption probe on the tax sector, which saw the arrest of over 60 tax officials, prominent businessmen, freight forwarders and their family members over the past six months, started on Monday, October 14, 2013. The nation's wealthy businessmen, Ketema Kebede of K. K. Plc, Simachew Kebede of InterContinental Addis Hotel, Nega G. Egziabhere of Netsa Trading Plc, Fikru Maru (MD) of Addis Cardiac Hospital, and new additions such as Gebreselassie H. Mariam of Comet Trading Plc and Getu Gelete, of Get-As International Plc, who is yet to be brought to court, were named as defendants in this trial, and stood alongside the public officials with whom they were accused of establishing connections for undue benefits. Maladministration, abuse of power and corrupt practices were rife within the ERCA during the time Melaku was director general of the institution between 2008 and 2012, was the gist of the numerous charges filed against him and his colleagues. Appointed first as a minister and director general when ERCA was reformed in 2008, Melaku came from a background in economics. Born in Gonder, he joined the ruling party in the early 1990s during the time when he had served the Ministry of Labour & Social Affairs. He was promoted to the Prime Minister's Office prior to 2000s, responsible for handling the affairs of the newly formed regional states. It was this background that eventually led to his appointment as a state minister of Federal Affairs, under Abay Tsehaye, then its minister, and one of the ideologues of the EPRDF to date. Transferred to the tax and customs sector in the mid-2000s, Melaku was trained in The Netherlands, where he received his post graduate degree in customs and revenues. He has seen through the reforms of the nation's tax regime and the introductions of schemes such as automation, VAT and sales register machines which are now numbered close to 63,000. First elected to the EPRDF Central Committee in 2006, he has been one of the most powerful government officials in whose watch the nation's domestic revenue mobilization drive jumped from 19 billion Br before his appointment in 2008 to 84.2 billion Br in 2012/13. Despite these successes, however, his period at ERCA has created a ground for many businessmen and their companies to underpay taxes, perpetuate fraud and avoid criminal liability through graft, accuses the Federal Ethics & Anticorruption Commission (FEACC). Its prosecutors now claim this had led the government to lose nearly 795 million Br in revenue, with 667 million Br down to unpaid taxes and revenues that should have been credited to the public coffer, while the balance is the tally of what the abuse of power has cost the government in general, according to officials from the Commission. How and when these losses were incurred tax notice to pay took a long time to process. Melaku, allegedly reduced nearly 100,000 Br outside of procedure for Mekdes, with whom he established a romantic relationship. Using public property to travel with her was also cited in the charge. Similarly for Gebrewahed, charges that startled the public were included in the third file. In this, Gebrewahed is accused of corrupt practices, including calling and threatening businessmen to pay bribes in return for dropping legal charges and reducing taxes. A specific instance mentioned in the charge is the case of Baheru Abreha, shareholder of Bisrat Plc, which operates Elfign Baheru Corrugated Iron Sheets Factory. While Baheru was under prosecution by the ERCA for allegedly conducting business transactions without VAT receipts, Gebrewahed allegedly called and threatened him to pay bribes or face maximum sentencing. He then met Baheru through the facilitation of Nega G. Egziabhere, in Yordanos Hotel, and took 250,000 Br in bribes, the charge reads. While taking the money, he then spotted a gold bracelet on Baheru's wrist and asked that he receive a similar kind, which Baheru gave him the next day, when the met inside InterContinental Addis Hotel, according to the charge. Other ERCA officials, including Markneh Alemayehu, former prosecutor for ERCA, are also accused of taking 100,000 Br in bribes and dropping the case for Baheru. Gebrewahed is also charged with possession of nine unlicensed weapons - Kalashnikov, Colt and Makarov - possession of goods from unknown sources and money laundering. While Gebrewahed and his wife had a salary of between 247 Br to 5,700 Br and 790 Br to 2,145 Br, respectively, throughout their working years, Gebrewahed was allegedly found to have 1.4 million Br in several bank accounts under his, his wife and children's names. This is in addition to being in possession of money in five different currencies, six laptops as well as property in Legetafo area, on the outskirts of Addis Abeba, in Oromia Regional State. Melaku was also accused of a similar charge for having nearly 3.2 million Br in cash and assets, including a two-storey house on a 659sqm plot that is estimated to worth 1.5 million Br. The charge for most of the wealthy businessmen was also included in the third file. The companies these businessmen run, including Ketema's K. K. Plc, Simachew's G. H. Tsemex Plc, Nega's Netsa Trading Plc, Getu's Get-As International Plc and Gebreselassie's Comet Trading Plc were also indicted as separate legal entities. The audit report of these companies reveals that nearly 237 million Br due to the government has not been paid, according to officials from the Commission. Most of the businessmen running these companies are accused of having charges and investigations on them and their companies dropped through graft. Ketema, for instance, was accused of having his loan-sharking charges dropped due to his special relationship with Melaku established for undue benefits. Simachew, on the other hand, is charged with having investigations on his alleged use of machinery and furniture imported duty free for the hotel, for other purposes, dropped. Similar investigations against Fikru, who was accused of an attempt to pass medical equipments which were not allowed through the customs, were also terminated for undue benefits by officials, according to the charges. Additionally, Nega, Getu and Gebreselassie, who allegedly transported cement imported for government housing projects to third parties, had investigations and charges against them dropped because of their affiliations with Gebrewahed and other officials, the charge reads. Gebrewahed and Woldeselassie W. Michael, a senior national security officer at the time, tried to twist testimonies of others and put the blame on three other companies involved in the transport of the cement, without bringing liability to the above-mentioned businessmen, the charge reads. Not much was heard from the defendant's side during court proceedings because prosecutors at the Commission did not submit evidence along with the indictments. Many of the defendants' lawyers appealed to the judges that they first read the evidence before making pre-trial arguments. Few of the defendants spoke, including Markneh. ""Not submitting evidence along with charges is outside of procedure,"" he voiced his complaints. ""Why did the court's registrar accept and seal the charges if they are incomplete in the first place?"" The judges took these arguments in consideration and ruled that during their next appearance, prosecutors bring in evidence. The hearing for the three indictment files were adjourned until October 29 with a strict admonishment from the bench that prosecutors should bring evidence next time. Markneh also appealed to the court to monitor media and request that they present their stories in summarised manner. ""If they do go into the details, it should be balanced,"" he appealed to the court. The bench deferred judgment on the matter for sometime but reminded reporters to write balanced news until such judgement is passed. Since most of the charges levied against defendants are punishable by 10 or more years of imprisonment, only three of the defendants, Semere Negussie, the Ethiopian Revenues & Customs Authority's (ERCA) Adama Branch container inspection official at Modjo Dry Port & Terminal, Mareshet Tesfaye from M.D. Freight-Forwarding, and Dawit Mekonnen, a self-employed broker, were granted on bail for 15,000 Br. No bail was granted in the second and third charge files. Outside of the three indictment files, however, Meheretab Abreha, brother of former TPLF strongman Seeye, was charged with corruption and not paying taxes along with the company he manages, MFAM Plc. Meheretab, along with Begziabhere Alebel, an architect and shareholder in the design firm, Ultimate Plan Plc, and businessmen Tekleab Zerabruk and Fitsum Gebremedhin, were not indicted with the rest of the businessmen they were initially detained with a month and a half ago. Instead, the Commission's investigators were asking more time to complete audit reports of the suspects' companies until last week. While Fitsum and Meheretab were charged, Begziabhere and Tekleab remain unindicted. The Commission itself has let out Tekleab on bail, whereas the court granted Begziabhere a 100,000 Br bond for bail last week, after the Commission's investigators announced that his case does not fall under their jurisdiction but that of the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) instead. It is not clear whether the MoJ will take over Begziabhere's case, nor has he been released from police custody. He is counted as a witness in the first count of the first indictment file, along with Eshetu Woldesemayat, chief prosecutor at the ERCA, who was initially arrested along with the rest of the ERCA officials, to testify against Melaku, Gebrewahid and Ketema. As Melaku et al. were being escorted out of the court on Wednesday the Commission's prosecutors, Ayele Tessema, Getachew Aga and Endale Tsegaye, stayed behind to participate in the hearing for the rest of the seven files, which include mid-level customs officials and businessmen from Adama, Mille and Dire Dawa.

However, the East African Bribery Index 2013 still finds Uganda leading the East African region in prevalence of bribery despite a series of laws mooted to combat the vice. Burundi comes second at 18.6 per cent. Tanzania and Kenya were the only countries to make progress in the anti-graft fight in the region, moving down a spot each, albeit with relatively lower aggregates. In 2012, Tanzania and Kenya posted 39.1 per cent and 29.5 per cent respectively. Though Rwanda maintained position five as the country with the least bribery incidences in the region, it was the only country to post an increased aggregate from 2.5 per cent last year to 4.4 per cent this year. Bribery proneThe report makes a particularly damning assessment at the police, with the Force ranked as the most bribery-prone institution in the country at 60 per cent as well as boasting of the highest prevalence of bribery at 47.8 per cent. Lands services and the Judiciary came in at position two and three, with an aggregate score of 46.7 per cent and 42.0 per cent respectively. And bribing a police officer does not come cheaply, with the average bribe an officer will take estimated at Shs900,000, according to the report.Yesterday, police spokesperson Judith Nabakooba did not respond to or return repeated phone calls. But Judiciary spokesman Erias Kisawuzi dismissed the findings as based on ""perceptions"". ""I have not had a copy of the report but be that as it may, these are perception reports. I do not know whether its respondents reflected a cross section of Ugandans,"" Mr Kisawuzi said. The report further reveals that the police rake in 27 per cent of the bribes that exchange hands in Uganda.With the police, which is mandated to enforce the law, largely incriminated by the report, it is little wonder that 93 per cent of respondents in Uganda said they did not report the bribery cases they encountered. Victims of bribery, according to the report, opted to remain silent because they knew no action would be taken to resolve their complaint. sarinaitwe@ug.nationmedia.com"471,The Herald (Harare),11/7/13,Mohadi Hails Stance Against Corruption,,ZIMBABWE (96%); ZAMBIA (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,7-Nov-13,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (92%)",433 words,CORRUPTION (92%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (88%); ELECTIONS (79%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (79%); LOBBYING (79%); EXECUTIVES (78%); POLICE FORCES (78%); TOURISM DEVELOPMENT (70%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (70%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (63%); REFERENDUMS (60%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (60%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"GOVERNMENT has commended the police for its zero tolerance against corruption which has resulted in a number of officers being discharged from the force after being caught on the wrong side of the law.

He was speaking at the Zimbabwe Republic Police 2013 Senior Officers Conference in Harare. Minister Mohadi said corrupt activities denied the people justice and retarded development. ""Accordingly, as the Ministry we are grateful to the command of the Zimbabwe Republic Police for maintaining a zero tolerance to corruption among police officers as well as members of the public. Quite a number of police officers who were caught on the wrong side of the law were discharged from the police service, a feat which mirrors the organisation's commitment to rid itself of unprincipled police officers,"" he said. Minister Mohadi commended members of the public for their unwavering support to the police. ""It is important, therefore, that the police officers retain that support and trust from the members of the public by conducting themselves, as they discharge their duties on a high moral platform,"" said Minister Mohadi. ""The society expects police officers to lead exemplary and unblemished lives, hence members of the organisation should shun all forms of corruption."" Minister Mohadi said Government was mindful of the fact that policing the world over was an expensive exercise which required meaningful and constant injection of material and financial resources. He said the ministry would tirelessly lobby for resources to ameliorate challenges being faced by the force. These include shortage of transport, office and residential accommodation and poor remuneration. Minister Mohadi said apart from protecting lives and property, the force was expected to consistently support Government efforts to alleviate poverty and improve the lives of the people. He called the force to ensure a peaceful and tranquil environment in which the Government's new economic blue print, the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation (ZimAsset) could be implemented.

Isn't it surprising that in this 21st Century, Uganda still depends entirely on cash for goods and services. On a recent trip to Uganda, the team I travelled with asked whether credit and debit cards would be used in restaurants or shops.  I told them that Uganda is still a cash economy and therefore cash would be the quickest option to access services and products. Isn't it surprising that in this 21st Century, Uganda still depends entirely on cash for goods and services. For instance, you need cash in your wallet to fill your vehicle tank, buying groceries in a supermarket, buying drugs or getting medical attention in hospitals, eating out, and so on. Cash-based economies describedCash economies are liquid, quicker, and also increase the money supply especially in countries where financial systems are shallow and with limited outreach. However, majority of places where card payments are unacceptable, corruption and bribery may be very rampant, simply because cash doesn't leave any trails behind. Could this be the more reason, corruption seems normal to us in Uganda? Have you ever noticed that when you go to a petrol station and request for a receipt, the pump attendant will normally ask the buyer what figures/he should write on the receipt? In the financial world, this is termed as fraud.  But imagine if you had paid using a card, the receipt would definitely have the details of the transaction which would help in balancing the books at the end of the day. This can eventually lead to tax evasion through understating cash receipts or overstating their business expenses. Cash economies can also be manipulative. The corporate class that religiously file their returns monthly to Uganda Revenue Authority contribute enormously to the development of the nation through tax payments. The collected taxes are then used for the public deliverables like roads, hospitals, and defence that are eventually enjoyed by the majority that never get taxed because there are operating using cash that cannot be trailed - no surveillance.  Isn't this selective taxing? Do we know how much income and economic activity goes unrecorded when cash is used for transactions? Money laundering havenMoney laundering is widespread in cash based economies due to lack of controls with cash transactions. How often, do you get asked the source of funds when purchasing a property in Ntinda or anywhere else? The majority of these property transactions are paid in cash. Property acquisition is the most preferred channel for money laundering and you don't need a prophet to confirm this - just look at the next mall or estate that is coming up in your neighbourhood. What is the origin of this cash and why pay in cash and not a cheque or a transfer? What drives cash based economies? Different factors like, deficiencies in technology, a large unbanked population , low income levels, high levels of illiteracy, weak institutions and legislations etc. If we encouraged more payments through electronic media, don't you think this would even save the tax payer more money in printing bank notes? Shouldn't we as Ugandans invest more in research & development especially in technology, encourage filing of annual tax returns for all citizens including the self employed? Investing more in electronic card readers in common business centres like restaurants, legal chambers, hospitals, supermarkets, petrol stations, among others would go a long way in fighting crime in the country. Maybe, we should all work collectively towards making Uganda a better place - crime free and less corruption. Knowing the start and end of every transaction can curb corruption in our country.

But I would bet the biggest problem we have is lack of transparency and accountability among members of farming households. Bags of coffee are sold, a pig is sold, trees are felled and sold; but how is the money spent? Who keeps that money? Who decides what to be done with the money? Do both the husband and wife have equal say over that money? Are their grown up children included in the decision making? Does everybody in the home share a sense of ownership over its farming activities? When money meant to be used for the common good of the community is taken secretly and used selfishly by individuals to satisfy personal desires, we describe such behaviour as corruption. Distrust sets inIt resembles what is reported to have taken place in Office of the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Public Service, Global Fund, CHOGM and the rest. When a member of a household secretly or openly spends money earned through the toil of all family members to satisfy personal desires, he or she is not different from those individuals that steal funds from public institutions. The results can be very grave. The rest of the family members get demoralised and stop working as hard as they should. In case of a poultry farm, for example, the rest of the family members may stop taking good care of the birds after discovering that the father spends the money earned from the farm on alcohol and prostitutes. They may also resort to selling the eggs or the chickens without his knowledge to earn some money for buying text books or clothing. Distrust sets in, profit and loss accounts fail to add up, and finally the poultry project crumbles. Issues of gender equity in farming must be addressed together with all other problems facing agriculture today--biotic or abiotic--to improve production. ssalimichaelj@gmail.com"475,The Daily Monitor,11/22/13,"Address the issue of corruption, corporate companies urged",,"UGANDA (93%); AFRICA (90%); EASTERN AFRICA (90%); KENYA (79%); BURUNDI (79%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (79%)",Newspaper,EPHRAIM KASOZI -1,ENGLISH,,,25-Jun-14,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (93%)",322  words,MONEY LAUNDERING (92%); FINANCIAL CRIME COUNTERMEASURES (91%); CORRUPTION (90%); CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (89%); ETHICS (78%); CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (78%); CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (77%); BUSINESS ETHICS & CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP (77%); TALKS & MEETINGS (73%); STRATEGIC PLANNING (72%); BEST PRACTICES (72%); CONSULTING SERVICES (71%),"He warned against the persistent money laundering cases and its effect on small economies but commended Parliament for enacting the new anti-money laundering law.

Five of the six defendants in his file were also found guilty on the corruption charge. The corruption charges were related to the bidding procedure for the construction of three educational institutions at a total cost of 83 million Br, during Yaregal's presidency of the Benishangul Gumuz Regional State. The Federal Ethics & Anti Corruption Commission (FEACC) took the case to court two years ago, claiming the former regional president had a corrupt involvement in the construction of the Tana Beles Women's Boarding school, Gilgel Beles Teachers Training Collage and the Assosa Technical & Vocational Training Centre. These projects were awarded to Gedion Demeke Consulting Firm, Gad Construction and Colon Construction in a closed tender, however, they should have been conducted openly according to the region's construction directive amended in 2000 which requires open tenders for projects worth more than 300,000 Br. Those closed tenders led to the loss of seven million Birr, the Commission claimed, because of payments given outside of contractual agreements. Yaregal was also prosecuted on four other counts, including the collection of a large amount of wealth from an unknown source, as well as committing fraud while registering assets under his possession. However, he was cleared of these charges. The Federal High Court had frozen the assets of the defendant back in October 2011. These include a house built on 1,204sqm of land and a total of 4,132sqm of additional land in the region he led; a 500sqm plot in Bole District in Addis Abeba and a one-storey house resting on 500sqm in Oromia Regional State. On top of this, there was also a restaurant registered in his wife's name and a 1,490sqm plot in Benishangul Gumuz registered in the name of one of his children. In the hearing that took place on Wednesday, November 20, and Thursday, November 21, the judges read 170 pages of the charge file on the other six defendants under his file. The corruption count involved all six, which are Habtamu Hika, Regional Education Bureau head; Gedion Demeke, general manager of the Gedion Demeke Consulting Firm; Assefa Gebeyehu, agent at Gedion; Gezahegn Adgeh, general manager of Gad Construction; Mekbib Mogesse, general manager of Colon Construction, and Hailegebriel Hika, a businessman who is the brother of Habtamu. Among all these defendants, only Hailegebriel, who was attending court while out on bail, was acquitted. He was suspected of amassing wealth from an unknown source by using the powers and privileges of his brother in office as a cover. The Bench, however, acquitted him on Thursday, following his defense that that the wealth was generated though long years of saving.

Kampala- The reduction of the country's forest cover is due to failure by government to implement laws, leading to persistent illegal timber trade in the country, anti-corruption crusaders have said. Under their umbrella body, Anti-Corruption Coalition Uganda (ACCU), the activists attributed the lack of implementation of the laws to meager resources allocated to the forestry sector which makes officials unable to supervise activities. According to the National Forest Authority (NFA), forests in Uganda contribute 5.7 per cent to the Gross domestic Product with a significant contribution found in the service roles including climate change mitigation, stabilisation of water supplies for domestic and agricultural use and soil conservation. Ms Cissy Kagaba, the ACCU Executive Director, argued that money allocated to the forestry sector is not enough for the officials to monitor all forests, leading to illegal acquisition of forests. ""The certificates to permit timber harvesting are vague because they are not specific to tree species nor space to be harvested, which makes it easy for tree cutters to manipulate. These permits are not clear and they are issued without following the lawful procedure,"" said Ms Kagaba, accusing officials of conniving with timber harvesters. According to Ms Kagaba, the declining forest cover is as a result of the high level of impunity which has weakened the officials charged with protecting the country's forests. ""A solution to this continued exploitation of the forestry sector is to increase budget allocation and desist from politicising the sector because this has led to invasion of the forests,"" she added. Mayuge has the highest deforestation rate with a 99.8 per cent loss of forest cover since 1990, this is followed by Wakiso at 86 per cent. In the north, Amuru has the highest forest cover at 3.3 per cent. In the west and eastern parts of the country, the forest cover is high in Kabarole at 22.6 per cent and 33.3 per cent in Bukwo.

President Mugabe has called for zero tolerance to corruption, which is a problem we need to face head-on. It has become so ingrained in some of our institutions that some people believe that bribes are their rightful dues. Corruption bleeds the economy as resources meant to benefit ordinary citizens end up stashed in the pockets of a few ruthless individuals. Some foreign-owned companies siphon revenue into offshore accounts. Just getting service from some Government departments is frustrating as you are expected to fork out a bribe. Yet these are all funded through taxes paid by the ordinary citizen supposed to fork out a kickback. In the past many calls for the curbing of corruption have been made but it appears that the will and intention largely remained on parallel tracks. Some VID and traffic police officers from the national and municipal forces have repeatedly and publicly been declared as being very corrupt. Yet it appeared that those in charge could only watch helplessly while hapless motorists and other civilians were fleeced by some dishonest law enforcement officers. The inertia was puzzling, leading to speculation that the rot went all the way to the top. We need a new culture where corruption is not tolerated and the only way to do that is to send an unequivocal message that perpetrators will be caught and prosecuted. That is why we hope that these two developments signal a new era where the axe falls on perpetrators. The setting up of CCTV by the municipal authorities demonstrates a resolution to tackle the problem and we highly recommend the resourcefulness of whoever came up with the idea. We hope that the sweep in the two organisations is just the beginning. We hope to see more offenders named, shamed and punished, irrespective of their position and status. Let this not be the usual pretence where a few sacrificial lambs are offered before the campaign fizzles out. The efforts must be sustained, consistent and know no sacred cows. We hope those in charge of these institutions are serious about rooting out corruption and the public will soon be reaping the rewards of that as services are granted fairly. And it must not stop with the VID and Harare Municipal Police. Corruption is a cancer that has spread throughout the body of the country's operations and no single state arm can be said to be clean. The Registrar-General's Passport Office, ZRP Traffic and nurse training institutions deserve special mention as perceived bastions of corruption. Our columnist Mai Jukwa called for renewal in parastatal leadership at a time when some bosses have overstayed. ZBC is a case in point where the management and the board are alleged to have awarded themselves huge perks while the organisation became mired in debt, resulting in workers going for months without pay. We hope the forensic audit that Information, Media and Broadcasting Services Minister Professor Jonathan Moyo ordered at ZBC Holdings is already being carried out and the results will be made public soon. We also hope that similar sweeps will be executed at other under-performing state enterprises. There are several other places where Zimbabweans would like to see effective results, not the announcement of intentions: What happened to the call for a financial and means audit for police officers? What is the ZRP doing about their traffic police who stop the same kombis everyday without any apparent improvement in passenger safety? Why are touts back in the commuter omnibus ranks? What happened to the former MPs who reportedly abused the Constituency Development Funds during the tenure of the GNU? Were the accounts that they presented ever audited to verify the claims that they made? The list is endless and we intend to keep asking until we get answers."481,The Daily Monitor,12/1/13,Corruption in Uganda is not a flu but a cancer,,UGANDA (94%),Newspaper,George Kanyeihamba -1,ENGLISH,,,25-Jun-14,,762  words,CORRUPTION (92%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); INFLUENZA (90%); CANCER (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); AIDS & HIV (77%),"In one of their campaign slogan posters, the Anti-Corruption League proclaims ""Do not catch the corruption flu.

Few people in Uganda today deny any more that the cancer of corruption is not only endemic but under the NRMO party government, it has spread nationwide and is accepted, if not encouraged, but has become the main political support machine of the ruling oligarchy. A country built on and sustained by corruption is like a house built on quick sand. Time will come, not later but sooner when a small wind blowing dissent will come and obliterate the sand and take with it those who foolishly constructed the house on sand. At one function which I attended and introduced President Museveni, who was the chief guest, I remarked that unless he and the government seriously fought against and marginalised corruption, the good deeds and record of his victorious speech when he first came to power on the strength of the barrel of the gun that his was not a mere change of guards but a fundamental change, will, if not already, be recorded in history as a sick political joke. However, on that particular function, the President agreed with my predication but protested very strongly that it could not endure under his leadership.  He explained, ""Prof Kanyeihamba is, however, wrong, the NRM has defeated the bandits such as Kony, who were heavily armed how can we fail to defeat the corrupt, who are unarmed?"" The President's question is very simple to answer. He and his government have totally failed to fight corruption. Several of his ministers and many more NRM party cadres and supporters are alleged to be thoroughly corrupt. President Museveni himself has publicly named many of them, but he continues relying on them for his prolongation in political office. Many Ugandans believe he is frightened of them. It is common knowledge amongst many of his ministers, party cadres and supporters that he is so much sustained by the corrupt in office that it is near impossible for him to survive politically without them. In the meantime, dozens and dozens of his former comrades and supporters have abandoned his corrupt-ridden political ship to wage war against it and piece gaping holes in its hull. The most important principle enshrined in the 1995 Constitution is that power is vested in the people who must be governed by their consent through their freely cast votes in elections or referenda or duly elected representatives. For decades now, the NRMO party has persistently but fatally undermined the same principle and governed by whims of the minority ruling class through mainly ignorance, fanaticism and greed all-trapped and propelled by intolerance and misrule. Most, if not all the fundamental safeguards enshrined in the Constitution, have been removed or stripped naked by an intolerant Executive. The fatal cancers of Kony and other groups of rebels against President Museveni and the NRMO party have not gone away. Like cancer cells, they are in hidden corners of the body in Uganda and Africa, anxiously waiting for the day when he and his band of corrupt singers are sufficiently weakened and hated by the anger of Ugandans, when they will strike back and seize power with no visible prospects that they will do any better or behave differently. There seems to be a curse thrust upon the destinies of the people and fortunes of the Pearl of Africa.

""The Corruption Perceptions Index 2013 demonstrates that all countries still face the threat of corruption at all levels of government, from the issuing of local permits to the enforcement of laws and regulations,"" said Huguette Labelle, Chair of Transparency International. Denmark and New Zealand tie for first place with scores of 91. Afghanistan, North Korea and Somalia this year make up the worst performers, scoring just eight points each. ""The top performers clearly reveal how transparency supports accountability and can stop corruption,"" said Labelle. ""Still, the better performers face issues like state capture, campaign finance and the oversight of big public contracts which remain major corruption risks."" The Corruption Perceptions Index is based on experts' opinions of public sector corruption. Countries' scores can be helped by strong access to information systems and rules governing the behaviour of those in public positions, while a lack of accountability across the public sector coupled with ineffective public institutions hurts these perceptions. ""It is time to stop those who get away with acts of corruption. The legal loopholes and lack of political will in government facilitate both domestic and cross border corruption, and call for our intensified efforts to combat the impunity of the corrupt,"" said Labelle."484,The Namibian (Windhoek),12/5/13,Corruption Hits Ariamsvlei Border Post,,NAMIBIA (92%); ZIMBABWE (92%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,5-Dec-13,,286 words,CORRUPTION (95%); IMMIGRATION (92%); PASSPORTS & VISAS (90%); TERRITORIAL & NATIONAL BORDERS (90%); ARRESTS (90%); BRIBERY (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); LITIGATION (78%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (77%); TEXT MESSAGING (71%); MOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES (71%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (64%) Namibia; Corruption; Migration,"AN immigration official stationed at the Ariamsvlei border post in the //Karas Region was arrested by officers of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) last Monday for alleged corruption.

This was after a member of the public had alerted the police and the ACC of the act. They also allegedly exchanged cellphone text messages. Confirming the arrest on Tuesday, the police commander in the //Karas Region, Commissioner Armas Shivute, said Ncube offered Godfried N$230 in exchange of an extra 36 days to be put on his visa.

In a ministerial policy statement made in Parliament yesterday, Mr Kabimba also announced that Government would build more than six High Courts in selected parts of the country. He said the ministry would endeavour to uphold the rule of law and ensure justice for all next year. He said the ministry was determined to increase access to justice through construction of court buildings and the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure. Mr Kabimba said the Lusaka High Court building would be expanded, while other High Courts would be built in Chipata, Kabwe, Mongu, Choma, Mansa and Mazabuka. He said plans were also underway to construct High Courts in Chiengi, Chama and Chirundu. Mr Kabimba said that construction and rehabilitation of subordinate courts as well as outright purchase of buildings was underway to ensure quick disposal of court cases. He said his ministry would also continue to train staff to promote efficient delivery of justice in the country. United Party for National Development (UPND) Lukulu West Member of Parliament (MP) Misheck Mutelo said it was sad that corruption had found itself in courts of law. MMD Nalikwanda MP Geoffrey Lungwangwa called for independence of the Judiciary from the Executive so that it could uphold democratic principles. UPND Kalomo MP Request Muntanga called for renewed efforts in fighting corruption in the Judiciary. He said it was unfortunate that corruption had been noted in the Judiciary which was a noble wing of Government. In his response, Mr Kabimba said Government had a good programme to improve the disposal of cases. He said the Government was also working on modalities to upgrade the existing legal aid system so that the poor people could access justice.

The Corruption Perception Index is based on experts' opinions of public sector corruption, and countries' scores can be helped by strong access to information systems and rules governing the behaviour of those in public positions; while a lack of accountability across the public sector - coupled with ineffective public institutions - hurt these perceptions. According to a release byTransparency International Sierra Leone, this year's CPI indicates that although the country improved in rank, its score reduced slightly in terms of progress made in the fight against sleaze. The organization noted that the reduction in score is a pointer to the fact that tremendous effort is still needed by government and citizens to curb graft, which, it said, is gradually becoming a prevalent norm in society and that despite the numerous efforts made to proactively address this scourge, public officials and those in positions of trust have decided to carry on with ""business as usual"". ""The sources of data used for the rank and score for Sierra Leone were mainly derived from eight (8) sources (surveys). Transparency International Sierra Leone is of the firm conviction that unless and until corruption is effectively addressed and there is the will, determination and commitment across all sectors of society to effectively contribute to curb this menace, Sierra Leone's stride towards prosperity will remain a dream,"" it stated. The organization therefore urged government/public officials both at the national and local level to strive to demonstrate and be committed to a high level of integrity and patriotism in the execution of their duties, and to demonstrate the willingness to curb corruption to ensure that the country's development process will be meaningful to every Sierra Leonean. ""We also continue to urge the general citizenry and civil society organizations to be more proactive and supportive in the fight against corruption, and more especially to refrain from any act that could condone it and to report any such known act,"" it concluded."487,The Herald (Harare),12/10/13,'Let's Promote a Corruption-Free Zimbabwe',,ZIMBABWE (96%); NETHERLANDS (79%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,10-Dec-13,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (91%)",339 words,CORRUPTION (96%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); CURRICULA (78%); PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS (74%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (69%) Zimbabwe; Corruption,"PUBLIC-private partnerships, transparent policies and public awareness campaigns are key to the total eradication of corruption, African Parliamentarians Network Against Corruption chairperson Mr Willias Madzimure has said.

Ethiopia's score on the index is 33, which is the same as 2012 and ranks it 111th out of 177 countries surveyed. The index yet again categorizes Ethiopia as a highly corrupt country. On the other hand, Ethiopia is also at the forefront of countries registering rapid economic growth. It launched the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) in 2010 to achieve its stated goal of joining the rank of middle-income nations by 2025. Accordingly, it is undertaking unprecedented and highly ambitious projects towards this end. The 6000 Megawatt Grand Renaissance Dam being built on the Blue Nile, a river which has not been harnessed despite its considerable potential, the national railway line being built in different parts of the country, the Addis Ababa Light Rail Train project, and ten sugar factories are part of the mega-projects intended to achieve the bold targets set by the GTP. Aside from these, a host of foreign companies are eyeing Ethiopia with a view to tapping its vast natural resources and other opportunities. All in all, the country is showing tangible economic growth across all sectors. It is, indeed, a paradox that Ethiopia ranks among the top in the rate of economic growth and the prevalence of corruption. This state of affairs is particularly unacceptable given that we find ourselves at a decisive moment in our history as a nation. Hence, we have to bear in mind that unless we resolutely combat corruption, one of the biggest impediments to development, the ambitious plans we have set out to accomplish, will remain a pipedream. It has been some time now since the government of Ethiopia declared poverty the topmost enemy of the country and waged war on it. Admittedly, there are signs that poverty can indeed be eradicated from Ethiopia. For instance, a recently released study found that Ethiopia beat all other countries in terms of the rate at which it produced millionaires in the past year. This testifies to the fact that the country is laying down the foundation for economic growth that has allowed many to become wealthy and improved the livelihood of millions of others. Thus, if Ethiopians do whatever it is within their power there is no reason why poverty cannot become a thing of the past. The rampant corruption prevailing in the country, however, threatens to undo the gains it has made on the economic front. The late Prime Minister Meles Zenawi once acknowledged the existence of corrupt elements within the ranks of the government, but passed away soon after. His successor, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, pledged to bring to justice these elements as he assumed office, and true to his word a number of senior government officials and employees were prosecuted on corruption charges this year. The fact that the majority of the accused are the top officials of the tax authority and prominent businesspersons reaffirms that corruption is one of the arch enemies of the nation and its people. The periodic reports of the Federal Auditor General regarding its investigation into the books of the federal government's various institutions are further proof of the level of corruption in Ethiopia. The measures the government are merely the tip of the iceberg. The Auditor General's reports have shown time and again that numerous government institutions are guilty of gross financial and property mismanagement. These reports have not resulted in the slew of indictments that should have been instituted by now. That they have not is a failure which needs to be addressed promptly. In any democratic nation, voters elect their government to serve them to the best of their ability. Accordingly, the government has to ensure that the sole yardstick it uses to appoint officials to positions of responsibility is merit. After all, a country must not be governed by officials who are appointed for the sake of taking a stab at ruling. Hence, government officials or employees who mismanage public monies and property should not be just moved laterally; they have to be held accountable on corruption charges for their misdeeds if the country is not to be derailed from its journey on the path to development."493,The New Times (Kigali),12/27/13,Institutions in Coalition to Eliminate Corruption,,RWANDA (94%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%),Newspaper,Susan Babijja,ENGLISH,,,27-Dec-13,,436 words,"CORRUPTION (94%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (89%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (89%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); BRIBERY (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (78%); BUSINESS & PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS (73%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (71%); ECONOMIC NEWS (66%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (51%) Rwanda; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Economy, Business and Finance","A coalition bringing together various institutions has been formed to intensify the fight against corruption, especially in public procurement.

""Given the areas of interventions by the members of the coalition, I am sure that this initiative will effectively contribute to the fight against corruption, especially because it brings together key players in the private sector,"" she said. Cyanzayire said fighting corruption should not be left to the government but that it must be a collective responsibility given its negative impact not only to national development, but also on common folks at the grassroots. She said graft hinders economic development and denies citizens the chance to benefit from opportunities created by government, which plunges them into poverty. Coalition mandate Members of the coalition will have the responsibility of sharing relevant information concerning corruption cases, according to the memorandum of understanding. The coalition aims at establishing the partnership between the partner institutions with the purpose of ensuring that public tenders are issued and executed through a transparent, participatory approach and with accountability in the planning, bidding, awarding, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the contracts tendered for. Marie Immacule Ingabire, the chairperson of Transparency International Rwanda, commended the initiative, saying it promotes and encourages other stakeholders in development to address the issues of corruption. ""It is our obligation to detect and report cases of corruption in order to ensure zero tolerance for graft in every sector,"" she said. In October, Transparency International released the East African Bribery Index 2013, which indicated that despite Rwanda being the least corrupt country in the region, its index nearly double from 2.5 per cent in 2012 to 4.4 per cent in 2013.

Hanse said he expects to arrive in Windhoek tomorrow afternoon. ""I am just a simple manservant who wants to take the dirty laundry of Kalkrand to the washing machine of the President (Hifikepunye Pohamba) and Namoloh (Local Government Minister Charles Namoloh) to be cleaned. I just hope the government has enough washing powder, so do not crucify me,"" Hanse remarked. In July 2012, Hanse walked the same 200 kilometre stretch against corruption at the village council, which he claimed the Local and Regional Government, Housing and Rural Development Ministry had apparently turned a blind eye to. Prompted by the latter's walk, the Local and Regional Government, Housing and Rural Development Ministry team was dispatched in August the same year to investigate the claims that centred around the controversial appointment of Connie Bock as the village council's acting chief executive officer. Hanse, who left Kalkrand at 14h30 and arrived at Rehoboth yesterday afternoon, cited the theft of money from pre-paid electricity vending machines and the controversial appointment of the current chief executive officer, Seth Boois, as the trigger for his decision to embark on the walk against corruption again. The village council, during October last year, defied Namoloh's directive not to employ Boois as the CEO. The council had ignored the results of an interview which placed Boois in fourth position and went ahead to appoint him as the CEO instead of a Mr M Kahona who was first. It made the appointment even after Namoloh had written advising them to give the job to the candidate who had scored the highest mark. The village council chairperson Christine Scholtz said they decided to engage Boois because he ""is an elderly man, a leader with previous experience as director of the football association""."496,The Daily Monitor,1/10/14,Govt has registered victory in fighting corruption,,EASTERN AFRICA (92%); UGANDA (92%); AFRICA (88%),Newspaper,Rose Namayanja Nsereko -1,ENGLISH,,,26-Jun-14,,871  words,CORRUPTION (96%); ETHICS (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (89%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (87%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (78%); FINANCIAL CRIME COUNTERMEASURES (78%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (78%); QUI TAM (76%); EDUCATION FUNDING (75%); CURRICULA (74%); MONEY LAUNDERING (73%); MISAPPROPRIATION (70%); WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION (56%); MICROFINANCE (50%),"The government of Uganda has been lauded in the East African region for leading the fight against corruption. This is because of the different anti-corruption laws so far enacted to make it difficult for public office holders to walk scot-free whenever they engage in corruption. Such laws that have been enacted include; Inspectorate of Government Act 2002; the Leadership Code Act 2002; the Anti-Corruption Act 2009; the Whistleblowers Protection Act 2010; the Access to Information Act 2005; the PPDA Act 2003 and Regulations; the National Audit Act 2008; Anti-Money Laundering Bill; Qui Tam Bill and Proceeds of Crime Bill.All the above, coupled with the different anti-corruption institutions and policies, have enabled the government to boast of positive steps in the implementation of a zero-tolerance policy towards graft. The President has thrown his full weight behind anti-corruption institutions; that is why they have been able to achieve the following successes. The government has been able to develop and implement the National Anti-Corruption Strategy 2009-2013. This is a framework designed to implement zero-tolerance to corruption. Its implementation is coordinated by the Directorate of Ethics and Integrity. Under this programme, anti-corruption institutions have been able to jointly monitor government programmes and service delivery. District Integrity forums have so far been established in 55 districts and through the same strategy, ethical values have been introduced into school curricula. This is a big achievement in as far as weeding out corruption at district level and preparing a corruption-free future generation are concerned. In the past few years, the Directorate of Public Prosecution and the Inspectorate of Government have registered a higher conviction rate in corruption cases. This is because of effective investigations and prosecutions. For instance, the practice of prosecution-led investigations has so far resulted in 100 per cent conviction rate for the 12 cases so far taken to court arising from the Global Fund, Naads and Chogm. The DPP has maintained a higher average conviction rate of more than 64 per cent at the Anti-Corruption Court compared to other criminal cases. With these convictions, the government has been able to recover billions of shillings in misappropriated public funds by way of refunds, settlements, compensation orders and fines. For instance, more than Shs4.3 billion was recovered after investigations in Global Fund, Chogm and Naads. The Anti-Corruption Court has issued compensation orders worth more than Shs32 billion against convicts. Of this money, Shs22 billion has already been realised from 41 cases that had monetary value. With such achievements, we cannot say the government is doing nothing to curb corruption. Also between 2010 and 2012, Shs16 billion was saved by the different anti-corruption departments. Moreover, further investigations are currently being conducted in several ministries and departments like Public Service, Local Government, Health, Education, Finance/Micro-Finance Support Centre, National Planning Authority, Immigration, OPM and many more. Soon the results will be made public. The government has also increased audits and widened the areas of coverage. In the same way, there is an improvement in tax revenue collection where we have been able to raise funds to foot the National Budget by more than 70 per cent. All this is because of effective enforcement of disciplinary measures for staff, which has led to a decline in corruption levels. With the government empowering anti-corruption staff with specialised skills in areas of investigation, property rights, digital investigations, cyber-crime, tracing and asset recovery, governance monitoring statistics, saving and investments in capital markets, and many others, it will be difficult for individuals to get away with corruption. This has been further reinforced with the creation of professional standards units. To avoid backlog of corruption-related cases, the DPP, IGG and the Anti-Corruption Court ensure that cases are disposed of within four months after institution by prosecutors. The court's jurisdiction has also been enhanced to include financial crimes. Meanwhile, the IGG has developed a data tracking mechanism to help detect the trends in corruption. Many other initiatives like integrity clubs in schools are being spread across the country and with the population willing to surrender more information on corruption, the vice could soon be history. This will also be possible as the government squeezes other departments to get logistical support for specialised anti-corruption officials, put in place a leadership code tribunal, hire more staff, avail more money for investigations and further decentralise the PPDA. Once again, let us show a spirit of patriotism, volunteer useful information to the CIID, IGG and DPP to ensure that we do not backtrack in the fight against corruption because it greatly affects service delivery and yet we are the ones who directly benefit from these services. 2014 should be the year for us to break the spine of the corruption monster.

The FEACC failed in the case against the seventh defendant, Hailegabriel Hika, brother of Habtamu, who was acquitted by the court."498,The Daily Monitor,1/14/14,Anti-corruption fight a bully for the weak,,UGANDA (94%); UNITED STATES (79%),Newspaper,Morris DC Komakech -1,ENGLISH,,,26-Jun-14,,831  words,CORRUPTION (96%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (89%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (73%); FORENSICS (68%),"The article by Ms Rose Namayanja Nsereko, the Minister of Information and National Guidance titled ""Government has registered victory in fighting corruption"" (Daily Monitor, January 10, 2014) must be applauded and at the same time examined critically. So far, this article is the most comprehensive insight of the progress being made by the office of the Inspector General of Government, the statutory body assigned to fight corruption. To add a more moderate voice to this rather glamorous account as depicted by the minister, Uganda is known for having some of the best laws in the region - whether laws against graft or those prohibitive laws against moral corruption, human liberties and so forth. When it comes to writing laws, Uganda has gone off its way to extract laws from Britain and from the United States without fear. Of recent, this country has been able to invoke a colonial law - that ensures preventive arrests on assumptions or prediction of potential breach. The existence of many robust anti-corruption laws in Uganda is not an issue of contestation here. The major ingredient that Uganda lacks in the fight against corruption is the political will to reinforce those laws to their rational ends. In all aspects, the problems that afflict the fight against corruption are also the transformative as well as functional nature of corruption, it being used as a political tool. Ugandans will not be deceived by romanticised statistics which glorify half a success story. While I am tempted to believe that all is rosy at the Ombudsman's office as the minister portrays, reality checks may reveal another narrative - far from what the government is numbing our nerves with. First, cases that have been easily disposed are those that affect the less important personalities who commit petty acts of corruption due to poor supervision. The government has deliberately failed to persecute those bigger political fishes whose fingers never leave public purses. And yet, the political class is the most corrupted class. This means the IGG's office and the police have never had sufficient and real powers to reign in the politicians. Second, corruption is the mediating mechanism of the regime upon which patronage and allegiances are negotiated. As a consequence, the cost of politics on public purse has become overwhelming at the expense of public service. The cost of public administration and the corruption which sustains it ensures that no public institution can claim to work independently and free of corruption. Thirdly, government's failure to prioritise funding for anti-corruption institutions and its inherent inability to accept good governance as a principled aspect of the fight against graft, illustrate their contempt for genuine anti-graft fight. Favouritism, cronyism, tribalism and the desire for life presidency, comes in handy to compromise any genuine efforts at fighting corruption. The police appear too incompetent to conduct thorough and timely forensic investigation targeting politicians, and even where they have the capacity; their efforts are often thwarted by political interferences from above. It is, therefore, justifiable to assert that any successes in the fight against corruption cannot be celebrated when the small fish are the target, leaving the influential politicians and key decision makers to be protected by the status quo. It is only logical that any victory in the fight against corruption should not be celebrated too soon; else we shall be throwing the baby out with the birth water. Corruption prevails precisely because of thriving inequities in resource distribution. The political class and the corrupted middle class have conspired to operate in the unofficial institutions which have deprived the public institution of resources and sanity. Public servants have resorted to abuse public service because it is not rewarding anymore, so they sit on their hands or abandon it all together for politics. The injustice is distressful because the political elite expropriate larger shares of national resources to themselves while they mockingly implore the public servants and peasant farmers to adhere to patriotism rather than distributive justice and equitable society. Today, we hear common slogans like ""tusaba gavumenti etuyambe"" (we beg our government to help us), which signifies the increasing gap between the government and the common people. People are increasingly distrustful of their government because of its corrupted ways. All they see as the face of this regime are wealthy politicians accumulating personal wealth, while the common man's space is dwindling and his fate consigned to providence. Like Karl Marx would say, issues of economic production have become too stressful that religion and premier league have provided the fantasy of solace for the majority of disengaged Ugandans. The anti-corruption fight is one which is perceived as bully for the weak and toothless on the most corrupt. mordust_26@yahoo.ca"499,The Namibian (Windhoek),1/16/14,"U.S. Falters, Corruption Represses Angola, Zimbabwe [analysis]",,HONG KONG (94%); CANADA (93%); ANGOLA (93%); UNITED STATES (93%); SINGAPORE (92%); ZIMBABWE (92%); NAMIBIA (79%); AFRICA (79%) Africa,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,16-Jan-14,,1508 words,CORRUPTION (90%); REGULATORY COMPLIANCE (90%); PUBLIC FINANCE (90%); TAXES & TAXATION (89%); RULE OF LAW (89%); TAX LAW (76%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (76%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (76%); DIAMOND MARKETS (73%); BUSINESS CLIMATE & CONDITIONS (73%); CORPORATE TAX (71%); TAX INCENTIVES (71%); GLOBALIZATION (70%); NEW BUSINESSES (70%) Angola; Namibia; Corruption,"THE 20th annual Index of Economic Freedom produced a world average score of 60.3 points - the highest average to date, with 43 countries, including Singapore and Sweden achieving their highest scores yet. In the 2014 Index among the 178 countries ranked, scores improved for 114 countries and declined for 59 others, while four recorded no score change. Index scores measured the rule of law, government spending and fiscal dependency, regulatory efficiencies and openness of the market. Out of 100 points, The Heritage Foundation defined ""free"" economies to have scored better than 80 points, ""mostly free"" scored between 70 points and 79.9 points, ""moderately free"" scored 60 points to 69.9 points, ""mostly unfree"" scored 50 points to 59.9 points and ""repressed"" landed scores of less than 49.9 points economic freedom. Of the major diamond-industry economies, Hong Kong scored highest of all nations at 90.1 points. Hong Kong's ""free"" economy exhibits a high degree of market openness, as measured by trade, investment and financial freedoms, according to The Heritage Foundation. It has been complemented by a transparent regulatory environment and competitive tax regime. The top corporate tax rate for Hong Kong is 16.5%, it enjoys low rates of corruption and the competitive regulatory regime aids business formation and innovation. The process for launching a business in Hong Kong is straightforward, with no minimum capital requirements, the group reported. Canada was ranked the world's sixth most economically free nation with a score of 80.2 and The Heritage Foundation defined this diamond-producing country as transparent and stable with a business climate that makes it one of the world's most attractive investment destinations. Canada exhibits openness to global trade and commerce, the financial system has remained stable, the government vigorously prosecutes corruption and its foundations of economic freedom rest on a judicial system that has an ""impeccable record of independence and transparency."" Canada's top corporate tax remains 15%, the regulatory framework for opening up a business is efficient and without any minimum capital requirements. Incorporating a business takes one procedure and less than one week. The United States slipped half a point in its ranking from one year ago to a score of 75.5 and as ""mostly free"", is the only country to have recorded a loss of economic freedom each of the past seven years. The Heritage Foundation blamed substantial expansion in the size and scope of the US government, including through new and costly regulations, increasing cronyism that has undermined the rule of law and perceptions of fairness. The US maintains a top corporate tax rate at 35%, incorporating a business takes five days on average, but the overall cost of meeting regulatory requirements has increased by over US$60 billion (N$600 billion) since 2009, with more than 130 new regulations imposed. The group stated that the full effects of ""the onerous Dodd-Frank bill"" have yet to be felt and a backlog of ongoing rule makings has prolonged business uncertainty, impeding economic growth. On the other hand, Botswana continues to be a success story on the continent of Africa, scoring 72 points in the ""mostly free"" category as its economy has been increasingly diversified, in large part due to dynamic investment attracted by low taxes, political stability and an educated workforce. Botswana continues to set an example in the management of large endowments of natural resources, the group concluded. Botswana is the least corrupt country in Africa and it maintains a top corporate tax rate of 22%. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) scored 71.4 points and The Heritage Foundation states that it could indeed ""do better in the rule of law. Respect for the rule of law remains undermined by the judicial system's lack of independence and vulnerability to political influence."" However, the UAE has no income tax and no federal-level corporate tax. Starting a business requires six procedures and takes about eight days with no minimum capital required. Licensing requirements have been streamlined and are less costly, but completing them still takes more than a month, the group found. Belgium ranked just ""moderately free"" with a score of 69.9 points. Its top corporate tax rate is 33%. Starting a business takes less than five days and costs about five percent of the level of average annual income. Bankruptcy proceedings are relatively easy. The group concluded that despite efforts to ease the rigidity of employment regulations in the past year, factors that include high sectoral minimum wages still hold back labour market flexibility. The Heritage Foundation scored Israel with 68.4 points. The nation's top corporate tax rate is at 25%, launching a business takes five procedures on average, and no minimum capital is required, but obtaining necessary permits involves about 20 procedures and takes over 200 days. The labour market needs more flexibility to accommodate rapid economic transformation and prices are generally set by market forces, but the government subsidises some political priorities such as West Bank settlement housing and green energy initiatives. Namibia scored 59.4, placing it in the ""mostly unfree"" category due to declines in the control of government spending and business freedom outweighing improvements in labour freedom, trade freedom and fiscal freedom. Official corruption remains a problem in Namibia, and investigations of major cases proceed slowly. The report concluded that public office is often given as a reward for political service and tribal affiliation is a factor. The rule of law remains weak and access to justice is obstructed by economic and geographic barriers, a shortage of public defenders and delays. Namibia's top corporate tax rate is 34% and one may start a business without minimum capital requirements, but completing licensing requirements now takes over 100 days. Institutional shortcomings continue to undermine India's chances for long-term economic development, according to the group. India scored 55.7 points as the government's presence in the economy remains extensive through state-owned enterprises and wasteful subsidy programmes that result in chronically high budget deficits. Another issue is that the overall regulatory environment remains burdened by administrative bureaucracy. India's top corporate tax rate is 32.4%, although domestic corporations pay only 30% and surcharges push the effective rates higher. Launching a business takes more than 25 days, on average, and licensing requirements cost almost 10 times the level of average annual income. The Heritage Foundation defined Angola as ""repressed"" with a score of 47.7 points, citing the lack of capable public institutions and a weak rule of law regime that together undermine the successful implementation of other critical reforms. Tariff and non-tariff barriers, coupled with burdensome investment regulations, continue to hamper development of a more dynamic private sector and interfere with diversification of the country's economic base. Corruption is widespread among government officials at all levels and investigations and/or prosecutions of government officials are practically non-existent. ""Recourse to the judicial system is discouraged by time-consuming procedures and the appearance of extensive executive influence on outcomes. Legal fees and property registration can be prohibitively expensive and the overall protection of property rights is weak,"" according to the group. Angola's top corporate tax rate is 30% and reform measures in recent years have streamlined the procedures for establishing a business, but start-ups are discouraged by pervasive corruption and very limited access to credit. Finally, and with a score of only 35.5 points, Zimbabwe was defined as ""repressed"" for an eighteenth consecutive year due to its economic instability and policy volatility. The impact from years of hyperinflation have crippled entrepreneurial activity, severely undermining realization of the country's economic potential, the group found. ""A corrupt and inefficient judicial system and general lack of transparency severely exacerbate business costs."" The Heritage Foundation cited lost diamond revenue, endemic corruption even at the highest levels of government, eroded judicial independence and continued chaos and violence for holding back economic freedom. Zimbabwe's top corporate tax rate is 25% and incorporating a business takes nine procedures and 90 days, with no minimum capital required. However, completing licensing requirements costs over 40 times the level of average annual income. The world's most-improved country on the index this year was Myanmar, which achieved a score improvement of 7.3 points, due to wider investment, business and labour freedom scores. Nonetheless, Myanmar remains a repressed economy with an overall score of 46.5. The Central African Republic's Index score declined the most worldwide, plunging 3.7 points to 46.7."500,The Herald (Harare),1/18/14,"It Takes Both Police, Public Effort to End Corruption",,ZIMBABWE (93%),Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,,18-Jan-14,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (93%)",796 words,POLICE FORCES (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); BRIBERY (89%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (89%); POLICE MISCONDUCT (78%); VEHICULAR OFFENSES (70%); DRIVING & TRAFFIC LAWS (69%) Zimbabwe; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Avondale police station has seen its second mass transfer of traffic officers and the underlying problems, and the solution found by the police, both raise several concerns. Avondale traffic operates along a swathe of the inner ring of northern suburbs, with its territory stretching as far east as the central section of Borrowdale Road and including the University of Zimbabwe, so a majority of the rich, well-educated and important residents of Harare pass through this territory each day. Such people are not afraid to complain, and often they know very senior police officers socially. While details are sketchy it is obvious that police headquarters must, to take such wholesale action, have had a large number of complaints from people who are articulate and whose word cannot be doubted. Similar behaviour by police from another station, say one in the western or southern suburbs of Harare, might not have produced the same volume of complaints, or complaints sufficiently detailed that those who command the force could take action without being unjust to some police officers. In other words, Avondale might not be worse than any other police area, it simply being more likely that bad behaviour by police in that area will result in detailed complaints. The second point of concern is that the police command has had to take moderate wholesale action. Rather than dismiss, or even have charged in court, officers proven to be guilty of corruption, the command has simply split up and transferred an entire section. Since the police have been very willing to take stringent disciplinary action against officers who breach regulations, and have even arrested and taken to court police officers caught taking bribes, it is clear that the evidence of malpractice from Avondale was not complete enough for either action. It looks like there is a list of detailed complaints but the actual corrupt officers cannot be identified. Here there could be injustice, the innocent suffering with the guilty, although even innocent officers are in breach of regulations by not reporting colleagues who are guilty, and so the mass transfer might now encourage those who are not corrupt to be more willing to report corruption, so they are not tainted with the same brush. Here it would have been better if those making complaints could have been more specific so that sterner action could be taken against those who are guilty. Of course in these situations the police have to be careful that someone who is guilty of a traffic offence, and has been properly fined, is not just trying to ""get even"" with the police officer who caught him by embellishing a tale or even lying. We appreciate the quandary that the senior command faces in this sort of situation. Finally, we must always remember that it takes two to commit an act of corruption. A bribe requires a payer and a taker. The wealthy, well-educated and powerful drivers moving through the Avondale police area are ideally placed to take a lead in ending corruption. They cannot be taken in by empty threats, so for them a bribe is simply a convenience rather than extortion, a way of minimising the delay after being caught. Sometimes the bribe is almost accidental, a driver asking if he has to wait for the ticket or can he just pay the fine and go. The drivers should wait, and the police should make them wait. If drivers were willing to insist on getting the ticket and paying the legal fine, even though that process takes five minutes, they would minimise corruption. They would also accumulate evidence of harassment. Those who regularly travel through the Avondale police area, and have fallen foul of the traffic section there report that police were exceptionally heavy handed. There are the things that everyone knows they should not do: speeding, treating a stop sign or red light as a give-way sign, and refusing to display licence discs. Everyone knows that you are fined if caught doing this sort of thing. But Avondale traffic went further than most stations in fining people for debatable offences, such as whether a person turning right did or did not cut the extreme edge of a corner by around 5cm, the sort of things that are difficult to prove or disprove. A fanatical determination to enforce seat belt wearing, and even questioning people without a municipal water supply for a week why their cars were dirty, did not help inspire respect. But paying these US$5 fines for trivial offences, and then complaining, might warn police commanders that there is something odd happening. We believe that the police are genuine in their determination to end corruption. But we think the next steps must involve the public refusing to offer bribes and being willing to complain about possible harassment as well as corruption."
