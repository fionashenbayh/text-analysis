Under the African nation's proposals, according to conference participants, an official from the International Monetary Fund would take a key role in managing Zaire's central bank and another foreign official would supervise all outlays by the Finance Ministry. The plan was presented at the start of a two-day meeting between Zairian officals and representatives of 10 creditor nations and three international bodies.  Together, they exercise a crucial influence on the survival of President Mobutu Sese Seko's government. While the meeting was scheduled before the invasion by Katangan rebels a month ago, the overriding issue was whether Mobutu's government, and Western investments in the huge country, can be protected time and again from determined attackers - who President Carter has maintained are Cuban-trained. The creditor nations show little sympathy for Mobutu yet seem to be forced to save him to keep Zaire in the Western camp and capable of paying its debts. This mood of political frustration lends an air of unreality to the meeting, which is supposed to concentrate solely is financial issues affecting the potentially rich mineral-exporting nation. Lack of discipline in Zaire's central bank and inefficiency and corruption within the government have been major factors for the past few years in Western reluctance to extend still more credit and aid to a country whose debt is already said to total about $2.5 billion. The so-called ""Mobutu plan,"" and Zaire's economic woes, both go back some two years and are due in part to the sharp decline in world copper prices.  Copper provides about 70 percent of Zaire's export revenues, with cobalt the second major mineral export. The situation neared the brink of economic catastrophe following the invasion of mineral-rich Shaba province the secessionist rebels based in Angola.  The attack, although eventually driven off by French paratroopers, has shut down the mines for at least six months and driven away or left dead many of the Europeans who operate the mines . The meeting here is not designed to make decision on what to do about the economic plight but rather to hear the revised Zaire plan and achieve some sort of consensus about what can be recommended to the governments of the United States, Britian Belgium, France, West Germany, the Netherlands, Italy. Japan, Canada and Iran, as well as IMF, World Bank, and the executive committee of the European Common Market. The officials meeting here are trying to agree on recommendations for an initial $100 million to $120 million emergency aid program of food, medicine and humanitarian supplies over the next three months that was agreed in principle at a five-power meeting in Paris earlier this month. The Mobutu plan, however, could eventually cost a few billion dollars. Although the plan was not made public, Belgian officials said their fomer colony indicated its long-term investment needs through 1980 amount to about $1 billion.  Whether this would come from governmental or private sectors is now being discussed. Zaire, according to Belgian officials, already has unmet debt repayments projected at 2.2 billion between 1977 and 1980.  Some 40 percent of this is owned to private creditors. In addition to the investment program additional aid would be needed from international organizations. The key factor in whether the plan gains widespread supporty, however, is said to hinge upon the IMF granting new credits to Zaire.  In 1976-77 the IMF granted special standby credits totaling some $273 million. The Mobutu plan is said to propose major efforts to get the shattered mining industry back into production, attract foreign investors, revamp the public service, improve customs and import licensing services and democratize the country. Zaire has always had many Europeans in key advisory posts - especially Belgians, who have some $6 billion in vested there.  But the new plan envisions bringing in many others. The arrival of these foreign experts, Zairian delegate Bokana W'Ondangela said, ""doesn't mean we are coming back to colonialism - but simply into international cooperation.  We are turning to our friends and to international organizations for assistantce."""1-Jan-80,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (95%); RWANDA (93%); BURUNDI (92%); FRANCE (91%); UNITED STATES (79%); GERMANY (79%); ZAMBIA (79%); ANGOLA (79%); JAPAN (79%); BELGIUM (77%);","Around the northeastern Zairian town of Bukavu, a fertile highland area on the Rwanda-Burundi border, food crops are rotting in the fields because avaiation fuel is not available to fly it to other parts of the country. Because what remain of the thousands of miles of roads in Zaire at independence in 1960 are now mostly washed-out gulleys, ""trucks can't bring it out, either,"" the Zairian said. ""Farmers in that region smuggle coffee into Rwanda in exchange for gasoline,"" he said.  ""Each region does its own thing to survive."" Smugglers bring food into Lubumbashi from Zambia, Zaire's equally hard pressed southern neighbor.  In three years, the price of bread here has jumped from 25 cents a loaf to $1.50. Government corruption, exorbitant borrowing and mismanagement all have contributed to turning Zaire from prosperity a short five years ago into what is now considered among the world's worst economic ""basket cases."" Added to these ills was 1974's sharp drop in the price of copper -- Zaire's main foreign exchange earner -- from $1.40 to 60 cents a pound. Almost insolvent by 1976, Zaire ended up $5 billion in debt.  Today, Zaire must pay for nearly all its imports in foreign exchange prior to to delivery.  Few companies are willing to extend credit to the country. ""Fifty percent of this mess can be laid directly on the Zairians,"" said one Western source.  ""But I also blame the West for pouring loans in here when Zaire was doing well."" One-fifth, or $1 billion, of Zaire's debt is owed to international commercial banks who envisioned healthy returns on their loans when times were good.  The rest is owed to other governments and their agencies in the West. Anxious to keep the vital copper and cobalt mines in southern Shaba Province running, and to support the authoritarian but friendly government of President Mobutu Sese Seko against Communist inroads that have taken over neighboring governments in Angola and the Republic of the Congo, the West has found itself in the position of continuing to fund his corrupt regime and Zaire's downhill slide. Last November, the principal Western nations that aid Zaire -- including the United States, Belgium, France, West Germany, Britain and Japan -- met in Brussels and agreed to lend the country an additional $200 million in 1980.  In December, Zaire's creditors -- a group comprised primarily of the same nations -- pledged in Paris to reschedule hundreds of millions of dollars in debt over the next several years. A debate is raging in the international economic community on whether to ""turn off the spigot"" to Zaire, said a World Bank official here.  But so far creditors, despite Zaire' current $1.1 billion debt arrears, have put their confidence in the International Fund, which has attempted to take control of the administration of Zaire's economy. Mobutu ""realizes he must follow the IMF stabilization plan,"" one financial expert said, ""and allow their team to run the economy, or they pull out.  He doesn't have much breathing space."" As part of his agreement to the fund's plan in 1978, Mobutu had to accept a team of IMF-selected Western economic experts, headed by West German banker Erwin Blumenthal, to run the national bank.  ""A major part of that was to halt those who were dining at the trough,"" one expert said. Other international experts have ben brought in to run sections of the Ministry of Finance. The Fund's intercession came too late to stop Zaire's purchase of a now-deteriorating $18 million radio-television complex from France, or the recently opened $34 million People's Palace conference center from China. ""Zaire didn't need either one,"" a Western source said. Twenty-four percent of Zaire's public debt is tied to the construction of the economically wasteful 1,100-mile Inga-Shaba power line project.  When completed in 1983, the line will carry hydroelectric power from Zaire's coast down to Shaba for the copper industry. ""They just listened to incredibly bad advice on that project,"" said one informed source.  ""It'll be years before it pays for itself."" Almost immediately upon his arrival in August, 1978.  Blumenthal attacked the country's pervasive corruption at official levels, extending his reach to Mobutu's family and political entourage.  As principal director of Zaire's central bank, Blumenthal cut off all credit and foreign exchange to Mobutu's powerful and wealthy uncle, Litho Moboti, Fifty Zairian companies, owned by Mobutu's closest associates, were banned from doing any business with the bank until they paid long overdue loans previously ignored with impunity.  Most have paid up. Blumenthal and his team also put stringent controls on how foreign exchange earned from Zaire's copper and cobalt exports, the source of 70 percent of the country's revenue, would be distributed. Thirty percent of export earnings were kept by the bank to begin paving off the country's debst, two-thirds spent on food, medicines, spare parts and raw material imports for local industry, 2 percent on gasoline, and 5 percent on nonpriority items. Blumenthal also had to face down at least one Army general whose subordinates threatened him with physical harm unless the general was given some foreign exchange, according to a Western source: ""The general didn't get one penny, and he was later dismissed from the army. Blumenthal left in a huff last July, after completing 11 months of a year-long IMF contract, following a conflict with the Central Bank's Zairian governor, Emony Mondanga. ""Blumenthal was not a man to compromise,"" said a source who knows both men, ""and Emony does not suffer his power to be diluted.  Blumenthal said he was going to Germany for a vaction, and unles Emony was removed, he would not return."" Neither Mobutu nor the IMF backed Blumenthal's demand, another source said: ""He won many fights and lost some, including that one."" The Fund has since replaced Blumenthal with Mauritanian economist Mamadou Toure, who arrived in mid-October.  A full IMF investigation team will come during the last two weeks in January to check Zaire's compliance with Fund guidelines. When you ask 'whither Zaire?'"" said a U.S.-educated Zairian intellectual, ""you should be asking 'whither Mobutu?' As long as the West supports Mobutu,"" he continued bitterly, ""then this pit I call home will continue to go down."" In a country where an estimated 40 percent of government funds goes into the pockets of government officials, Mobutu has climbed the acquisition ladder from a salaried Army lieutenant general to become one of the world's wealthiest men. ""We're not talking about peanuts,"" said one expert on Zaire's trouble finances, ""We're talking about Mobutu's people using the Country's bank as their personal piggy bank to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars."" A Western official cited a study by Prof. Crawford Young of the University of Wisconsin that indicate irregular financial transactions involving coffee exports.  In 1977, Zaire exported about $540 million worth of coffee but only about $160 million were registered by Zaire's central bank. ""Clearly some funds go into foreign accounts,"" an American official said. Mobutu and his family control Celsa, a major coffee conglomerate in Zaire. The official also described as ""murky"" Zaire's diamond exports.  They are also controlled by the president. Despite IMF intervention, many here believe Zaire will never regain economic health as long as Mobutu remains in power. Direct rake-offs of government funds by Mobutu and his poltical cronies are reflected all the way down the line of authority to rank-and-file soldiers in the Zaire Army, many of whom extort civilians as a matter of practice.  But the Army, too, has its troubles.  Officers traditionally pocket the pay of their soldiers, and sell their good on the thriving black market. Smuggling, for those outside of Mobutu's family and personal patronage circle, is a hazardous endeavor, but many risk life and limb, ""sometimes just to get enough to eat,"" said one informed source. This year, Zaire will lose an estimated $40 million in coffee revenues and $60 million in diamond revenues to smugglers. In an effort to break out of a cycle of deepening poverty, Zaire's financial planners have put together a $1.8 billion economic reform and development proposal, characteristically called ""The Mobutu Plan,"" that they hope will be financed by the West over a three-year period. Kiakwama Kia Kiziki, the country's minister of economy, industry and commerce, argues that the plan is the only thing that can turn Zaire's economy around. But one informed source, waving copies of the foot-thick proposal, said the plan has no priorites, the financing is unrealistic, and Zaire ""can't absorb that amount of money over three years."" The West is ""not about to bail Zaire out"" with the plan, said one Western source familiar with the proposal. But Kiakwama, speaking in his plush, wood-panelled office, ended an interview on a note that has in the past brought last-minute help to Zaire. ""If there is no peace in Zaire,"" he said, ""there is no peace in Africa.  The West must help us now."" Most observers believe Zaire' principal hope for turning the economic tide that has flowed so strongly against it in recent years are its mineral reserves. Prices for both copper and cobalt have risen since 1976, with copper presently up to 90 cents a pound, and cobalt at $25 a ton to regular purchasers like the United States and $32 a ton on the mineral spot market. Cobalt prices, which were only $6 a ton a year ago, are in fact so high that transportation and gasoline-short Zaire has been flying the mineral out of Shaba instead of using its cheaper and only availabl rail route through South Africa. The increase in earnings has gradually pulled Zaire's growth rate from a minus 6 percent to about minus 1 percent today.  But the real possibility of a recession in the industrial West and Japan could set the country on an economic backslide. ""Any drop in demand or drop on [mineral] prices would hurt us,"" acknowledged Economy Minister Kiakwama. ""If prices remain as they are today, we think we can get out of negative growth by 1981.  If there is a recession in the United States and Europe -- remember our economy is based on what happens there -- then we will suffer,"" Kiakwama said. According to one Western source, ""If the mines at Kolwezi keep producing, if the world market is stable for a couple of years, and if there are no upheavals (in Shaba) like last year, then Zaire has a chance in the long run. ""I know,"" the source said.  ""Those are a lot of ifs."""31-May-80,UGANDA (99%); UNITED STATES (94%); KENYA (92%);,"Two Ugandans employed by the U.S. private aid agency CARE have been killed by Ugandan soldiers, the U.S. Embassy in Kampala, Uganda, said today. The killings, reminiscent of countless murders carried out by Gen. Idi Admin's dictatorship, which was overthrown last year, came just two weeks after a military coup ousted the civilian Ugandan government headed by Godfrey Binaisa. Western nations have been uneasy for months about the security of their aid missions in Uganda.  The two Ugandans' deaths at the hands of the military could lead the Western countries to curtail assistance programs that are badly needed by Uganda.  The country has been devastated by eight years of Amin's bloody rule, a six-month war to overthrow him and ensuing chaos and corruption. U.S. Charge David Halsted said in a telephone interview from Kampala that he took up the matter with the Ugandan Foreign Ministry yesterday after the two bodies were found with bullet holes in their backs. They were discovered in the Namanve Forest outside Kampala, a favorite dumping ground for bodies used by Amin's notorious State Research Bureau, which was responsible for numerous killings.  Estimates of those killed under Amin range as high as half a million. Halsted said a Foreign Ministry official expressed shock at the killings and said the government would investigate.  There has been no official Ugandan statement. The two men, Walter Wakudsune and Christopher Musoke, both in their late 20's, were employees of CARE, an American-based private agency specializing in Third World development aid.  Wakudsune and Musoke were supervisors of a school rehabilitation project outside Kampala being carried out by CARE.  The project was partially funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development. Witnesses said Ugandan soldiers stopped the two men while they were riding in a CARE vehicle Tuesday and took them away in the direction of a military barracks, according to U.S. AID Director Chuck Grader, who later identified the bodies. The next day, soldiers were seen driving the CARE vehicle on the streets of Kampala. When Grader questioned the military, he was told that there had been only one person stopped, a military deserter, and that he had escaped.  Halsted said this was impossible since the two men had worked for CARE since last June, long before the reconstituted Ugandan Army was formed. ""It will be important to see how the government of Uganda deals with these murders and brings to justice those responsible,"" Halsted said, an indication that Western patience with the security situation was wearing thin. i The deaths were the first of persons involved with U.S. assistance projects in the country.  Earlier this month, however, a Ugandan driver for the International Communications Agency was killed by unknown assailants. The United Nations temporarily pulled all its personnel out of Uganda last August after a British U.N. official and a Ugandan driver were killed. Problems with the military go back to the Amin days when soldiers were given free reign to commit acts of violence.  Most of The 40,000-man Tanzanian Army, which led the fight to overthrow Amin, was not paid and learned to live off the land in Uganda.  The fledging 5,000-man Ugandan military has often followed the same pattern since its formation late last year. A priest was killed earlier this month in the drought-stricken northern area, although most likely by bandits. The violence has not spared even officials of the new government.  A former ambassador was roughed up and robbed at gunpoint by soldiers in the lobby of Kampala's leading hotel two days after the May 19 coup. U.S. AID's Grader and Francesco Strippoli, deputy director of the U.S. World Food Program, were held for three hours by Ugandan troops last week during a tour of the drought area. Uganda has complained that little Western aid has been delivered since Amin was toppled last year.  About $300 million in aid is projected, mainly from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and The European Economic Community. The United States has programmed about $6 million. Beside the security situation, AID officials complain of lack of coordination by the government, serious currency problems, which have spawned a huge black market and corruption, which makes it difficult to guarantee that aid commodities will get to the intended beneficiaries. ""From a development point of view, development must start with the host,"" one official said. Another diplomat said there have been thieves and outlaws before, ""but it's another thing when the source of insecurity is the country's own army."" There are eight U.S. embassy and AID personnel in Uganda and about 150 private American citizens."19-Jul-81,UGANDA (98%); UNITED STATES (79%); AFRICA (79%);,"A train hit a truck at a railroad crossing near Kampala the other day and people were hurt. To some careful observers of Uganda's affairs, it was cause for a small celebration - not the accident, but the fact that a train had been operating. ''Two years ago, there were no trains at all,'' one analyst said. ''It's not much, but it's something.'' Only in Uganda, perhaps, could optimism be woven from such frail thread. The assessment came from a foreigner. Ugandans seem less willing to build dreams on the cold reality of economic deprivation, political and tribal division and fragile security. ''You cannot find a single Ugandan who will live an honest life and make ends meet if they depend solely on their wages,'' said Paul Ssemogerere, leader of the opposition Democratic Party. ''The only way people survive is to get a second job. The other way is to engage in corrupt practices, selling their signature, bribery, demanding money for services that should otherwise be free. Corruption becomes a big temptation.'' The temptation can be very big, indeed. Coffee, for instance, the source of 97 percent of Uganda's foreign exchange earnings, has become a target for manipulation. The head of the Coffee Marketing Board, through which all coffee sales officially go, is the army chief of staff. Magendo, or the black market, thrives. The Fruits of Neglect Western economists take heart, however, from President Milton Obote's budget, announced last month, which they praise as a bold free market document, virtually unique in Africa. He has set the Ugandan shilling free to float and removed official price restraints. The spread between black market and official rates of exchange for the United States dollar has narrowed sharply, from 10 times the official price to a mere four times the new official rate.  The budget was Uganda's side of a bargain with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. They provided $197 million for essential imports, to help beat the black market and revive sectors that collapsed during eight years of former President Idi Amin's mismanagement. For example, under General Amin, no one looked at the Kampala water supply; now there is a typhoid outbreak. The main hospital for typhoid patients has had no direct water supply for five years. ''Now we've got the pumps working again,'' an engineer said.  ''The problem is that we don't think the pipes will take the pressure.'' General Amin is also blamed for the virtual collapse of wholesale-retail trade, once directed by tens of thousands of Asians whom he expelled after seizing power from Mr. Obote in 1971. But the new budget has had little immediate effect for most Ugandans. Many earn less than $25 a month (at the new exchange rate), while a family's basic monthly food bill is twice that amount and the inflation rate is 100 percent. ''The impact of the budget will only be felt when the pipeline of goods bought with aid money starts flowing. That could take some time,'' a Western economist said. ''Some things have already improved,'' he added. ''You can get sugar now, and it's cheaper than before. If favoritism in allocating import licences and corrupt handling of foreign exchange is stopped, then the budget has a good chance.'' Some analysts, however, do not believe favoritism and corruption will be easily eradicated. Unless there are economic benefits for the 12 million people, they warn, there will be no basis for reducing tribal and political hatreds or for undercutting popular support for the many guerrilla groups opposing Mr. Obote or, eventually, for restoring discipline to the army. The army is said to number 8,000 to 10,000 men - reportedly, no one at headquarters knows the total - underpaid and disorderly, largely from the Lango and Acholi people of the northeast, Mr.  Obote's home area. They do not get on with the 3.5 million Baganda people, the biggest tribe, who live in the south. ''Uganda cannot work without our cooperation,'' said a leading Baganda tribe member, who asked not to be identified. ''That cooperation will not be forthcoming unless we see an end to northerners enriching themselves at our expense and until the army stops robbing and killing.  Bagandans are not violent people, but they are being forced to side with the guerrillas.'' Mr. Obote returned to power in December in elections that opposition spokesmen have charged were rigged. His people had been brutalized by Mr. Amin's regime and now his army is exacting reprisals. Last month, soldiers gunned down more than 50 unarmed civilians at Ombachi mission in West Nile province, where Mr. Amin recruited soldiers, including his own Kakwa people. Opposition leaders have accused the Obote regime of ''systematic violation of human rights'' - arbitrary arrest, detention without trial and killing of opponents. But Mr. Obote's supporters blame disorder on ''bad elements'' left from previous regimes. They point out that the opposition operates freely in Parliament and can sell its newspapers. Since General Amin's ouster by Tanzanian troops and a small force of Ugandan exiles in April 1979, Ugandans have had two civilian governments, a military regime and, now, Mr. Obote. In the turmoil, they somehow display resilience. On a recent Sunday at a busy Kampala intersection where potholes had taken over the road, a jeepload of soldiers with a machine gun were busy ''raiding'' the area for suspected guerrillas. Nearby, policemen at one of Uganda's ubiquitous roadblocks held up cars. Sunday, however, is a time for relaxation and in sight of both police and army, a group of Ugandans took to the field of a dilapidated sports club, playing cricket in the warm sunlight."14-Mar-82,CAMEROON (99%); AFRICA (94%); NIGERIA (79%); GABON (79%);,"The President is building himself a new palace here, breaking a 20-year tradition of aversion to the kind of prestige projects that are part of Africa's landscape, and there are other signs of change. The inflation rate, for instance, is nudging upward, and so is military spending; increasingly, young people are heading for the cities, away from the farms that form the spine of an economy known as one of Africa's success stories; roads are being built so that downtown Yaounde looks like one big, mud-colored construction site; corruption and crime are reportedly on the increase. The driving force behind the slow transformation is oil, despite a determined campaign by President Ahmadou Ahidjo to minimize its impact, and despite official secrecy about the value of Cameroon's newly found offshore fields. Last year, according to a Western diplomatic source, oil brought in about $200 million for the Government, but none of it showed up overtly in the national budget or in the latest development plan. At present, the diplomat said, production is running at around 95,000 barrels a day. With more wells coming into use, Cameroon's oil output, which virtually covers domestic needs now, should quadruple by the end of 1982. The figures are all approximations because the authorities do not, Western diplomats say, reveal definite statistics. Triple-A Credit Rating The characteristic reticence is a result of the President's desire to insure that Cameroon does not, like its neighbors Gabon and Nigeria, become intoxicated with the giddy wealth of petrodollars and suffer the agricultural neglect and mushrooming urban growth that have afflicted other African oil producers. ''Cameroon already had a triple-A credit rating before oil was found,'' a Western banker said. ''It feeds itself. The President has made it clear time and again that agriculture will remain the base of the economy, not oil. The oil money started coming in at a time of low commodity prices, so it was a windfall, but the Cameroonians do not want agriculture to be overtaken.'' Cameroon's success as an agricultural producer is attributed by many analysts to an official policy of maintaining high prices for farmers' produce and avoiding the bias toward urban consumers that the World Bank in particular sees as a critical flaw in many African economies. Agriculture earns half of the country's export revenues and employs 70 percent of the active labor force. Food, cocoa, coffee and timber are exported. The result is what seems to be a booming economy. In the markets surrounding main cities like Yaounde, the seat of Government, and Douala, the commercial capital, pineapples, vegetables, yams, clothes, perfumes and cooked delicacies are on display in profusion. Signs of Strain Yet there are signs of strain associated with oil. ''The petroleum money goes to the fat-cats at the top - we don't see any benefit from it,'' said a man called Jean-Marie Alus, who lives in one of Douala's sprawling shanties. ''What we see is our cousins and brothers coming to town to get jobs because they've heard about the oil. We are Africans and we have African hospitality so we cannot turn them away. But then they don't find jobs and it's a strain on us to pay for them.'' According to one Western estimate, only 200,000 of Douala's 700,000 residents live in comfort. Of Cameroon's eight million people, about 25 percent live in the cities and towns but in the next 20 years this proportion could double. A further oil-associated problem is, according to Western diplomats, corruption. ''There's a lot of oil money to be skimmed off,'' one Westerner said, ''and the President doesn't allow people to stay in powerful jobs for too long, so the temptation is to make hay while the sun shines.'' ''In Cameroon,'' said one of Yaounde's ubiquitous airport expediters - men who ''arrange'' seats on airplanes when the passenger list shows there are none - ''you do not go in a straight line to get to your goal, you go like this.'' The expediter made a snake-like gesture with one hand, took a would-be passenger's offering with the other and disappeared behind the airline counter.  He returned, a short while later, with a confirmed ticket for what was supposedly a fully-booked airplane. 'A Benevolent Dictator' Mr. Ahidjo, described by one Western diplomat as ''a benevolent dictator,'' presides over the country with a Government that keeps real power within the closed circle of his senior advisers and uses ministries as a means of balancing Cameroon's competing ethnic and religious groups. It is a style of rule that has won Western plaudits for bringing stability to a nation that achieved independence in 1960. It had been divided into French and British mandates. ''Ahidjo has run a pretty tight Government, he hasn't gone in for profligate spending and he's won for his country a reputation for economic growth and political stability,'' said a Western diplomat.  ''If he wants to build himself a new palace now, why shouldn't he?  Maybe he feels that it's time Cameroon had some kind of edifice commensurate with its economic power.'' The object of the conversation was the soaring palace that is being built atop one of the foliage-clad hills on which Yaounde stands, across the city from an equally imposing, Chinese-built ''people's palace'' that dominates another hillside. But a Cameroonian resident, requesting anonymity, said: ''The palace will cause resentments. It is being built with oil money that is not going to the people.''"17-Jun-83,GHANA (94%); BURKINA FASO (94%); LIBYAN ARAB JAMAHIRIYA (94%); AFRICA (93%); KENYA (92%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%); LIBERIA (92%); GAMBIA (92%);   LIBYA (94%);,"In the face of overwhelming numbers, a small band of mutinous soldiers for the past month has occupied a small town near the Ghanaian border and ignored demands to lay down their Libyan-supplied arms. The impasse at the town of Po grew out of an ineptly executed pre-dawn purge by Upper Volta's conservative, pro-western senior Army officers against a group of radical, avowedly pro-Libyan junior officers. The tense standoff appears to be typical of Upper Volta, a West African country that prides itself on a record of three relatively bloodless military coups in 23 years of independence. Events in Upper Volta show how fragile African governments are when beset by ideological divisions and how easily an outside power, in this case Libya, can manipulate such internal conflicts. Moreover, the deadlock here reflects the generational differences afflicting the armed forces in many African countries, a fracture that contributed to uprisings in Ghana, Liberia, Gambia and Kenya. In each case, junior officers sought to justify their revolt as the overthrowing of an older generation of entrenched, corrupt politicians and senior army officers. Since 1979, junior officers have succeeded twice in Ghana and took power in 1980 in Liberia, but were crushed severely in Gambia in 1981 and last August in Kenya. Domestic tension in each of the countries had been exacerbated by recession-battered economies before the upheavals, a circumstance that continues for most of black Africa today. A landlocked West African country in the continent's semiarid Sahel belt, Upper Volta is listed by the world bank as one of the world's 15 poorest countries, with an annual per capita income of $210. Even before the global recession, the six-year Sahel drought that ended in 1974 had set back Upper Volta's meager economic growth by a decade, according to a western economist. The country's Army came to power when the first independent civilian government fell in 1966 after a popular uprising and general strike. The uprising and strike were in protest against official corruption, readily noticeable amid the stark poverty here, and of increasing political restrictions. Since then, Upper Volta's senior Army officers and ""old guard"" politicians have dragged their 7.1 million compatriots through seven unstable governments while ineffectually grappling with the country's worsening economic problems. The latest military government to emerge has its roots in an uneasy alliance between senior officers trained in the French colonial army and a small leftist group among the generally better educated junior officers who banded last November in a palace coup that overthrew Col. Saye Zerbo's discredited two-year-old military regime. After forming an all-military, 120-member People's Salvation Council Assembly, they made the typical declaration that they took power to rectify the Zerbo regime's ""corruption, irresponsibility and denial of fundamental rights."" They also promised to establish a movement toward economic development, ""true"" democracy and political stability. A mild-mannered Army medical doctor, Maj. Jean-Baptiste Ouedraogo, 42, was selected as head of state to represent the conservatives while a firebrand, charismatic leftist, Capt. Thomas Sankara, 33, was appointed as his prime minister to satisfy the coterie of radical junior officers. Beginning in February, Sankara made his conservative Army colleagues nervous when his 48-hour scheduled stopover in Tripoli to see the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar Qaddafi, was prolonged to a week. The Salvation Council's promised stability began to unravel when Sankara's men ferreted out a since-questioned March countercoup plot among conservative Army and civilian leaders, about 15 of whom were arrested. In virulent speeches denouncing ""internal enemies of the people"" such as traders, all religious leaders and ""bourgeois"" trade unionists, Sankara began to amass a popular following among Upper Volta's students and urban poor, while simultaneously alienating several levels of the general conservative Upper Voltan society, according to a well-informed Upper Voltan journalist. The split came when Sankara invited Qaddafi to Ouagadougou for an official visit at the end of April, then notified the head of state of the visit fewer than 24 hours before the Libyan leader's arrival, Ouedraogo has said publicly. Sankara already had praised Qaddafi's style of ""people's revolution"" in speeches, and after the April 30 visit, about 10 planeloads of Libyan arms were delivered to Ouagadougou's airport after dark, western diplomatic and informed Upper Voltan sources said. ""Some of the arms made it down to Po to Sankara's Army commando supporters,"" added an informed western diplomatic source. Po is 87 miles south of Ouagadougou near the border with Ghana. Two weeks later, the behind-the-scenes conservative strongman, Col. Yorian Gabriel Some, ordered a predawn roundup and arrest of the leftist junior officers. Troops missed radical Capt. Blaise Compaore, however. He escaped to Po and has since led the group of about 150 Army commandos loyal to Sankara in revolt against the country's 3,700-man Army. Head of state Ouedraogo afterward dissolved the Salvation Council as a failure and ordered all troops back to their barracks. He appointed a 19-member, mainly civilian Cabinet, announced that a new constitution would be prepared within six months and that he would hand the government over to an elected civilian governemnt by November 1984. In an effort to reconcile all of Upper Volta's disgruntled factions, on May 27 Ouedraogo ordered all military and civilian political prisoners released. This included Sankara and his radical colleagues. Sankara, however, was kept under house arrest but two weeks later was returned to barracks detention after allegedely trying to escape over the back wall of his house. Throughout, the commandos at Po--half of whom are barely trained recruits--have remained in revolt. The rebels demand the unconditional release of Sankara, his reintegration into his commando unit and the reestablishment of the dissolved Salvation Council. In a June 14 interview in his office, Ouedraogo denied that large, 1 a.m. troop movements--after the nation's curfew--south from Ouagadougou toward Po were a signal that he finally had run out of patience and was preparing to attack the rebels. ""We are still on the way to resolve this matter in the most pacific manner possible and without a violent confrontation,"" Ouedraogo said. Ouedraogo added that additional Libyan arms have crossed northern Ghana and were delivered to the mutinous troops at Po. Ghana's military ruler, Flight Lt. Jerry J. Rawlings, has developed close ties with Qaddafi since his second coup at the end of 1981. Libya is trying to exploit the Upper Voltans' differences among themselves to get the radicals into power, he said. Ouedraogo said he did not know whether Qaddafi has Upper Volta earmarked as part of his envisioned revolutionary Libyan-led pan-African federation, but added that it is clear that ""Qaddafi is trying to destabilize Upper Volta, and that is why he is sending arms here."""30-Jun-83,MALAWI (99%); CENTRAL AFRICA (94%); AFRICA (93%); RUSSIAN FEDERATION (92%); CHINA (79%);,"The citizens of this landlocked Central African country voted today in a parliamentary election that will probably cause little change in either their lives or in the way this country has been governed for the last 19 years. About two million of Malawi's six million people are believed to have registered to vote for candidates bidding for the 101 elected seats in Parliament. As they have little final say over who the candidates are or what they stand for, the true test of sentiment will be the level of abstentions, reflecting apathy or protest. Malawi is a one-party state run by a Life President, Dr. Hastings Kamuzu Banda, who has led the nation since its independence from Britain in 1964. He has done so in a manner described by friends as paternalistic and by enemies as harshly dictatorial, controlling both the political and the economic life of the country. Apart from the presidency, he also heads the Ministries of Agriculture, Justice, Information, Tourism, Works, Foreign Affairs and Defense. An Untypical African Nation It has been an idiosyncratic period of one-man rule. Malawi is the only African country to recognize South Africa, its political opposition has been dealt with summarily and the nation has acquired a reputation as an African odd man out, isolated from the mainstream of the continent's politics. But despite crushing poverty and severely limited resources, Malawi is also one of the few African nations able to feed itself, and Western aid donors rate its use of foreign assistance highly. Mistrustful of Communist nations, Malawi does not have relations with China or the Soviet Union. President Banda is said to view the Russians as ''uncivilized'' because, he reportedly told visitors recently, Russia was never colonized by the Romans. He is a great respecter of ancient Rome and Greece. The conduct of the elections illustrates his political style.  Candidates, all of whom are members of the Malawi Congress Party, are theoretically chosen by the people who will vote for them, but President Banda - the self-titled Ngwazi, or Conquering Hero, of the nation - has the power of veto over the list of candidates presented to him before the vote. Qualifications Specified The official electoral rules say candidates should include ''persons who have never been expelled or suspended from the party; persons who are not subversive; persons who are of sound mind.'' They must all pass an English literacy test before being approved. The candidates in Malawian elections do not campaign or speak to their potential constituents. ''People are not allowed to canvass for candidature,'' the rules state. ''If canvassing is allowed, people who aspire to go to Parliament will be tempted to bribe and corrupt the people in the district. Bribery and corruption would enable people who are rich and crooks to go to Parliament.'' Thus, the candidates are presented to the voters at official meetings and the electorate makes its choice on the basis of this encounter. Parliament itself, Malawian officials acknowledge, is subservient to the party. As electoral systems go, it makes for a tranquil vote. There are no loudspeaker vans exhorting the populace to choose one candidate or another, no placards or posters depicting the aspirants, no tubthumping rallies, no ferment. The only public portrait on show is that of the Life President, currently on wide display in anticipation of celebrations on July 6. That was the day, 25 years ago, that Dr. Banda returned from his medical practice in Ghana to lead the struggle against colonialism. Fetes Are Spectacular It was also the day, six years later, that Britain's Union Jack was furled for the last time and independence was declared.  In preparation for the anniversaries, most city buildings are bedecked in green, black and red - the party colors - and women in particular are preparing for one of Dr. Banda's public appearances.  These are widely regarded as spectacular. President Banda will arrived at his stadium in an open Land-Rover, wearing his traditional outfit - a dark three-piece suit, a homburg hat and dark glasses - and carrying a fly wisk, his personal totem. Women will dance for him, dressed in brightly colored cloths printed with his portrait. At intervals, Dr. Banda will descend from the podium to join the dance, engulfed in a sea of ululating dancers so that only the fly wisk, held aloft, is visible. Then he will return to the podium. Speculation Forbidden The Life President's age is unclear. Officially it is put at about 77. Other estimates put it in the mid-80's, but speculation about the matter is forbidden here, as is public discussion about who will succeed him. Visitors who have seen him recently say he shows no sign of intending to relinquish power and no indication of weakened faculties, but his control of the nation has not been without challenge. Dr. Banda's career began when, according to his official biography, he walked 1,000 miles to South Africa to seek education and work.  Later, he went to the United States and was educated in subjects including medicine in Massachusetts, Ohio and Indiana. He qualified as a doctor in Edinburgh, Scotland, and did not return to his country for almost 40 years, until 1958, when the nation was called Nyasaland and was part of the British-run federation that also consisted of present-day Zambia and Zimbabwe. Among the many initials and titles that follow his name is the Order of D.O.F., meaning Destroyer of the Federation, a title bestowed by Zambia in 1975 in recognition of his opposition to British colonialism. Dr. Banda was detained for a year by the British for his activism in 1959. White Officials Retained Almost immediately after independence, a first challenge arose when six ministers opposed Dr. Banda's insistence on the retention of whites to help run the country. The six lost the battle after a 48-hour sitting of Parliament and fled into exile. One of them, former Justice Minister Orton Chirwa, and his wife, Vera, are currently under sentence of death here, having been lured back into the country two years ago and charged with treason under a legal system framed by Mr. Chirwa himself. The former minister led one of several largely ineffective exiled Malawian opposition groups. Another exile, Atati Mpakati, was assassinated in Zimbabwe last March. Three Government ministers and one member of Parliament died last month in a mysterious car accident that many people believe was a political killing. Over the years, several thousand people have been imprisoned for political offenses. The number of such detainees now is put by foreigners at 40 to 50. Big Foreign Debt Incurred In recent years, Malawi has run up a crushing foreign debt of $750 million, forcing it to spend 43 percent of its export earnings from tobacco, sugar and tea on repayments. Both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are expected to provide loans to help ease the problem, but only in return for domestic changes. There is expected to be pressure, Western economists said, for reorganization of Press Holdings, the country's biggest private company. President Banda holds 90 percent of the company stock, the economists said, supposedly in trust for the nation but used sometimes to finance personal projects. A traveler, for instance, might, while driving on a long and rutted dirt track in the bush, suddenly come upon a village equipped with running water and tarred roads and neat brick bungalows and electricity. Other villages lack these amenities - indeed, are dirt poor - but then, they are not the birthplace of a close relative of the President."21-Jan-86,LIBERIA (99%); UNITED STATES (94%); KENYA (92%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%); AFRICA (79%);,"The Liberian Government plans to seek an indictment against a Citibank vice president on charges of treason based on accusations that she was involved in an unsuccessful coup, State Department and Liberian Government officials said yesterday. The Liberian Government spokesman, Carlton A. Karpeh, said in a telephone interview from Monrovia that the Liberian Government would soon present evidence against the bank executive, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, to a grand jury. He said he did not know when the jury would convene. Treason is a capital offense. Mr. Karpeh raised the possibility, however, that the Government might drop its case if Mrs. Johnson-Sirleaf agreed to take a seat in the legislature that she won in elections last October. Mrs. Johnson-Sirleaf, a Liberian who was educated in the United States, has been in prison for more than two months without being charged. She was a founder of the Liberia Action Party, one of three opposition parties that accused the ruling party of rigging the elections. She has said from prison that she would protest the election results by refusing to accept her seat. According to the official election tally, the Liberian head of state, Gen. Samuel K. Doe, was elected President with 50.9 percent of the votes, and his party, the National Democratic Party of Liberia, won 80 percent of the seats in the legislature. ''A newspaper here published that Mrs. Johnson-Sirleaf had agreed to take her seat,'' Mr. Karpeh said. ''Whether that is an indication of vindication and whether charges might be dropped, I'm not sure.'' He said the Justice Minister, Jenkins Scott, would make that determination. Mr. Scott could not be reached by telephone. A State Department official said yesterday that he could not respond to the charges against Mrs. Johnson-Sirleaf, but that American diplomats have urged the Liberian Government to insure that due process is carried out for those detained in the unsuccessful coup. Accusations of human rights abuses and charges of election irregularities have strained ties between the United States and Liberia, the largest per capita recipient of American aid in West Africa. Key members of the House and Senate have said they will seek to cut economic and military assistance to Liberia. Mrs. Johnson-Sirleaf, a 46-year-old economist who studied at Harvard, has been an outspoken critic of the Liberian Government. Last July, in a speech in Philadelphia, she called Liberian Government officials ''idiots.'' She was arrested after returning to Liberia and was sentenced to 10 years in prison for sedition. At the urging of Western diplomats, General Doe granted her clemency before the elections. A Liberian Minister of Finance until 1980, Mrs. Johnson-Sirleaf worked at the World Bank and later became Citibank's representative in Nairobi, Kenya. She took a leave of absence last summer to campaign for election in Liberia. Liberian officials have accused her of helping to finance the unsuccessful coup, which took place Nov. 12. Several hundred people were arrested, and the Government has not said how many are still being detained. Five others have been charged with treason."14-Dec-86,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (96%); UNITED STATES (95%); AFRICA (94%); ANGOLA (92%); NICARAGUA (79%);","PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE SEKO of Zaire, who met with President Reagan at the White House last week, is one of Africa's most durable leaders, having seized power in 1965 in the former Belgian Congo. Reagan Administration officials consider the 56-year-old Mr. Mobutu an ally, and he is said to be a channel for covert American aid to Jonas Savimbi's rebels in Angola. But Zaire's economy, despite aid from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank and $70 million a year from the United States, is in dire straits after years of mismanagement and corruption. In Washington, Serge Mukendi, a Zairean dissident, accused Mr. Mobutu of having amassed a fortune of $5 billion, more than Zaire's $4.5 billion foreign debt. And human rights advocates said his single-party Government had committed ''gross and systematic'' abuses. During his Washington visit, President Mobutu discussed Zaire's problems with Clyde Farnsworth of The New York Times. Following are excerpts from their conversation, which was conducted in French and English. Question. Are you one of the world's richest men? Is your wealth greater than Zaire's debt? Answer. I cannot live outside the budget. There is one sole budget, and there is a presidential allowance fund. Where would the money come from? It's just not possible. The budget is published every year. It is known down to the last centime. The World Bank audits us. Money can only leave in regulated amounts, fixed by accord with the I.M.F. I know that we disturb people in some ways and make them unhappy, and so they do everything they can to bring me down. The person that you call Mobutu and his country are victims of disinformation. My enemies say anything to try to bring me down. But I rule only through popular support. All the people are behind me. Human rights violations? They will say anything. But the people know the truth. I am not yet overthrown. I am here. For four years, the World Bank and I.M.F. have controlled everything. Q. Have you been asked to give money to the Nicaraguan contras? A. I don't have it to give.  Q. How close are you to Washington? A. There are 50 independent countries on the continent. A lot of them receive assistance from the U.S. Some appreciate it, some attack the U.S. My country is different. We get very little assistance from the U.S. Whether we do or not, we are friends. Q. What is Zaire's regional role?  A. Zaire and all independent countries of Africa are bound by the charter of the Organization for African Unity. However, there are countries that have quite a bit of money because they have oil. And they don't seem to honor this charter. Sometimes they get militarily involved in the affairs of other countries. I think the occupation of Chad is an excellent example. Chad asked Zaire to help, and we sent 3,000 men to Chad at two different times. Obviously, this was costly. We had to send them Coca-Cola and water by air. We also trained troops from Chad in Zaire. We don't expect thanks necessarily, but our allies should consider the fact that we actually did something like this, simply because we do not accept what Libya is doing. Don't forget that Zaire was the first country in Africa to establish normal diplomatic relations with Israel. So you can see why Zaire is a target of Qaddafi. Savimbi Connection? Q. Do American military supplies go through Zaire to Savimbi in Angola? A. It's simply not true. Q. Do you expect United States help with the I.M.F.? A. President Reagan, in front of the press, made a formal promise to that effect. First there must be a commitment to continue the I.M.F. program. We don't want to continue on the path that almost led to catastrophe. Q. What went wrong? A. We did a perfect job with our commitments for four years. The results have been very negative for our people, but quite positive for the wealthy countries. In other words, Zaire is a net exporter of capital. We have given back more than we actually received to begin with. Zaire will still honor its commitments, but it will no longer be an exporter of capital. In 1986, Zaire paid out $500 million to the international banking and financial community through the I.M.F. However, the international financial community did not give one dollar to Zaire. Seven African countries have experienced food riots in which people died. In Zaire, because of decisions between us and the I.M.F., there have been sacrifices, but no riots and no bloodshed."28-Jan-87,UGANDA (98%);,"A year after leading his guerrilla movement to power in Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni now finds himself mired in economic problems that could erode his popularity. Prominent Ugandans and Western donors say the economy, shattered by years of war, mismanagement and corruption, is the most serious issue facing Mr. Museveni's Government. They say, however, that the President has offered few concrete strategies. While he has brought peace to most of a country long resigned to violence, he has found it virtually impossible to translate promises of economic progress into positive performance. Some of his own policies have had a disastrous effect on Uganda's fiscal condition, according to economic specialists. In a speech this week to mark the first anniversary of the takeover, President Museveni promised to bring about economic changes. Agriculture and Industry Blaming past Governments for most of the decay, he said his National Resistance Movement would move to revive production in the devastated agricultural and industrial sectors in an effort to increase foreign exchange. He stressed ''self-reliance'' in rebuilding the economy and said foreign aid would be welcomed only if international donors did not ''interfere'' with the Government's own policies. ''In the same way we fought the hard war against Obote, we are going to fight economic stagnation and I am sure we are going to win, so let us be optimistic,'' Mr. Museveni. Milton Obote is the former leader against whom Mr. Museveni's forces fought a four-year bush war. Looking to World Bank Despite his calls for self-reliance, Mr. Museveni is now looking to the World Bank and other sources for help. As a prerequisite for additional aid, according to economists, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and others want Mr. Museveni to move forward immediately with dramatic economic changes, including devaluation of Uganda's currency, increasing key agricultural producer prices and adopting other measures to restore stability and growth. Western and Ugandan economic specialists say that Mr. Museveni, while variously labeled as a Socialist or Marxist, is above all a pragmatist. He is aware that, unless he reaches some type of agreement with those donors who are insisting on bold measures to improve the economy, he cannot hope to establish stability. Mr. Museveni inherited a treasury that contained only about $500,000 in foreign exchange, the result of profligate spending on arms and staggering corruption in the Government headed by Mr. Obote and Maj. Gen. Tito Okello, which Mr. Museveni's National Resistance Army ousted last January. $1.6 Billion Foreign Debt Ugandan and Western economic specialists say that of the $400 million the country takes in each year in export earnings, at least 90 percent of it from coffee, more than half goes toward servicing a $1.6 billion foreign debt and much of the rest is used to purchase oil and sugar and meet the army's needs for spare parts and other material. Inflation in Uganda is running as high as 200 percent, and low prices to farmers serve as a disincentive to agricultural production in a country of rich soil and mild equatorial climate. While the minimum wage is about $6 a month, the flourishing black market often sets prices locally, resulting in meat being offered for nearly $7 for two pounds. 'Not Doing Enough' ''Museveni is not doing enough,'' the Rev. Wilson Sentongo said, waiting along with scores of others in a town outside Kampala for rations of food and other supplies. ''Rehabilitation by the Government is very slow. We do not know what their plan is. They are telling us to tolerate things. Museveni has sympathy for us, we know, but the problem is supplies are not here and we need help.'' At the same time, members of Mr. Museveni's Government and many other Ugandans are deeply divided over whether the country should swallow the changes insisted on by international donors. At the center of the debate is the issue of devaluation. In its first year in office, the Government revalued the currency from 5,000 to 1,400 shillings to the dollar, saying that the move would make imports cheaper. But exports have become increasingly expensive. Devaluation Debated Some hard-line nationalists in Government insist that the cost of devaluation would be devastating. The cost of such imports as sugar, cooking oil and soap would increase significantly, they say, making the average Ugandan even worse off than he is now. Others are arguing that devaluation would earn the Government millions of dollars in revenue and encourage production in manufacturing and agriculture. They say that, if there is no currency adjustment, the Government will be forced to subsidized production. These people insist that if devaluation were introduced, an additional monthly increase in inflation would only be felt briefly and that prices would soon stabilize and inflation would slow down. ''It's not good enough for the World Bank and I.M.F. to say devalue,'' said a leading Ugandan lawyer. ''They must give us massive aid to counteract the effects of devaluation. Mr. Museveni said a war against rebels in the north continued to plague his Government, though recent victories against the insurgents, who consist of remnants of armies of Idi Amin, Mr. Obote and General Okello had brought an end to the conflict closer. Mr. Museveni's Government has virtually ended the violence and atrocities that have become synonymous with Uganda, a nation repeatedly bludgeoned by corrupt dictatorship, tribal wars and brutal human rights abuses since it gained independence from Britain in 1962."8-Mar-87,NIGERIA (99%); AFRICA (93%); UNITED STATES (79%);,"This is the African country that parlayed a $ 100-billion windfall into a national curse. The oil boom from 1973 to 1981 crippled the livelihoods of the farming majority, hooked city people on subsidized imports and saddled the nation with an estimated $ 18-billion debt. As Nigerians have since acknowledged, it was their own inept, corrupt government that squandered much of the oil money. So it borders on the astonishing that Nigeria, having been jolted by two military coups in the past 38 months, is now being lauded by the World Bank and the United States as a role model in Africa for free market reforms and responsible government. ""Nigeria has embarked on the most comprehensive economic adjustment program in Africa so far,"" said Ishrat Husain, resident representative here for the World Bank. ""We were never expecting them to do as much as they have done."" Nigeria's conversion from corrupt profligate to capitalist exemplar was not entirely voluntary. It was forced by last year's collapse of oil prices. Foreign debt became unpayable. Shippers stopped delivering goods. Economic activity in Africa's most populous country almost ground to a halt. But the past year's radical economic transformation here appears to be more than a last-chance maneuver to avoid default. It derives from the distinctively obdurate nationalism of the Nigerian people and the deft manipulation of that nationalism by Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, the country's military leader. ""Nigerians are so self-centered that they don't make rational decisions when the choices are imposed on them from the outside,"" said Prince Tony Momoh, minister of information and culture. ""Nigerians believe there are things superior to reasoning. Things such as pride."" It was pride that kept Nigeria from accepting a loan of $ 2.4 billion from the International Monetary Fund in 1985, the year Babangida seized power in a bloodless coup. The money probably would have prevented the debt crunch that brought this country to its knees last year. Shortly after coming to power, Babangida opened what became known as the ""Great IMF Debate."" In the debate, a uniquely Nigerian plebiscite-cum-shouting-match that was carried on in the pages of the country's daily press, it soon became clear that the public saw the IMF and its demand for economic reform as insidious instruments of greedy westerners. In addition, many Nigerians, having watched their leaders waste billions of dollars of oil money, said a loan would only increase the national debt by allowing officials to squirrel away more public funds in foreign banks. Babangida abided by the public's will and rejected the IMF loan. Then, he slowly began to put in place what western economists are calling the most rigorous free market reform package ever adopted in an African country. The package meets all of the demands of the IMF. In fact, economists here say it is far tougher than the IMF would have dared to demand. ""It has registered on a lot of people in the U.S. government that this is one of the most exciting economic reforms in Africa,"" said U.S. Ambassador Princeton Lyman. The reforms have led to a drastic devaluation of the naira, the currency whose one-to-one parity with the dollar had been considered an inviolate symbol of Nigerian pride. A dollar now buys nearly four naira. The cherished perquisites of the country's middle class, which had been subsidized by the grossly overvalued naira, fell victim to market forces. Car prices tripled. International air fares, which had been one of the best bargains in the world, doubled. School fees quadrupled for the 100,000 Nigerian families who send their children to study abroad. The reforms abolished an import licensing system that had made millionaires out of hundreds of Nigerian sharpies who used relatives and friends in the Ministry of Trade to obtain import licenses and resold them to businessmen desperate to import spare parts. Now businessmen simply import what they can pay for. Also scrapped were the country's six commodities boards, ineffectual agencies that had for years held down the price of farm produce. Abolition of the cocoa marketing board boosted the price of a ton of cocoa from $ 400 to $ 1,155. In broad outline, the reform package penalized the urban elite in favor of farmers. This is a risky business in Africa, where political power is concentrated among city dwellers. And while the reforms embraced the free enterprise theology that the IMF, World Bank and U.S. government are preaching across Africa, Babangida appears to have persuaded a large portion of the Nigerian public that his reforms are ""home-grown."" Playing to a nationalism that is more potent here than anywhere else in black Africa, Babangida said in his 1987 budget speech that ""our structural adjustment program was produced by Nigerians for Nigerians."" ""It is a political masterpiece,"" said Husain, the senior World Bank official. ""If he had done exactly the same thing under the aegis of the IMF, there would have been riots or a coup d'etat."" The economic adjustment package has so pleased defensive creditors that Nigeria has been able to quietly reschedule most of its debt. Two years ago, 44 percent of export earnings went to service foreign debt. This year, the government says, that burden has been cut in half. While international banks and western governments are delighted with the reform package, it has provoked howls of distress from the country's manufacturers. The reforms sharply reduced the number of imports banned from Nigeria, making local manufacturers vulnerable to world competition for the first time. ""The very existence of the industrial sector is seriously threatened,"" said Chief Jerome Udoji, president of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria. He warned of mass unemployment, bankruptcies and ""a return to the former colonial days of a trade economy."" Nigerians are paying a painful price for reform. Average per capita income for the country's 105 million people is 25 percent less now than in 1974. College graduates are all but unable to find professional-level jobs, according to recent press reports here. The nation's factories, according to government figures, operate at less than 30 percent of capacity. These warnings have pushed the government into some minor policy adjustments. But, according to Information Minister Momoh, the government is determined not to shelter uncompetitive local businesses simply because they are Nigerian. ""The manufacturers have not yet reconciled themselves to the fact that we are trying to force a market economy on everyone. We are telling people that if things are too expensive, don't buy them. The joy is that it hurts everyone,"" said Momoh. Homilies on free enterprise and honest government have become standard fare for Nigerian ministers in the past year. But western economists and businessmen say such rhetoric has been slow to change corrupt government contracting methods. Payoffs and kickbacks remain essential ingredients in most government spending processes, these sources say. In addition, the Nigerian government, despite its professed devotion to marketplace solutions, continues to fund expensive projects that have little chance of clearing a profit. The grandiose Adjaokuta steel works, for example, already has cost an estimated $ 3 billion. Experts say it will never make steel at prices competitive with the world market. Despite these blemishes, Nigeria has moved faster and further toward fundamental economic reform than most western observers believed possible when Babangida came to power 20 months ago. Fortunately for the government's survival, the reform has coincided with two years of bumper crops. Local prices of staple foods have fallen in the past year. Unlike most African countries facing several years of austerity as they rebuild their economies, Nigeria also has oil. Correctly managed, the oil revenue, even in a weak world market, can cushion the transition from an oil-addicted to a mixed economy, according to economists. Sustained economic recovery depends on the ability of the present government to survive and keep its reforms in place. ""If the government can sustain these changes, Nigeria could be the shining star of Africa,"" said Husain of the World Bank, which has committed about $ 1 billion in loans to support the reform package. The reforms last month earned the IMF's approval. A standby arrangement, which triggered a move by Nigeria's creditors to stretch out their loans, gives Nigeria the right to borrow up to $ 850 million from the IMF. Proud Nigeria, however, still hates the IMF. According to Momoh, Babangida's government has vowed never to borrow a penny."26-Apr-87,NIGERIA (99%); AFRICA (95%); UNITED STATES (92%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%);,"Things fall apart. That phrase, the title of a novel by Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe, describes this country's fitful passage into modernity. Nigeria is hot, crowded and noisy. Totems of its culture are hard work and armed robbery, doctorates and tribal hatred, family loyalty and fast cars. Its people heap scorn upon themselves as corrupt, inefficient and self-destructive. But even as things fall apart, Nigeria somehow has managed to meld itself into a nation. Against all odds, things come together. Out of the Biafran war, Africa's bloodiest tribal conflict, has come a lasting peace -- a feat of forgiveness remarkable in world history. Out of the berserk corruption of Nigeria's oil boom has come an economic reform package that, if sustained, will be a model for this continent. Out of the failure of two attempts at American-style democracy has emerged a moderate military regime that respects human rights, allows freedom of expression and vows to dissolve itself so that Nigeria can take another crack at democratic government. There are no guarantees these achievements will last in this fractious land. Little about Nigeria fits western images of Africa. The big game is long since dead, gone the way of the American buffalo. Hunger is rarely a problem; the soil is rich, rain is plentiful. Race is a moot issue. White people never could stand the swampy West African heat, so few settled here. Instead, there are millions upon millions of Nigerians -- 105 million is the best recent estimate. One of every six Africans lives in Nigeria, the continent's most populous nation. The country's population is growing at a rate that is among the highest in the world. In less than 50 years, according to a conservative projection, Nigeria will have 618 million people -- more than the present population of all Africa. Images of Nigeria are not nearly as romantic as those of safari Africa. The bush has been invaded by freeways, farms, universities, oil wells, slums, suburbs, breweries and mosques. But these images say far more about what Africa is and where it is going. If the world's poorest continent is going anywhere, Nigeria is likely to get there first. Nigerians themselves are not at all shy about explaining how important their country is. ""The world should see Nigeria for what it is: the country with the largest concentration of black people on earth and therefore the torchbearer for the black race,"" says Prince Tony Momoh, a wealthy businessman, influential traditional leader and minister of information in the Nigerian governmemt. Besides sheer numbers, Nigeria possesses wealth that distinguishes it from the rest of the continent. Its gross national product is bigger than South Africa's and more than half that of all black Africa. It is the world's ninth largest oil producer. At current consumption levels, Nigeria has 35 years of oil and 100 years of natural gas. Above ground, there are tens of thousands of university-trained professionals -- the country produced more college graduates in the 1970s than did all of Africa in colonial times. Africa's only Nobel laureate in literature, Wole Soyinka, is a Nigerian. The nation is the continent's fountainhead for music, art, literature and, most recently, hard-nosed economic reform. Yet the ""torchbearer"" has a habit of tripping over its own riches and burning itself badly. The oil boom of the 1970s gave Nigeria a $ 100 billion windfall. When the boom ended, the country had an $ 18 billion foreign debt, a population addicted to foreign luxuries and a farm economy that forgot how to grow food. A generation was weaned on avarice. Corruption hypnotized the national psyche. ""Big men"" ordered gold bathtubs from Europe and set fire to government buildings that contained records linking them to corruption. Lagos, the port capital, became the world's most expensive city. It became notorious for all-day traffic jams, piracy in the harbor and pandemic bribery. In 1977, as the oil money flooded in, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, then head of the military government, said that Nigeria is ""a place where people are prepared to destroy anything, to cover up any crime, if doing so promotes their economic interest or might."" And then there were the coups, the assassinations and the civil war. Six military coups in 26 years, three heads of state murdered. Gen. Murtala Mohammed was shot to death while stuck in traffic. In the 1967-70 Biafran war, nearly a million Nigerians were killed or starved to death. Like most of the countries carved out of colonial Africa, Nigeria is a geographical and historical fluke. It was created by a British colonial governor-general and named by a foreign correspondent from The Times of London (a woman who later married the governor-general). In a region larger than California, Arizona and New Mexico combined, Nigeria brought together tribes that had fought each other for centuries, made countrymen of mutually suspicious Moslems and Christians and gave the gift of citizenship to people who spoke 395 different languages. The Yoruba, of whom there are about 20 million, are one of three major ethnic groups in Nigeria. They descend from an ancient trading civilization and they dominate the country's largest cities. The sensibilities of the Yoruba have helped forge the character of Nigeria. ""When a Yoruba man says 'absolutely no,' he means 'let us negotiate,' "" explains Bade Ajuwon, a Yoruba man and director of the Institute of African Cultural Studies at the University of Ife. ""It is the negotiation, the struggle, that we want. It is our life, our mentality, our blood,"" says Ajuwon. ""The Yoruba have a proverb that says that only the thing for which you have struggled will last."" A taste for struggle has charged Nigeria with an aggressiveness unique in Africa. In a country where ""absolutely no"" means maybe, where a shouting match is a routine warm-up to a business deal, where a man doesn't know if a woman is interested until she tells him to get lost, there is a cultural logic behind Nigeria's penchant for falling apart while coming together. The history of independent black Africa is that of traditional cultures reinventing themselves to accommodate western ideas and technology. It has been a halting, confusing process. Nigeria, with its wealth, its huge pool of educated people, its aggressiveness, has reinvented itself at a higher velocity than the rest of black-ruled Africa. It has not been any smoother here, just faster. Consider the four-lane expressway that connects the country's two largest cities, Lagos and Ibadan. The white metal guard rails that separate oncoming traffic have been pulverized for more than 100 miles by cars gone out of control. The railing lies limp and useless on the median strip like long pieces of overcooked spaghetti. This twisted reminder of mayhem does not prevent traffic from traveling at between 90 and 100 miles an hour, except for cars that are capable of going faster. Every few miles on the median strip, between giant ant hills, the mangled railing and the burned-out, picked-clean skeletons of cars that didn't survive, are billboards that warn: ""Slow Down -- Speed Kills."" Freeways, built in the 1970s with the oil boom money, are a good place to watch modern urban Nigeria collide with itself and with traditional rural Africa. Market women set up shop on the freeways. They walk to work from nearby farm villages, carrying their wares on their heads and their babies on their backs. As their children play naked on the asphalt shoulders, the women sell yams and forest rats, goat meat and toothpicks, warm beer and cola nuts. Cola nuts are popular with fast drivers. The nuts, bitter with caffeine, keep them awake. This is particularly important at night when the market women go home and the armed robbers come out. Unlike much of Africa, there are lots of guns in private hands in Nigeria. Highways offer a place for people who have guns to meet people who have cars and money. Every few months, the voluble Nigerian press explodes in outrage about armed robbery. That happened early this year when the wife of former head of state Gen. Obasanjo, the leader who said his countrymen would commit any crime for money, was shot to death in traffic on a highway in Lagos. Lynda Obasanjo was ordered out of her new Peugeot 505 by four young men with guns. When she failed to move quickly, she was shot several times. She was pulled from the car and left to die in the street. The robbers took the car. Shortly after the murder, Nigeria's two largest news weeklies ran cover stories on ""Murder Incorporated"" and ""Return of the Assassins."" In a front-page story, The Sunday Sketch, a Lagos daily, wrote, ""Our society is under siege, its citizens are terrorized and dehumanized. Somebody somewhere should wake up and diffuse this siege before we all go out of our minds."" Disorienting change has been a given in Nigerian life since the country became independent in 1960. Since then, the economy has turned upside down, boomed as no African economy has ever boomed and then fizzled. Oil all but killed off the farm. Farm exports fell from 90 to 3 percent of total export earnings. The world's leading exporter of palm oil and peanuts became one of the world's leading importers of palm oil and peanuts. Oil took over. Oil money flooded the cities, and so did Nigerians. The percentage of the population living in cities doubled, from 15 to 30 percent, and the number of cities with more than a half-million people jumped from two to nine. Lagos became black Africa's biggest city, with about 4 million people. Primary school enrollment tripled. It is now close to 100 percent. Universities sprang up across the country. As recently as 1985, more than 100,000 Nigerian families had one or more children studying abroad. Each year about 35,000 Nigerian students attend American universities. A generation of Nigerians has grown up in the aggressive pursuit of western-style success. But that pursuit has not obliterated traditional African culture. In a country that comes together by falling apart, cultural dissonance is a way of life. The same daily newspapers that feature turgid analyses of structural adjustment policy also carry news bulletins about regional reduction in bride prices. Well-to-do families, whose children have doctorates from the world's finest universities, routinely appease the spirits of dead elders by placing full-page advertisements in the newspapers. The ads, which always feature a flattering photograph of the departed, remind the spirits that the living still care. Consider the ooni of Ife. Among the Yoruba, the ooni (pronounced OWE-nee) is the top oba or traditional leader. By tradition he is a direct descendant of Oduduwa, who came to earth in the town of Ife (about 150 miles northeast of Lagos) and there fathered the human race. In precolonial Nigeria, the ooni was a religious leader and a warlord. In the colonial era, he was one of many traditional leaders coopted by the British in their system of indirect rule. The current holder of the title, Oba Okunade Sijuwade Olubuse II, rides in a cream-colored 240D stretch Mercedes limousine with a purple and white license plate that says: ""Ooni of Ife."" When he appears in public, usually clad in gold brocade and slippers, an official trumpeter blasts out a loud riff. As a direct descendant of the progenitor of the human race, the ooni does not grant interviews. But he is mindful of the value of media exposure. To that end, he has retained Basha Alperin, an American woman with media experience. ""I do video for the ooni,"" explains Alperin. She shoots videotape of the ooni receiving petitioners in his palace in Ife, performing religious ceremonies (there are some 400 gods in the pantheon of the Yoruba religion) and traveling on official business. In independent Nigeria, traditional rulers such as the ooni have almost no official power. Most Yoruba are Christian or Moslem. The ooni himself is a millionaire businessman who juggles religious and entrepreneurial obligations. (His late predecessor, a church-going Anglican, was not above using his influence to line his pockets. As head of the Ife District Native Authority, he gave an exclusive concession to exploit Ife Forest to a timber company he partly owned.) It is possible, given enough cash, to buy a traditional title. Many wealthy businessmen have spruced up their image by adding ""Chief"" or ""Oba"" to their business cards. Yet Nigerians continue to respect traditional leaders, whose vague authority has survived the colonial administration, two civilian regimes and five changes of military leadership. ""No government has ever succeeded in reaching rural areas without using the traditional leaders,"" says Information Minister Tony Momoh. In the current military regime, obas -- even obas who bought their titles -- are seen by the government as legitimate spokesmen for the demands of local communities. Contradictions rest easy with Nigerians, for whom economic, social and political collisions are the stuff of everyday life. The most striking of these contradictions is the coexistence of the country's masochistic appetite for self-condemnation and its chest-thumping nationalistic pride. Titles of popular books by Nigerians include: ""Another Hope Betrayed,"" ""The Trouble With Nigeria"" and ""Always a Loser -- A Novel About Nigeria."" A recent newspaper column about national ineptitude was headlined: ""It wouldn't be Nigerian if it worked."" Nearly four years ago, the federal government came up with WAI -- the War Against Indiscipline. Unique in Africa, WAI amounted to a government admission that Nigerians are intolerably rude and messy. WAI posters were distributed throughout the country, urging people to stand in line, pick up their garbage and be nicer. In a country that blames itself for squandering billions of dollars in oil revenue, self-flagellation has become a national rite. O. Gbola Ajao, who teaches at the College of Medicine in Ibadan, wrote recently to the New Nigerian newspaper: ""Some years ago we were asking about developing a tourist industry in Nigeria. What a laugh! How will any foreigner in his right mind want to come for vacation in a place like Nigeria? Even those of us born there are always looking for one excuse or another to get out of the place."" Yet, even as they subject themselves and their leaders to withering condemnation, Nigerians have been extraordinarily intolerant of outside criticism or advice. ""Nigerians are not rational,"" says Tony Momoh, principal spokesman for the military government of Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Babangida. ""We would prefer to go hungry to being told what to do. I can't think of any other African country doing such an irrational thing. But there is more to a Nigerian than reasoning."" For more than five years, Nigeria rejected a loan from the International Monetary Fund that was conditioned on economic reform. The IMF's demand that Nigeria's currency, the naira, be devalued was popularly viewed as an imperialistic attempt to castrate the country. Other reforms, which threatened the perquisites of the politically powerful middle class, were portrayed in the local press as the sneaky schemes of greedy westerners. When the Babangida government seized power after a bloodless coup in 1985 -- as unpayable foreign debts mounted and oil revenues continued to shrink -- it became clear that prideful opposition to economic reform would bankrupt the country. Unable to overcome Nigeria's pride, Babangida outwitted it. In one of the neatest economic maneuvers in African history, the general told the IMF that Nigeria didn't want the loan. Then, as the country rejoiced in having told the IMF where to go, the military government implemented an IMF-style reform package that western economists describe as the most comprehesive on the continent. The package has led to a liberal rescheduling of foreign debts and eased Nigeria's financial crisis. The reforms, which penalize the urban elite in favor of farmers, are far stricter than officials from the IMF or World Bank say they would have dared demand. And Babangida, a former tank commander with an engaging smile, has sold them to his country as ""our structural adjustment program produced by Nigerians for Nigerians."" Thus far, with Nigeria's pride appeased, both Babangida and the reforms enjoy wide popularity. In postboom Nigeria, money is tight. With devaluation of the naira, the price of automobiles, foreign schooling and international air travel has increased three-fold. Austerity is a dreary and unavoidable fact of life. But Nigerians seem determined not to let the dreariness get out of hand. In Lagos, Nike Marinho designs and sells formal wear for weddings, birth ceremonies, funerals and installations of obas. The clothing is of traditional design, brilliantly colored, individually tailored, intricately beaded. A bargain outfit for a man or woman costs $ 300 to $ 500. An expensive outfit can run $ 1,200 or more. Marinho says her customers feel obligated to buy three or four outfits for a marriage or a funeral, affairs that usually involve several gatherings over two or three days. She acknowledges that her customers have far less money than they used to. But she says they still buy three or four outfits, often borrowing the money. ""We Nigerians are gullible for dressing up,"" she says. Olagoke Olabisi, dean of the engineering department at Lagos State University, recently purchased four new outfits to wear to the four gatherings commemorating the death of his father. The clothes cost more than Olabisi could afford, he says. Asked if anyone would notice if he were to wear an old outfit or even wear a new outfit twice, Olabisi replied: ""I would notice."""19-Aug-87,UGANDA (99%); KENYA (92%); RWANDA (92%);,"Six months ago, a small-time Ugandan smuggler who sold five gallons of gasoline in neighboring countries could make three times more in one day than a Ugandan Government minister received as a monthly salary. With cans of fuel strapped to rickety bicycles or balanced on top of their heads, Ugandan peasants would travel across the border to Kenya or Rwanda and easily get $20 for gasoline for which they paid the equivalent of $2. Back in Uganda, they could sell the foreign currency at the black market rate of 16,000 Ugandan shillings to the dollar, reaping a net profit of 288,000 shillings. This allowed them to purchase scarce commodities like soap, sugar and cooking oil. A Government minister's monthly salary last January was about 90,000 shillings, and the minimum monthly wage was 10,000 shillings at the official exchange rate, which was not enough to buy a stem of bananas or two pounds of sugar. Business these days, however, is not as profitable for the illegal traders. The price of gasoline, which was set artificially low, has been increased by 50 percent to bring it closer to the commodity's real market value, thus diminishing the incentive for smuggling. Agricultural Economy Sought In this and other ways, the Government of President Yoweri Museveni is attempting to resuscitate an agriculturally based economy shattered by years of war, mismanagement and corruption. Last January, a year after Mr. Museveni seized power, prominent Ugandans and Western donors said the state of the economy was the most serious issue facing the Government but that the President had offered few concrete strategies to deal with it. Some of Mr. Museveni's early policies were criticized as having had a disastrous effect on Uganda's fiscal condition. But since then, economic specialists say, the President has come to terms with the need for bold measures to improve the economy. He has reached new loan agreements with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank that require tight monetary policies. His Government has devalued the currency by more than 75 percent, introduced a new shilling worth 100 old shillings and levied a 30 percent tax on all money converted from old to new in a move to reduce the overall money supply. The old currency had been made almost worthless by spiraling inflation and a huge gap between official and black market exchange rates. Mr. Museveni has also announced increases of up to 500 percent in prices paid to farmers, as an incentive to revive agricultural production. The Government currently derives two-thirds of its income from coffee exports, which account for 95 percent of Uganda's export earnings. Civil Servants' Salaries Up Mr. Museveni also doubled the salaries of civil servants to restore some of their lost purchasing power. Uganda is to receive $310 million in aid from major donor nations over the next year, $50 million more than the country had sought to finance imports of essential raw materials, spare parts and capital goods needed to get idle productive capacity employed again. The Paris Club of bilateral and multilateral aid donors has rescheduled all the debt repayments Uganda should have made in the current financial year, saving the country $66 million. Uganda's total debt service liability had been running at about $200 million a year, which represented about half of its export earnings. ''The economic reforms represent an intellectual and policy watershed,'' said one Western diplomat familiar with the economy. ''The President had intensive dialogues with the I.M.F. and World Bank that had the quality of a graduate seminar in economics and he is deeply committed to these reforms. The Western donors did not beat him up and make him cry uncle.'' But Ugandan economists, Western diplomats and others agree that it will take years to pull the country from its economic quagmire. Mr. Museveni inherited a treasury of only about $500,000 in foreign exchange, the result of profligate spending on arms and staggering corruption in the Government headed by Milton Obote, the former leader against whom Mr. Museveni's forces fought a four-year bush war, and Maj. Gen. Tito Okello. Mr. Museveni's National Resistance Army ousted Mr. Okello's Government in January 1986. From 1970 to 1985, according to Government statistics, the country's agricultural output fell by 30 percent and industrial output by more than 50 percent. Per capita income declined by more than 40 percent. A study by an international labor organization showed that Uganda's factories were operating at less than 20 percent of capacity because of a chronic shortage of foreign exchange to buy imported raw materials and spare parts. ''It won't be easy, no matter how sound our economic policies,'' a Uganda economist said. ''The economy is still shrinking, but in Uganda, we should try to look at the bright side for a change. Three years ago, the gross domestic product fell about 3 percent. Last year, it shrank by less than 1 percent. That has to be considered good in Uganda.''"23-Aug-87,BURKINA FASO (96%); AFRICA (96%); UNITED STATES (92%); FRANCE (79%); ETHIOPIA (79%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%);,"The young man in striped socks and jogging shorts with a referee's whistle around his neck looked familiar. It was Capt. Thomas Sankara, 38 years old, the President of Burkina Faso, refereeing a soccer match here between his even younger ministers and a team of local farmers. The voice on the national radio sounded familiar. It was Captain Sankara, before a national commission, detailing his assets: one nine-year-old Renault, one refrigerator, three guitars, six bicycles, $560 in the bank, a weekly salary of $110 and $2,200 outstanding on his home mortgage. Shunned by Older Leaders Unorthodox, outspoken and apparently uncorrupt, Burkina Faso's impatient young President is shunned by Africa's older leaders as the continent's enfant terrible. But to much of Africa's younger generation - young Africans who have known only the disappointments of the independence era - Captain Sankara is an angry young man to their liking. ''Sankara incarnates African youth,'' one essayist wrote glowingly in a recent issue of Jeune Afrique, a regional magazine. ''Elevated, poised, incisive. It's the style of the black man of the modern age. After so many cruel deceptions and wounds inflicted on Africans by so-called 'revolutionary' leaders, I cannot help but be sympathetic to the style and thought of Thomas Sankara.'' When Captain Sankara, then a 33-year-old parachutist, seized power four years ago, when the country was still known as Upper Volta, he told his eight million citizens that the old ways were over. Third-Poorest Nations There was little debate that the old ways had failed. According to the World Bank, Burkina Faso ranks as the third-poorest nation in the world, ahead of Ethiopia and Bangladesh. Locked 300 miles from the sea in the heart of sub-Saharan West Africa, this dry Arizona-size nation has seen little progress in 27 years of independence. First, Captain Sankara waged war on corruption. He sold all the luxury cars of the previous regime, decreed the fuel-efficient Renault 5 (marketed in the United States as Le Car) to be the standard car for ministers and instructed all ministers to fly economy class. A year after taking power, his Government changed the name of the country to Burkina Faso, which means ''Land of Upright Men.'' Attacking the state bureaucracy, he cut civil servants' wages, slashed their housing and transportation allowances and abolished a head tax the peasantry used to pay to support the civil service. Finally, to wake up the bureaucrats, he ordered them to take up weekly athletics. President Sets the Example ''There is a choice to make - either we continue to give more than 60 percent of the budget to 25,000 civil servants - 0.3 percent of the population -or we decide to look at the rest of the masses,'' he said. Setting the example, the President took a salary cut and started playing soccer with his ministers Saturdays. ''I earned a certain salary in the old army,'' he said recently, talking about some unhappy professionals who have left Burkina Faso. ''I lost this salary because of the revolution. If I wasn't with the revolution, I would have fled too.'' Early on, he sent a clear signal on corruption. Theft From African Bank In 1984, evidence mounted that three officers of a major West African development bank had stolen $22 million in deposits. One of the officers pledged to repay the money, and most West African leaders showed little inclination to pursue the matter. But, by chance, in October 1984 Burkina Faso took the rotating chairmanship of the bank. Captain Sankara returned from a meeting, with the three bank officers handcuffed aboard his plane. Today, the men are serving 15-year jail terms in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso's capital. An indefatigible and often erratic advocate of change, Burkina Faso's young President also turned his energy to changing his desert nation's ancient society. Interest in Women's Rights In a dizzying series of decrees, he shut nightclubs, banned prostitution and banned begging. He set up ''solidarity compounds'' to teach artisan skills to beggars and prostitutes. Recently, he proposed holding a world conference on prostitution in Ouagadougou. Captain Sankara's concern over prostitution is part of a wider interest in women's rights. Women hold one-quarter of the ministerial portfolios here - budget, culture, health, family affairs and tourism and environment - taking what is probably the highest proportion of Cabinet posts in any African country. Burkinabe often complain that the country pays dearly for the President's hasty decisions. For example, earlier this year the President announced a self-sufficiency campaign. Fruit imports were banned and citizens were ordered to appear at official events dressed only in clothes made of local homespun cotton. But the import ban threatened to set off a tariff war with Burkina Faso's major trading partner, Ivory Coast. Migrant Burkinabe workers pick most of Ivory Coast's fruit. The national cloth is not as durable as imported cloth, and national looms are unable to keep up with the demand. 'Imperialists' Are the Demons To keep up with flagging revolutionary fervor, Captain Sankara speaks his mind in public, flaying the West in language that most other African leaders dropped years ago. His major demons are ''the imperialists'' and ''the local bourgeoisie.'' In Maore, the language spoken by half of Burkina Faso's population, these terms translate, respectively, as ''the bad whites'' and ''the white blacks.'' It is unclear exactly who the imperialists are. Half of Burkina Faso's national budget is paid by foreign aid. Ouagadougou is believed to have one of the highest concentrations of aid agencies in the world - 110 are officially registered. Opposition From Unions ''We see through all that imperialist talk - we know who gives all the aid -France, Germany, the United States, Canada,'' said one Burkinabe who says he is hostile to the revolution. Organized opposition to Captain Sankara and his revolution comes mainly from the civil service trade unions. In July, Amnesty International reported that 30 union members had been arrested. By this month, most had been released, Government officials say. Addressing the unionists, the national radio used its standard phrases. It spoke of ''the need to put an end to the feverish agitation of these sorcerer's apprentices and hardened criminals, the darlings of international imperialism.''  Visas for French Citizens On the international scene, there is little friction between Burkina Faso and the Reagan Administration, despite the left-wing speechmaking. France, the former colonial power here, has also learned to live with Captain Sankara's verbal sparring. In November, Burkina Faso was the only member nation to boycott the regular conference of French-speaking African countries in Togo. More recently, Captain Sankara started requiring visas of French citizens - a move designed to retaliate against new French visa requirements, which many Africans see as discriminatory. Captain Sankara also took on the French airline U.T.A. and threatened to withdraw its landing rights in Ouagadougou if the company did not stop flying to South Africa. The threat was later dropped. Last November, when President Francois Mitterrand stopped in Burkina Faso to try to patch things up, Captain Sankara startled guests at a state dinner by dressing down his guest for ''neo-colonialism.''' Retorting that his host was ''young and impertinent,'' President Mitterrand placed his prepared speech in his pocket and delivered an impromptu one-hour reply. He concluded: ''Sankara is a disturbing person. With him it is impossible to sleep in peace. He does not leave your conscience alone.''"11-Nov-87,NIGER (99%); LIBYAN ARAB JAMAHIRIYA (95%); CHAD (94%); UNITED STATES (94%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%); FRANCE (91%); COTE D'IVOIRE (79%);   LIBYA (95%);,"President Seyni Kountche of the West African country of Niger died of a brain tumor in a Paris hospital today after 13 years in office. The 56-year-old President was flown to Paris on Saturday for his sixth hospital visit since suffering a mild heart attack last December. A few hours before the President's death, the Niger radio announced that Col. Ali Seybou had been named acting head of state because of Mr. Kountche's ''very worrying'' state of health. Colonel Seybou, Chief of Staff of the army, was a cousin of the former President. With the death of Mr. Kountche, the United States and France lose a quiet ally in Chad's war against Libya. Niger, a largely desert nation of about six million people, shares a 250-mile border with Libya. Mr. Kountche, who served for 12 years in the French colonial army, was suspicious of Libya's leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. Relations at a Low Level Since taking power in a coup in 1974, the conservative Niger leader kept relations with his northern neighbor at a low level. Mr. Kountche was said to resent Libyan broadcasts to Niger in local languages, and he accused Libya of training Tuareg groups to destablilize his Government. The Tuaregs are a nomadic, fiercely independent Berber group. Last December, it was reported that France secretly used Niger's military airfield at Dirkou to parachute arms and supplies to Chadian Government forces in the Tibesti Mountains of Chad. The airfield was renovated by American engineers in 1984. Today, President Francois Mitterrand said he regretted the loss of ''one of the most loyal friends of France.'' Last weekend, the African leader was flown to Paris in a plane provided by the French President. During his tenure, Mr. Kountche weathered three coup attempts, and Niger's new leader is expected to face challenges to his power. The country he inherits is one of the poorest in the world. According to the World Bank, the per capita income is $200 a year, the 10th lowest recorded. Twice Ravaged by Drought Twice in the last 20 years, the thinly populated nation almost twice the size of Texas has been ravaged by drought. Mr. Kountche took power at the height of the 1969-1974 drought, promising to end corruption in the distribution of food aid. But during the next drought, in 1983, a group of young officers, charging that corruption and nepotism was rife in government, took part in an unsuccessful coup In recent years, the United States has been the main food donor to Niger. President Kountche visited Washington in 1984 and Vice President Bush visited Niamey, the capital, in 1985. The major source of recent growth in Niger has been uranium, the nation's largest export. In 1971, Niger's uranium mines in the Air mountains went into production under the management of Somair, a uranium mining company controlled by the French Atomic Energy Agency. In the oil crisis of the 1970's, uranium prices rose and Niger enjoyed a small boom. Since then, uranium prices have fallen sharply and Niger has had to reschedule its debt payments."20-Nov-87,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (96%); AFRICA (92%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%);","This country is a long-suffering student in the free-market school of how not to be an economic basket case. For four years it courageously has done what the western financial experts said it must do. It has stopped wasting money on white-elephant projects and begun paying farmers prices that give them an incentive to grow food. It has lifted price controls and devalued its currency. That is one view of Zaire, supported by mountains of economic reports and many very long speeches. There is another, decidedly more cynical view, also supported by many observers here. It goes like this: Zaire is a den of unregenerate thieves. Its president and top ministers mouth the free-market lingo that the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Reagan administration like to hear, while continuing to fill foreign bank accounts with loot. No government project is begun without payoffs. Payoffs are so ubiquitous and so exorbitant that many projects are never completed. Civil servants regard extortion as a part of their job description. The murky truth about Zaire, sub-Saharan Africa's second largest country, seems to be that both of these views are true and false. Corrupt Zaire is reforming as never before; reforming Zaire is still corrupt. The IMF and World Bank were invited back to Zaire in 1983, after several years' absence, to rescue this country from unpayable debts and its own venality. Their advice, after four years, appears to have taken some of the bite out of what many Africa scholars call the ""kleptocratic"" state. But not even the western economists who designed and help implement the reforms are willing to say they see a new dawn of good government. ""If you think structural adjustment is going to turn Zaire around, you are a bit naive,"" said one western economist who monitors reform here. ""Corruption is an ethic. An economic program does not and cannot change a social malaise."" What reform has wrought here in this vast, resource-rich country is a mixed bag. Western governments have agreed not to tempt Zairian officials with more kickback-generating big projects, such as hydroelectric dams or office centers, which the country does not need and cannot afford. And yet, according to a well-informed western diplomat, a public hospital in Kinshasa was completed this year at 200 percent of cost -- 100 percent to build the hospital, 100 percent for payoffs to government officials. The government has ordered that farmers be paid prices that are high enough to motivate them to grow food. Where the prices have been paid, there has been an impressive increase in food production. And yet many middlemen across rural Zaire refuse to cut their exorbitant profits and do not pay fair-market prices to farmers. Consequently, those farmers refuse to grow more food than they need for their families. Zaire remains a food importer in spite of its enormous agricultural potential. The new minister in charge of economic policy is a brilliant, hard-working and honest technocrat who western diplomats agree is the best-qualified Zairian ever to hold such power. And yet the country's authoritarian president, Mobutu Sese Seko, recently saw fit to dispatch a government-owned DC8 airliner to Venezuela 32 times to pick up 5,000 sheep for his private farm. In the halls of the United Nations in New York and in a number of western capitals there has been a lot of sympathetic rhetoric this year about the intractable economic problems of poor African countries such as Zaire. A recent report on Africa's economic crisis appealed to western governments to help the African countries that have ""courageously"" implemented reform programs. The report said that even as these countries have tried to correct past mistakes and rebuild their economies, they have suffered ""a calamitous decline."" They have been hit, the report said, with a double whammy of unpayable debts and falling commodity prices, which have dropped to their lowest levels in 30 years. Zaire exemplifies this bad luck. The government says that in the past four years it has paid $ 2 billion in interest on its $ 6 billion foreign debt. This is a quarter of its export earnings over that period and half of the government's budget. Debt payments devoured most of Zaire's new loans from the IMF and the World Bank. In the process, Zaire, which the World Bank lists as the ninth-poorest country in the world, became a net exporter of hard currency. While this was going on, the price of the country's main export, copper, collapsed. Consumer prices rose and life for the common man in Zaire, always miserable, became more so. The country was ""risking a social explosion,"" according to a senior Zairian official. This was not what the U.S. government and other sympathetic donors had in mind when they pressed structural reform on Zaire. Accordingly, this past spring the country was given a debt reprieve. The Paris Club, a group of western creditor governments, granted Zaire six years' grace on its bilateral debts and extended payment periods for up to 15 years. The agreement was, according to an official in Zaire's Ministry of Finance, ""without precedent. No country in Africa had been treated as generously before."" Since the spring, the World Bank has promised Zaire $ 165 million in loans to support imports. The IMF has come up with another $ 142 million loan, half of which does not have to be repaid for 10 years. Zaire's bad economic fortune and its four years as a quasi-faithful student of structural reform were important factors in its receiving this money. But there was something else involved. This government has friends in Washington. ""Our main interest is making sure that this big country, as big as all of Europe, does not fall to pieces, endangering the stability of all of central and southern Africa,"" said one senior western diplomat here. The United States, which has had a long and secretive relationship with Mobutu's government, is first among those western countries that have kept Zaire from falling to pieces. Last spring, a senior IMF official in Washington reportedly resigned in protest because the U.S. government was pressing the fund to ease lending conditions for Zaire. Sources here say the U.S. government was also a major force in the Paris Club's decision in May to reschedule Zaire's debts. U.S. foreign aid to Zaire is now about $ 60 million a year, the second-highest figure in sub-Saharan Africa. The quid pro quo for American largess goes far beyond Zaire's efforts at free-market reform. It is tied to the country's western orientation and its strategic position in southern Africa. Zaire is the largest, most consistent ally of the United States in the region. The American Embassy in Kinshasa is one of the largest on the continent. U.S. military forces regularly conduct maneuvers in Zaire. According to diplomats here and officials in Washington, Mobutu's government has allowed the Central Intelligence Agency to use the southern Zairian air base of Kamina to airlift arms to rebels fighting the Marxist government in Angola. Representatives of the rebel Union for the Total Liberation of Angola (UNITA) have a secret but semiofficial status at Kinshasa's international airport. A witness saw them meet a commercial airliner there last month and usher foreign journalists around customs and immigration officials. They took the reporters to a private aircraft at the airport and flew them to the war zone in southern Angola. Mobutu has categorically denied any role by Zaire in helping to supply or support the South African- and U.S.-backed UNITA rebels. When asked what the UNITA people were doing at Kinshasa's airport, Zaire's minister of information, Mandungu Bula Nyati, insisted that they were not there. ""It is not possible. It cannot be possible,"" he said. Thomas M. Callaghy, an assistant professor of political science at Columbia University, is one of a number of specialists on Zaire who take the cynical view. He argues that the Mobutu government has adroitly used U.S. strategic interests in southern Africa to keep open the spigots of western money. At the same time, he says, it blocks substantive reforms that would cut into corrupt practices among Mobutu's inner circle of ministers. Shortly after the IMF and World Bank returned to Zaire for another try at economic reform, Callaghy wrote: ""There is little in the history of Zaire's economy . . . that would lead most observers to conclude that Mobutu is seriously undertaking substantial economic reforms. Indeed, the corruption and mismanagement which have been associated with Mobutu and his ruling elite are the very elements which keep them in power."" Economists and diplomats here who have watched the reform process firsthand in recent years say that Callaghy's bleak view is now only half right. One economist acknowledges that ""everything we try to do stops when it cuts too close to the bone"" -- meaning Mobutu, his family and his senior ministers. Another says ""the solution for getting the most out of your money is not to come here at all."" But there is a consensus among western officials directing assistance programs in Zaire that some of the broadest avenues for graft have been closed. As one diplomat said, ""Leakage in the system has gone down significantly since 1983. Reform has weeded out those who are there only to steal money."" The biggest leak for years was in the revenues of Gecamines, the state mining corporation. In the past, millions of dollars in copper and cobalt revenue disappeared without a trace. Now those revenues are accounted for in a procedure supervised by the World Bank. Besides plugging leaks in the ""kleptocratic"" system, many western donors are trying to steer clear of the system. They target small-scale aid directly at rural areas, where 70 percent of Zaire's 35 million people live. Most of the money is spent to solve the country's most acute problem, transport. ""This whole system puts limits on how far reform can go,"" said a western diplomat. ""You work with what you got."""23-Nov-87,NIGERIA (96%); AFRICA (95%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%);,"Through a car window, a Lagos ''go slow,'' or traffic jam, offers a snapshot of the diminished fortunes of Nigeria, the giant of black Africa. Five years ago, freeways here were clogged with cars bought during an oil boom. Today, traffic clogs behind cars that break down because owners cannot afford spare parts. Traffic also slows when the police set up checkpoints to look for armed robbers. Increasingly, newspapers say, these bandits come from the newly poor middle class. Some Peddle Their Wares Outside the car window, a ''go slow'' victim invariably encounters nimble young men peddling their wares to a captive market. Recent offerings ranged from videocassette tapes to bikini underwear. These are the hallmarks of Nigeria today - entrepreneurial hustle amid economic depression, a fraying social fabric amid a liberalizing political climate. With a gross national product larger than that of South Africa and a population that accounts for one in four black Africans, Nigeria has always played out African trends on a grand scale. As newly independent African countries suffered from instability, this West African nation was one of the shakiest, enduring six coups and three presidential assassinations since independence in 1960. As tribal pressures strained Africa's new nations, Nigeria was torn by the continent's most violent tribal conflict - the Biafra War of 1967 to 1970, in which about a million people died. As development became the new religion, Nigeria put its faith in oil, earning $100 billion in a decade. But oil prices crashed, and Nigeria found itself with a $21 billion foreign debt, an urban population dependent on foreign imports and a rural population that could no longer feed the nation. #2 Courses of Action ''The party was over,'' Remi Ilori, a Nigerian newspaper columnist, wrote recently. ''We awakened to the reality that we had spent colossal sums of money feasting. The tables had to be cleared - so many plates of unfinished food, so many empty bottles of beer.'' Nigeria has embarked on two courses that, once again, are being watched with interest across Africa. Both involve controlled liberalization - one in politics, the other in economics. On the political front, the President, Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, who was wounded in the Biafra War, announced plans last summer for a phased return to civilian rule by 1992. Determined to create ''a new political generation,'' the gregarious army general moved in September to ban virtually all former politicians from running for office. ''The basic idea is that Nigeria starts with a clean slate,'' said Ray Ekpu, the editor in chief of Newswatch, an independent weekly. The blanket ban met with little outcry from Nigerians. Widespread corruption marred two earlier experiences with civilian rule. A voter registration campaign in recent weeks met with so little interest that state governments threatened to withhold the salaries of civil servants who did not register. ''People still nurse the fear that politicians with their sugar-coated tongues will soon abandon them once voted into power,'' Jimoh Ojedele, a civil servant from Ibadan, said of the low turnout. The next events on the President's political calendar are local elections, which are to be held Dec. 12 on a non-party basis. These elections are to be followed by a constitutional convention, the formation of two political parties, state elections, a national census and a presidential election in 1992. ''It's going to be a rough five years for Babangida to get through,'' a senior Western diplomat here said. Some Nigerians, like Ola Balogun, a film maker, believe that Western-style democracy will not take root in an African society like Nigeria's. ''You are going to have the shadow, but not the substance,'' said Mr. Balogun, who resigned last spring from a board advising the President on Nigeria's political future. ''I think we have to fail a third time before we try something really different.'' Instead of Western-style political parties, Mr. Balogun suggested forming a parliament composed of representatives of groups that traditionally commanded respect in Africa - clans and professional guilds. Just How Many People Live in the Country? A major obstacle to creating a Western-style democracy here is expected to be the carrying out of a national census. Most estimates put the population at 105 million, but no one knows for sure. The last accepted census was in 1963. Two others were canceled because of charges of fraud. Counting heads bears directly on what may become the explosive issue in Nigeria in the late 1980's - religion. Although no one knows whether Nigeria has more Moslems or Christians, most heads of state since independence have been Moslem northerners. But recently, growing Islamic fundamentalism has strained Nigerian religious tolerance. Fundamentalist leaders have called for making Nigeria an Islamic state and for imposing sharia, or Islamic law, throughout the land. Last March, religious animosity boiled over in the north. Three mosques were desecrated and about 100 churches were burned. Stung by the destruction, Christian leaders are raising money to rebuild. ''The Christians are not going to pull out from the north,'' Anthony Olubunmi Okogie, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Lagos, vowed in an interview. ''If one hair of a Christian is plucked out, we will pluck out a Moslem hair. If care is not taken, there will be an eruption.'' Religious polarization, Nigerian commentators warn, could lead to a two-party system where one party represents the Moslem north and the other the Christian south. With the collapse of Nigeria's oil boom, the fundamentalists are believed to have increased their appeal. In early November, President Babangida threatened to silence radical religious leaders, warning, ''Religious bigotry and zealotism have not helped to provide answers to the failures of the past.'' The Facts of Life In Dollars and Cents The fate of General Babangida's political program is inextricably linked to the performance of his economic program. When he took power in a coup two years ago, Nigeria was, in the words of a recent Finance Ministry report, ''on the verge of external bankruptcy.'' Its credit sources had dried up. With the United States traditionally the largest buyer, oil has accounted for 95 percent of Nigeria's exports. But because of dropping energy prices, oil revenues fell from $25 billion in 1980 to $5.6 billion in 1986. At the same time, a million new people joined the labor pool each year. Many Nigerians and Westerners agreed that radical surgery was needed, but nationalist sentiment precluded turning to the International Monetary Fund. Instead, the Government ostentatiously rejected an I.M.F. loan, and then adopted a ''structural adjustment program'' that was far more radical that what the fund would probably have imposed. Fixed exchange rates were abolished and the value of the national currency, the naira, was allowed to float. It dropped from even parity with the dollar to the current rate of well over four to the dollar. Commodity marketing boards were abolished, allowing producer prices to rise. Production of cocoa, cotton and palm oil rebounded. ''The program is an impressive success,'' a European banker here said. As the devaluation suddenly put a true price on imported goods, middle-class Nigerians found that they could no longer afford foreign cars, shopping trips to London and university education in the United States. The next round of austerity is expected to cut deeper. Prices of gasoline, electricity, telephone service, rail travel and mail are to increase soon as Government subsidies are withdrawn. Few Nigerians deny that the present prices are low. A Nigerian pays 65 cents a minute to call London. A Briton pays $1.60 a minute to return the call. At 32 cents a gallon, gasoline here is one-tenth the price of gas in neighboring Chad. Indeed, gas stations near Nigeria's borders routinely sell three times as much as interior stations, oil industry officials say. With the cheapest jet fuel on the west coast of Africa, foreign jetliners never leave Lagos without filling up. Many Nigerians argue that bad service justifies keeping prices low. ''Lagos is roaring again,'' residents say, alluding to the noisy backyard generators that well-to-do residents fire up to cope with daily power cuts. The state power company is generating only 40 percent of capacity. Telephone service is among the worst in West Africa. Of 240,000 lines in this city of five million, 150,000 are working. Businessmen routinely resort to sending telexes or messengers to communicate across town. Although the World Bank plans to provide almost $1 billion in coming years to rehabilitate Nigerian telephone, power and water systems, the coming rate increases have prompted angry debates in the Nigeria's newspapers, among the liveliest in Africa. ''Nigeria's public utilities have a history of mind-boggling waste and inefficiency, overmanning and a corrupt bureaucracy,'' said an editorial in one daily, The Nigerian Tribune. ''In 27 years of independence, this country cannot boast reliable telephones, regular power supply, piped water.'' From the other side, another newspaper, Daily Sketch, inveighed: ''Our Structural Adjustment Program was dreamed up by foreign-based and -dominated financial institutions. Not a few Nigerians believe it is a ghastly nightmare.'' A Poor Climate For Foreign Investors A third part of the economic liberalization - foreign investment outside the oil sector - has yet to materialize. ''Unfortunately, no significant private investment, Nigerian or foreign, is yet in sight,'' Richard L. Kramer, the local director of Arthur Andersen & Company, said at a recent symposium in Lagos. ''The present Government inherited a negative foreign investment climate, which caused almost total lack of foreign investment during the entire past decade.'' According to the World Bank, Africa has the lowest rate of foreign investment of any area in the world. With its huge internal market, Nigeria should be magnet for foreign investment. But businessmen complain of a climate that scares away investors: a 50 percent limit on repatriation of profits, requirements of up to 80 percent Nigerian participation, a hostile and slow-moving bureaucracy, and poor utility service. ''You can talk to top Nigerian officials today who still think that Nigeria is an attractive place. They have no idea what it takes to bring in foreign investment,'' said an American businessman with several years' experience here. ''They have a center-of-the-universe mentality, but 100 million poor people is not a great market.'' Kalu I. Kalu, Nigeria's American-trained Planning Minister, said in an interview that the Government intended ''to create a climate conducive to foreign investment.'' But he added, ''There is always that scare: If we open up, we are going to be dominated by foreign capital.'' A 'Jerusalem' For Diaspora Blacks As Nigeria seeks to pull out of six years of unbroken economic decline, Nigerians are trying to resolve a basic psychological conflict - between the need to mesh smoothly with the rest of the world and their pride as the home to one out of five blacks in the world. Playing to Nigerians' self-image as the world's future black superpower, Bolaji Akinyemi, Nigeria's Foreign Minister, urged his countrymen earlier this year to develop a ''black bomb.'' ''Nigeria has a sacred responsibility to challenge the racial monopoly of nuclear weapons,'' he said. Since then, talk of developing a nuclear weapon has died down. Mr. Akinyemi recently relaxed in his official residence and outlined his view of Nigeria in the world. ''Some of us dream of Nigeria being to blacks in the diaspora what Jerusalem is to Jews in the diaspora,'' he said. He noted that Nigerian ambassadors - often the only representatives of black Africa in many world capitals -are instructed to reserve a third of their guest lists to ''blacks in the diaspora.'' ''We are acutely aware that if we make it in this country, it will shine on the image of the international black community,'' he said. ''If we fail, we will have dented very badly the image of the international black community.''"24-Apr-88,"AFRICA (97%); BOTSWANA (94%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (92%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); LIBERIA (79%); SOUTHERN AFRICA (79%);","On a continent where dictators who call themselves democrats routinely rig elections and jail their opponents, the following event actually took place: Kenneth Koma, leader of the Botswana opposition party, took the floor of the National Assembly to argue that the government's new budget was short-sighted and elitist. He spoke bluntly, barbed his words with sarcasm, pulled no punches. When he finished, there was none of the usual African shakedown. No one threatened, arrested or tortured Koma. He was not exiled to his home village, nor was he forced to flee the country. Government toadies did not question his patriotism or suggest he was serving ""foreign masters."" He was not harassed, ticketed or forced to pay bribes. His party was not banned. His remarks were even reported in local newspapers. The most punishing blow was struck when the minister of finance suggested that Koma should be more specific. Can this be Africa? Considering the 30-year devolution of democracy across much of this continent, something extraordinary has taken root in this desert nation in southern Africa. A multi-party democracy has been built here on the traditional values of a non-violent, moderate people who believe in speaking their piece. ""We have always tolerated dissent. It is something ingrained in our culture,"" said Botswana President Quett Masire in an interview. Political scientists who study modern Africa regard this government as honest, humane and responsive. To appreciate the oddity of an honest African government without civil strife that prides itself on tolerating dissent, one needs to look around at contemporary standards of democracy in sub-Saharan Africa. At last count, 38 of the 45 countries of the region were one-party or no-party states. The political norm is near-absolute power in the hands of someone who was never elected. Leadership usually changes when military coups kill or chase the big men out of the country. The Freedom House, a New York-based research organization, says Africa, along with the Middle East, has less democracy than anywhere else in the world. African states make frequent unflattering appearances in Amnesty International's annual list of governments that torture political enemies. Civil war, corruption and famine are endemic. By any measure, sub-Saharan Africa is the poorest region in the world. The most significant economic fact on the continent is that most countries that are marking their first quarter-century of self government have become poorer -- on a per-capita basis -- than they were at independence. Democracy's bleak record is easily seen by taking a look around at recent African elections: In Liberia, President Samuel K. Doe held an election in late 1985, lost it badly and then had the offending ballots burned. He later jailed his opponents. In Zaire, President Mobutu Sese Seko presides over uncontested elections in which he wins 99 percent of the vote. To insure power, Mobutu shuffles his ministers every few months -- between cabinet offices, exile and jail. To buy off challengers, Mobutu allows his ministers to pilfer government money. In Kenya, the secret ballot in primary elections was replaced last February with public queuing for candidates. Many voters were intimidated and scared off. As a result, several articulate government critics were squeezed out of parliament. No one dares run against President Daniel arap Moi. In Senegal, the reelection of President Abdou Diouf last March was followed by charges of fraud, riots and the arrest of the main opposition candidate. Sudan held a relatively fair and open election in 1986 but the results were rendered moot because half the country was cut off by civil war. The war continues and the country is still sawed in two by ethnic and religious hatred. ""Free-dom,"" was the rallying cry of Kwame Nkrumah, the school teacher cum liberator whose idealism and fiery rhetoric transformed the British colony of the Gold Coast into independent Ghana. For Africans under colonialism, most of whom had no property, money or position, Nkrumah's cry was a magical incantation, a call to war, a one-note song of salvation. Its justness was undeniable, its momentum all but inexorable. ""The wind of change is blowing through this continent,"" said British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in 1959, ""and whether we like it or not, this growth of national consciousness is a political fact."" By the late 1950s and early 1960s, most of the colonies of sub-Saharan Africa had become independent states. They rushed headlong into independence, following Nkrumah's dictum: ""Seek ye first the political kingdom and all else will follow."" Nearly 30 years later, it is painfully clear that ""all else"" -- democracy, honest government, prosperity, free speech -- does not follow. But independent Africa is still very young. Its institutions are changing and its people are racing to catch up with the developed world. Many political scientists see Africa as a unique laboratory for sorting out the economic and social factors that either foster or strangle democracy. ""Democracy in Africa is an experimental process in a new generation of countries,"" said political scientist Richard Sklar in a speech to the African Studies Association. ""We should study this process not only to learn about Africa, but also to refresh our knowledge about the meaning of democracy itself."" If the governor of the state of Iowa were to become a greedy dictator, jailing his critics without trial, helping himself to the state treasury, demanding that Iowans hang his picture in all public places and worship him as an infallible demigod, it is likely he would attract attention from specialists in the study of state government. By the same logic, Botswana, an island of democracy in a sea of dictatorship, intrigues specialists in African politics. This coming August an international conference will be held in Gaborone. It will conclude a ""Democracy Project"" that has been analyzing why a tolerant, responsive government has developed here. That research, along with the findings of political scientists who have worked across Africa, suggests three major factors that underlie the success of democracy here. The first is money. For a Texas-sized country with only one million people, Botswana has lots of money. Along with South Africa and the Soviet Union, it has the largest reserves of diamonds in the world. Its high-quality diamonds in the past decade have catapulted it from being one of Africa's poorest countries to one of its richest. According to government figures, per-capita income has increased more than five times in the past 10 years -- from $ 290 to $ 1,680 a year. Annual economic growth has averaged 12 percent. By African standards, these figures are astonishing. In the rest of the sub-Saharan region in that time, the average standard of living has fallen, according to the World Bank. Most Africans have become poorer. ""Liberal democracy founders in a rising tide of tears and social disrepair,"" notes Africanist Richard Sklar. ""People will not settle for redistribution of misery and poverty. Everything depends upon the timely creation of wealth and wealth-producing assets . . . ."" Botswana's money has allowed generous spending on programs that benefit the mass of the population. Close to half of government spending goes to development. Access to schools and health clinics has become a given, even in remote rural areas. During the severe seven-year drought that just ended, a government-financed relief project prevented any starvation and allowed only a slight increase in malnutrition. According to John Holm, a political scientist from Cleveland State University and the director of the Democracy Project here, what is particularly impressive about the government's use of its money is its concern for ""social justice."" Holm and several political leaders here note that Botswana is able to funnel its diamond money to the masses because of strong cultural links between government and society. In contrast, in Zaire, where African scholars refer to ""the government as predator,"" those links do not exist and billions of dollars in copper earnings have been funneled to private Swiss bank accounts. The second major factor that makes democracy work here is that the 22-year-old national government and the centuries-old Tswana tribal system have a lot in common. ""Traditional Tswana values of public discussion, community consensus, nonviolence and moderation are critical elements of a democratic political culture,"" says Holm. Quett Masire, the country's president, explains that ""Batswana are used to their type of democracy where every man is given an opportunity to have his say. It doesn't matter who he is, he can opine. At the end of the day, what seems sensible, no matter who said it, is taken as the resolution of the debate."" Nearly every village in Botswana has a local laboratory for democracy. Called the kgotla, it is a community meeting held in front of the chief's house. By tradition, chiefs did not make major decisions without listening to villagers at the kgotla and, if possible, finding a consensus. Holm says that the ruling Botswana Democratic Party ""has, if anything, amplified on this tradition in that government officials -- both civil servants and politicians -- discuss all new policies with the local community before any local implementation. They also seek to get a consensus behind their proposals. If one does not emerge, the program is likely to be reformulated or sometimes terminated."" Members of the National Assembly, who elect the country's president, travel thousands of miles a year attending kgotlas in their districts and listening to local grievances. Parliamentarians who don't travel, don't get re-elected, according to Holm. Smoothing the way for all this democracy is ethnic, linguistic and cultural homogeneity among the nine Tswana tribes. This is a luxury enjoyed by few African countries, many of whose boundaries have roped together mutually antagonistic tribes with differing languages and religions. The final factor that keeps democracy working in Botswana, according to Holm and local politicians, is honesty: It's government leaders have not stolen the store. ""For this system to work, the head of the government must behave in a way that earns respect. He must not do things that are shameful,"" says opposition leader Kenneth Koma, the man who is not and does not expect to be harassed when he criticizes the government. ""For the last 20 years, they -- the leaders -- have been behaving in a way that is worthy."" For all its democratic traditions, Botswana's class structure remains one of the most elitist in Africa. The people who run the government, the president and nearly every senior official, are wealthy cattle owners. Wealth in the country is distributed extremely unevenly. More than half the country's cattle -- the most important social measure of wealth -- are held by 5 percent of the population. Opinion surveys in Botswana for the Democracy Project have found that voters are exceptionally conservative and that they are made nervous by too much political conflict. About 40 percent of rural voters say they would prefer to return to the old chieftain system in which a chief, in the words of one African scholar, is ""at once ruler, judge, maker and guardian of the law . . . ."" According to Holm, modern democracy in Botswana, as led by a wealthy and paternalistic group of cattle owners, somehow has meshed with these conservative yearnings. ""The new political elite has taken over the traditional kgotla from the chiefs and allowed citizens to use it to voice local concerns,"" Holm says. Holm says what holds the hybrid system together is respect for the rule of law. As opposition leader Koma concedes, officials with power do not abuse it. ""This is one of the most law-abiding places in world,"" says Holm. ""If you are driving with a car full of Batswana and you make an illegal U-turn, everyone gets very quiet. They feel guilty for you."" Blaine Harden covers Africa for The Washington Post."23-May-88,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (96%); CENTRAL AFRICA (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); AFRICA (79%);","A drop of sweat slipped onto his brow, perhaps from the heat, perhaps from nervousness, as Nakambo explained how lucky he was to find a job as a private school teacher that pays $10 a week. ''If I were still teaching at a public school, I would be earning just three dollars a week,'' he said, leaning forward in an ocher-colored armchair in his small cinder-block house in the Cite district of Kinshasa, the capital. Ten dollars a week pays for no more than his rent and the two staples in his family's diet: corn and cassava. Yet Nakambo seems better off than most of the 35 million people in this huge Central African nation. At least he can sometimes purchase extras with whatever he earns teaching French to the children of diplomats. With Africa's largest expanse of forest, 13 percent of the world's hydroelectric capacity and huge mineral deposits, Zaire has immense potential. It also has a reputation as one of the world's most egregious examples of economic mismanagement. Formerly the Belgian Congo, Zaire was self-sufficient agriculturally when it became independent in 1960. It now imports over one-fourth its food. Per capita income in Zaire, which is the size of the United States east of the Mississippi, is just $180 a year, 10 percent of the 1960 level and the eighth lowest in the world. In parts of Kinshasa, the infant mortality rate is 20 percent. More than one-third of the nation's children die before the age of five. Economists, diplomats and Western businessmen ascribe these woes to a long list of factors: rampant corruption in the Government of President Mobutu Sese Seko, estimated by the State Department to be worth $5 billion himself; a failure to maintain roads and basic services; extravagant spending on grandiose projects; wide-scale capital flight by the nation's rich, and such external factors as low commodity prices and high interest rates. While President Mobutu, who seized power in 1965, gets high marks for having woven together a nation out of 200 often-feuding tribes, his economic leadership receives far lower grades. According to the World Bank, Zaire's per capita income fell by 3.9 percent a year from 1973 to 1985. Only war-torn Nicaragua did worse. A Society Mismanaged, Repressed and Corrupted ''The political repression is nothing compared with the economic incompetence,'' one Western business executive said. But many economists and Western diplomats note that because Zaire is a repressive, one-party state, Government leaders from the President on down have felt little pressure to improve the situation. Indeed, they enrich themselves from it. Some academic studies have found that only 40 percent of Government funds go to the projects for which they are targeted. Some business executives say 10 percent is a better estimate, with Government officials pocketing the rest. Corruption is so endemic that postal workers often refuse to deliver mail unless they receive a monthly bribe, while phone company employees have been known to disconnect customers' phones unless they receive their ''metabeesh.'' Zairian generals frequently keep their subordinates' pay, and as a result some soldiers shake down private citizens to avoid going hungry. Relatives of Government officials are said to be heavily involved in diamond and ivory smuggling. ''The corruption pattern starts at the very summit of the system,'' said Crawford Young, a University of Wisconsin professor and co-author of ''The Rise and Decline of the Zairian State.'' ''The extent of Zaire's corruption may not be unique, but it is a leading practitioner of the art.'' President Mobutu, whose father was a cook and whose mother was a hotel maid, has 11 homes in Zaire and reportedly owns a 16th-century castle in Spain, a 32-room palace in Switzerland, luxurious residences in Paris and on the French Riviera, and lavish homes in Belgium and the Ivory Coast. He often sends military planes to South Africa to pick up exotic plants and to South America to pick up sheep for his palace in Gbadolite, which has been dubbed ''Versailles in the jungle.'' When confronted with accusations of corruption, the 57-year-old Mr. Mobutu says he is a victim of disinformation and adds that the United States and other countries have corruption, too. ''Everyone is sitting here watching this country deteriorate rapidly,'' said one Western diplomat. ''The thing that needs to be pressed is corruption; but if you press too hard, then you start to destabilize things, and the Big Man doesn't want that.'' Mr. Mobutu has repeatedly blamed civil strife and such external factors as weak commodity prices for the the country's falling standard of living. Declining copper and coffee prices did, in fact, take a serious toll. So did the high interest rates of recent years, which significantly increased Zaire's payments on its now $7 billion foreign debt. Pain Without Gain: A Fling With the I.M.F. The economic situation and debt burden grew so serious that Zaire rescheduled its debt numerous times and repeatedly invited the International Monetary Fund to help manage its economy. In 1983, working with the I.M.F., Zaire slashed its budget deficit, brought down its inflation rate to 20 percent from 100 percent and devalued its currency. Zaire won praise for trying to put its economic house in order. But the measures could not bring instant success. Although price controls on farm goods were lifted to encourage production, for example, a lack of passable roads to ship their goods to market made it unwise for many farmers to plant larger crops. Other measures exacted a heavy toll. The Government laid off 40,000 teachers, slashing education spending to 8 percent of the budget from 24 percent. Wage increases for civil servants trailed far behind inflation, pushing them to seek bribes. ''There are the very rich and the very poor, and austerity plans certainly make things worse for the poor,'' said one banker. In late 1986, Zaire renounced its austerity program, asserting that the $500 million it repaid each year was too painful and was causing a net outflow of funds. Within months, the budget deficit skyrocketed and inflation was back to 100 percent. This decimated purchasing power: the currency, called the zaire, traded at 16 cents in 1983 but is worth a little more than half a cent today. The nation's rich deposited their money in European banks to prevent the emaciation of their holdings. As a result, domestic investment plummeted. Foreign investors were frightened off by inflation and the fact that they pay too high a share of taxes because Zairian businesses often bribe their way out of paying. After coming under heavy criticism from the West, Zaire agreed again last spring to follow an I.M.F. program, but only after winning more favorable repayment terms. Zairian officials and executives complain, however, that since they are plagued by low commodity prices their nation cannot regain economic momentum without substantial debt forgiveness. Today, whatever optimism economists and diplomats felt in 1985 has given way to a deep pessimism that it will take years before Zaire can creep meaningfully forward. There is one bright spot, in the view of many diplomats and foreign bankers: President Mobutu has named a respected economist, Sambwa Pida Mbagui, former head of the Bank of Zaire, to be Prime Minister. Many diplomats say President Mobutu, who often changes prime ministers every six months, has never had a man of such ability as prime minister. Nevertheless, one Western businessman, echoing the views of many others, said: ''If Sambwa really institutes reforms, he will step on so many toes that the high-level jackals will tear out his hide and he'll go down, too.'' An Economy Shorn Of Expertise Many of Zaire's economic woes began in 1973 when Mr. Mobutu launched ''Zairianization,'' under which European-owned businesses were seized and given to Zairians for token compensation. Many of the businesses went to the President's family and cronies, and within two years, Zaire's economy had shrunk by 15 percent. The new owners often had no idea how to manage their holdings. When President Mobutu was forced in 1975 to invite the Europeans back to run the businesses, there was often not much left to run. Another major cause of Zaire's debt burden was President Mobutu's ''edifice complex.'' In downtown Kinshasa, he built a steel-and-glass skyscraper, dubbed the World Trade Center, much of which remains empty. He ordered construction of the $250 million Maluku steel mill, even though Zaire has little iron ore. The mill closed soon after it opened when Zairian officials discovered that they could import steel for half the cost of producing it. The biggest project was a power line running 1,000 miles from the Inga Dam east to the vital Shaba region, whose copper and cobalt produce 60 percent of Zaire's export earnings. The power project was supposed to cost $200 million, but its final price tag, inflated by graft, approached $1 billion. The line was built even though many advisers said it would have cost less than $70 million to erect a new dam in Shaba, but Mr. Mobutu wanted the line so he could cut off all power to often-rebellious Shaba, once called Katanga, if it were to cause trouble again. ''The main obstacle to development is the state,'' said one Zairian political scientist. ''As long as we don't have democracy, we can't control investment projects like the Inga-Shaba line because there is no one to stop the Government from doing foolish things.'' Development experts say Zaire would have been far wiser to spend money to maintain the roads and promote agriculture. In that way it might have been able to remain self-sufficient in food and to reduce its heavy dependence on mining. Road maintenance has been so abysmal that the 1,100-mile drive from Zaire's Atlantic coast to its eastern border, which once took two days, now takes three weeks and is often impossible during the rainy season. ''Transportation is a very, very difficult problem,'' said Dennis Chandler, director of the United States Agency for International Development office in Zaire. ''There's not a whole lot of priority put on maintenance, and that's a weak link in a country this size.'' Sugar-Free Existence: The 'I-Get-By' Life When the teacher Nakambo was asked how he could pay for electricity and clothes, he responded: ''Je me debrouille.'' Probably the most popular phrase in French-speaking Zaire, it means, ''I get by, I manage, I improvise.'' In this nation of debrouillards, getting by means forgoing any number of niceties. If Nakambo could afford it, he would pay the 12 cents to take a bus to work, but instead he walks the four miles each way. Before the latest spurt in inflation, breakfast consisted of bread and sugared tea. ''Sugar we no longer buy. It's too much of a luxury,'' said Nakambo, who did not want his full name disclosed. His house differs little from tens of thousands of others in Kinshasa's endless Cite district: some thrown-together cinder block walls, a sheet of corrugated metal above, a few plaster partitions within. They create a dark, modest living space cluttered with a 20-year-old refrigerator, an old sewing machine, several chairs and a sofa. The eight-by-ten-foot windowless kitchen doubles as a bedroom for his five children. Nakambo's wife, Malaika, occasionally uses the sewing machine to make children's dolls in richly-colored African wraps, which she tries to sell to foreigners. She also used to sell ices to schoolchildren, putting sugared water into long, thin plastic sacks and freezing them. But she can no longer afford sugar and the refrigerator needs a new motor, which she says would cost about $100. While his family scrapes by, Nakambo's biggest fear is of serious illness. A few months ago, a cousin had to have her appendix removed. The operation and hospital stay cost $100, equal to three months' income for many Kinshasans. ''You have to pay off the guard just to be allowed into the hospital,'' Nakambo said. ''Then you have to pay off the nurses to make sure you're looked after. They have to survive too.''"25-Aug-88,SUDAN (96%); UNITED STATES (94%); AFRICA (94%); ETHIOPIA (93%); AFGHANISTAN (79%); SOMALIA (79%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%); ANGOLA (79%);,"As if civil war, a $12 billion debt, locusts and drought were not enough, the Sudan now finds its capital inundated by an overflowing Nile. In just two days this month, six times as much rain fell on Khartoum as in all of 1987. One and a half million Sudanese are now without shelter, food or clean water. A shaky Government, overwhelmed even by normal administrative tasks, has little hope of coping with this calamity. The fortunes of Africa's largest nation once seemed far brighter. In the 1970's, oil-rich Arab neighbors wanted to turn this bridge between black Africa and the Arab world into a breadbasket. As with other grand schemes in the Sudan, this one gave way to corruption, mismanagement and relentless ethnic strife. Nothing speaks more poignantly of the distance the Sudan has traveled from such high hopes than the fact that 300,000 Sudanese now seek refuge in the nation Westerners have come to identify with human misery - Ethiopia. No one factor caused the Sudan's many ills; no outsider can cure them. But one piece of the tragedy makes it especially hard to handle all the others: civil strife. War between a Moslem north and a mostly Christian and animist south takes $2 million a day from resources badly needed elsewhere. This pattern of civil strife and natural disaster recurs throughout the Horn of Africa. Ethiopia's civil wars have raged for 27 years. In Somalia, strife that re-ignited in May killed 10,000 in a month and sent 300,000 also streaming into Ethiopia. Internal differences create these conflicts; but all sides have their foreign backers, and superpower rivalries heighten the polarization. The U.S. and the Soviet Union are now encouraging belligerents in Afghanistan, Cambodia and Angola toward mediation and national reconciliation. That same message might help in the war-devastated Horn. Of course such talk is of no immediate use to the hungry. The Sudan's plight has deepened so quickly that most Americans are barely aware of it; emergency aid for flood victims is needed desperately. Additionally, this latest disaster might at last spur Washington toward an adequate commitment to sustainable development in Africa. A first step might be to honor overdue commitments to multilateral agencies like the World Bank that have already proven to be effective conduits for aid. As calamities recur in Africa, so does this refrain: The long-term solution is to help Africans become economically self-sufficient. With international cooperation spreading across the globe, it is possible to entertain fresh hope. Meanwhile, humanitarian relief is needed, and urgently."13-Oct-88,AFRICA (99%); KENYA (92%); UNITED STATES (79%);,"Post reporter Blaine Harden, writing from Nairobi last Saturday, said that Africa must share the blame for its own poor economic performance. Harden's analysis refers to the ""growing clamor over culpability in Africa's decline,"" and implies that the industrial nations should not be so ready to accept responsibility. He points out that government interference, inefficiency and corruption in Africa have discouraged foreign investors -- and reduced the very flow of resources the Africans claim is their due. Some of the clamor Harden refers to took place recently in New York, where the United Nations has been reviewing an international recovery effort designed to remedy the deteriorating economic situation in Africa. According to the Africans and the United Nations, things have gotten worse in the past two years, not better, because the industrial countries have failed to live up to their promises of more financial assistance to the African nations. The Africans maintain that they have performed on their side of the deal with the donor countries -- a deal made back in 1986 at a special session of the U.N. General Assembly -- by undertaking dangerous economic reforms. Conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank closed down inefficient government-run agricultural organizations and monopoly businesses and eliminated subsidies. Many Africans have lost their jobs as a result. Consumer prices have risen, especially in the politically volatile cities, where, in several countries, riots have broken out. Africans complain that the donor and creditor nations promised to find relief for Africa's foreign debt burden, but it continues to grow to the point where, in many cases, debt service payments exceed foreign assistance. And net resource flows from the industrial nations to Africa have actually declined since 1985, although they were slightly up last year. Thus, in spite of reform, Africa's per capita gross domestic product continues to fall. Part of the original 1986 understanding was that the Africans would not insist on bringing global debt relief plans and commodity pricing schemes into the recovery program, but would instead undertake reforms in return for a best-efforts promise by the industrial countries to increase foreign aid and deal effectively with debt on a case-by-case basis. Some Africans now want to go back to their demand for a global debt solution and a better deal on their commodity exports. In addition, many Africans want to do away with the strict conditions applied by the IMF and the World Bank, on the grounds that these donor-imposed economic reforms have unacceptable political consequences. Are the Africans right? Did we renege on our promises? Or are the Africans themselves as much to blame? The truth is that we did what we said we would do -- the best we could. It just hasn't been good enough. So, too, the Africans did what they said they would do -- engage in economic reform. It just hasn't worked as well as we all hoped it would. The fact is that we have slightly increased net resource flows to the continent, and a series of debt relief measures has been undertaken, ranging from the Baker plans, through the expanded lending by the Bank and the Fund to the proposals at the Toronto Summit. There is movement on the debt front, and the Africans should be pleased with the general direction, if not with the immediate results. Rhetoric aside, there does seem to be a building consensus on the kinds of next steps that both Africans and their industrial partners should take. Both agree that significantly more resources for economic growth must be liberated from the debt trap; after the U.S. election, progress might be made on this front. Both agree that concessional assistance should increase; the World Bank and Japan are the most likely sources. And no one will quarrel with the proposition that there is much the Africans themselves can do to improve the investment climate. More importantly, the beginnings of a consensus on conditionality and on the nature of economic reform seems to be in the making. Many believe that some of the economic reforms have tried to go too far too fast. We need to get back to basics in Africa -- more emphasis on fiscal integrity, mobilization of African resources for development, agricultural reform and -- to buffer political repercussions and address urgent social needs -- more spending on health, education and employment programs. These are the right directions. Let's stop blaming each other for less-than-perfect performance and get on with the economic recovery of Africa. The writer is a former deputy assistant secretary of state for African affairs."26-Apr-89,KENYA (95%); AFRICA (94%); UNITED STATES (92%); EASTERN AFRICA (92%);,"The Kenyan government has banned an aggressive business magazine that for two years broke an unwritten rule of journalism in black Africa. The Financial Review did not play it safe. It published detailed articles about alleged corruption and mismanagement at high levels in the Kenyan government. The weekly, with a circulation of about 15,000, named officials allegedly involved in illegal or unethical business practices. It focused on what the magazine's 36-year-old owner and editor, Peter Kareithi, described as ""very serious flaws in national economic management."" The banning order comes at a delicate time for the international image of Kenya, a poor, debt-burdened East African country whose economy is dependent on tourism and international aid. In Washington, the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa is marking up legislation that conditions future U.S. aid to Kenya on State Department certification that human rights -- including freedom of the press -- are respected. Proposed aid for next year totals $ 70 million. Pending low-interest loans and grants from the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Japan, totaling more than $ 380 million, are conditioned on Kenya's following through on promises for free-market economic reform. The reputation of this closest ally of the United States in East Africa has been impugned by well-documented reports of human rights abuses, including police torture of political dissidents. A prominent human rights lawyer, Gibson Kamau Kuria, who sued the government on behalf of torture victims, was detained for nine months and had his passport taken away. Last week, Rep. David Obey (D-Wis.), who chairs a House subcommittee on appropriations, vowed to cut off all aid to Kenya if Kuria was not given back his passport. In the Financial Review case, a minister of state for internal security, who works in the office of President Daniel arap Moi, released a document here Friday that said the magazine ""is declared to be a prohibited publication."" The document did not explain why. The banning order came three days after Attorney General Matthew Muli criticized the magazine for ""carrying mischievous stories implying that the government has taken over and nationalized"" the property of Kenya's wheat millers. Muli demanded an ""unconditional"" retraction and apology. Editor Kareithi said, ""Much as we wish to comply with your request for apology,"" the facts of the government's actions against the milling companies gave him ""difficulties"" in knowing how to do so. The story focused on sweeping new regulations published April 10 in the official Kenya Gazette. The regulations empower the government-owned grain board to commandeer private grain storage facilities ""at such times as the board may direct, and at such remuneration as the board may determine."" The Financial Review quoted several outraged milling company executives. One asked: ""What is the world coming to? How can a parastatal [government agency] which has never been known for its efficiency and which has been a constant source of misery to farmers be given such sweeping powers as to control the nerve center of the milling industry?"" Governmental protests last week against the magazine article did not dispute its facts. The minister for supplies and marketing, William ole Ntimama, said the article was ""written by people who have no interest of this country at heart."" The assistant minister for national guidance and political affairs, Shariff Nassir, said, ""Although there was press freedom in Kenya, editors should not be left to write whatever they wanted."" Kareithi bought the review for $ 37,000 in 1986. In an interview, he said, ""We must have known from the beginning what was going to happen, but we were encouraged by government statements about the responsible exercise of freedom of the press. We wanted to demonstrate that it was possible for a Kenyan-owned publication to take bold steps. We wanted to encourage other Kenyans."" Kareithi was picked up by police in December and interrogated for a day about stories that displeased the government. The editor said he apologized and returned to work. ""The past year has literally been a nightmare for me and my staff. When we sat to discuss a cover story, most of our discussions were not about how to get information, but rather how to report it objectively and honestly without getting in trouble,"" Kareithi said."2-Jul-89,"AFRICA (96%); UNITED STATES (95%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (94%); KENYA (92%); BURUNDI (92%); SOMALIA (92%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%); MOZAMBIQUE (79%); PALESTINIAN TERRITORY, OCCUPIED (79%); LIBERIA (79%); ASIA (79%); SUDAN (79%); CENTRAL AMERICA (68%);","THE issue of human rights was high on the agenda at meetings last week between President Bush and President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire. Mr. Mobutu rejects criticism of his rights record as interference, and he asserted last week that human rights conditions in his impoverished country had improved substantially. But members of Congress, led by Representative Ronald V. Dellums, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, have not allowed Mr. Mobutu to brush aside the criticism. While Mr. Mobutu was in Washington, the House of Representatives passed a foreign aid bill that explicitly links assistance to respect for human rights in Zaire and six other African countries: Burundi, Kenya, Liberia, Mozambique, Somalia and the Sudan. The newly assertive mood regarding human rights in Africa is in no small measure a result of efforts by black members of Congress. Having denounced South African apartheid, many Congressmen say they want to hold Mr. Mobutu and other black African leaders to an equally strict standard of human rights. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus maintain that their human rights advocacy is particularly effective. 'The Same Standard' ''We feel African nations need to be held to the same standard of human rights as any other nations,'' said Representative Donald M. Payne of New Jersey, a member of the caucus. ''The U.S. often has not been strong enough in expressing concern when African leaders have infringed human rights.'' Holly J. Burkhalter, the Washington director of Human Rights Watch, a private group, said that black members of Congress had taken the lead in criticizing persecution in such countries as Zaire, Somalia, Burundi and Kenya. The legislators have not focused on Africa alone, she added. ''They have been active on human rights issues in Central America, Asia and the occupied territories'' of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, she said. Mr. Dellums has introduced a bill that would cut off Zaire's military aid, which totals $3 million this year. It would also funnel economic aid to Zaire through private organizations, church groups and international bodies like the World Health Organization. ''It does not benefit the United States to be identified with such a corrupt and repressive regime,'' the bill says. Mr. Dellums's conclusion that ''political rights are not respected'' in Zaire echoes the State Department's finding in February that arbitrary arrest and torture were common. Since then, the department said last week, Mr. Mobutu has ''taken a number of steps to correct abuses.'' But State Department reports on Zaire generally substantiate Mr. Dellums's concerns and were another reason that President Bush raised the issue with Mr. Mobutu. Three committees of the House of Representatives have held hearings on human rights in Africa this year. Walter E. Fauntroy, the delegate from the District of Columbia, convened one such hearing to investigate whether the United States should oppose World Bank loans to Somalia because of evidence of political killings and the torture of prisoners there. In addition, the foreign aid bill the House passed last week says that in deciding whether to provide assistance to Burundi, the President should consider whether it has reversed ''patterns of ethnic discrimination against the majority Hutu.'' Burundi has reported that at least 5,000 people were killed last year in clashes between the Hutu and members of the minority Tutsi tribe, which dominates the Government. A Reduction in Aid The bill would allow no more than $3 million in military assistance for Zaire in the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. The Bush Administration had requested $9 million, but the Foreign Affairs Committee cut the request in view of what it said were ''widely acknowledged gross human rights violations.'' The State Department cited ''recurring'' reports of torture and arbitrary arrest in Somalia, and it noted that ''public expression of dissenting views'' is not allowed. Representative William H. Gray 3d, Democrat of Pennsylvania, has led Congressional efforts to put economic pressure on Ethiopia to stop violating human rights. He has proposed sanctions, including a ban on imports of Ethiopian coffee and a halt to new American investment and loans there. Ms. Burkhalter of Human Rights Watch said that African leaders often seemed to pay more attention to black members of Congress than to white lawmakers or to human rights groups. The criticism, she said, ''cannot be dismissed as racism.''"17-Dec-89,BENIN (96%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%); AFRICA (92%); FRANCE (90%);,"This was to have been a week of celebration in this sliver of West Africa as workers removed the cover protecting a new bronze statue of Lenin. As it happened, President Mathieu Kerekou unexpectedly chose last week to proclaim that Marxism-Leninism would no longer be the state ideology. The statue was unveiled anyhow, but not with the solemnity that Government officials thought the occasion deserved. Within hours of the President's announcement, several hundred demonstrators, some armed with clubs and hammers, converged on Lenin Square, burned the drapes covering the statue and tried to tear it down. Marchers then snaked through this old French colonial city, chanting slogans calling for the President's resignation. Similar demonstrations were reportedly held by several thousand people in Porto Novo, the capital city, Abomey and Ouidah. Though badly scarred, the statue here stands. But remaining uncertain is the future of Mr. Kerekou's 17-year-old military-installed Government, which Western diplomats here say appears in danger of collapse. Calm With an Edge For now, the decision by the authorities to crack down by imposing a ban on all public demonstrations ''until further notice'' seems to have quelled visible dissent. But on nearly every major thoroughfare, men in brown uniforms lugged automatic rifles and submachine guns. Moreover, the authorities are preparing for a possible new round of protests on Monday in Porto Novo when memorial services are held for former President Sourou Migan Apithy. Mr. Apithy, head of state from 1970 to 1972, was placed under house arrest after the 1972 military coup and released in 1981. He then went into exile in France, where he died on Dec. 3. Behind the protests is the dire condition of the economy of Benin, which changed its name from Dahomey in 1975. Those who took to the streets complained that Mr. Kerekou had not gone far enough with reforms. The Retreat From Marxism For several years, in fact, Mr. Kerekou has been retreating from efforts to fashion a doctrinaire Marxist state. Many unprofitable Government enterprises have been sold, and private financial institutions have opened. But Western diplomats and assistance officials here say that encouraging signs of economic liberalization have done little to reverse years of corruption and mismanagement. The state treasury is widely thought to be all but bankrupt. Indeed, earlier this year, the American Embassy's annual economic report - usually a diplomatically worded document - described conditions here this way: ''Since the early 1980's there has been a dramatic deterioration in Benin's economic performance, facing Benin's leaders with the worst economic crisis of the country's 27-year history.'' The Problems Since Independence When Benin gained independence after nearly a century of colonial rule by France, there were few predictions of prosperity or political stability. For one thing, this country - about the size of Pennsylvania and bordered by Nigeria on the east, Togo on the west and Burkina Faso and Niger on the north -has virtually no natural resources. The people of Benin were among the best educated in French colonial Africa, and before independence they worked as civil servants throughout the region. But between 1963 and 1972, the country endured 4 coups, 10 attempted coups, 12 Governments and 6 Constitutions. With such instability, economic activity stagnated, and by the time of the fifth takeover, by Mr. Kerekou, a young French paratrooper, poverty was widespread. Dramatic Shift in Mid-1970's In November 1974, President Kerekou decided that the country's 3.3 million people needed a Marxist revolution, and the Government nationalized several key companies, as well as banking and insurance services. But Benin's brand of Marxism-Leninism, while often repressive, had its accommodating side. Government ministers, including President Kerekou, fell over each other to greet Pope John Paul II during an African pilgrimage a few years ago. Much of the commercial enterprises remained in private, profit-making hands. And the French influence is still omnipresent; at the Sheraton Hotel, a business the Government controls, the truffles and camembert are flown from Paris, the wine is impressive by African standards and the lobby reverberates with the sounds of French Christmas carols. But for most people in Benin, life is full of aggravation and deprivation. In 1987 the gross national product was only $310 per person, as measured by the World Bank. This year, it is expected to be slightly lower. The Threat From the Left For now, Western diplomats say, the biggest threat to Mr. Kerekou's regime is not the youthful demonstrators who called for his resignation this week, but a small group of leftist extremists. The Communist Party was officially banned in the early years of the Kerekou regime. But in September, yielding to pressure from international donors to improve human rights here, President Kerekou granted a general amnesty for party members. By most accounts, the Communist Party's complaint with Mr. Kerekou is that he has not been tough and doctrinaire enough. Western diplomats say the party was a significant force behind the recent demonstrations."28-Dec-89,SOUTH AFRICA (97%);,"When South Africa created its black homelands and pushed four of them into nominal independence, it did not anticipate that they would hatch a maverick like Maj. Gen. Bantu Holomisa. General Holomisa took power in Transkei in a bloodless coup in December 1988 with a pledge to root out the corruption that became endemic under its previous leader, George Matanzima. Now the military ruler looks like a loose cannon on the deck of apartheid's ship of state. Within the last two months, the 34-year-old chief of the 4,000-member Transkei Defense Force has shattered the collaborationist image that caused Bantustan leaders to be held in disdain at home and overseas. And Pretoria can do little to muffle him without undercutting its position that Transkei is a sovereign nation. Transkei's radio station was the only one in South Africa to broadcast the mass rally near Soweto on Oct. 29 that welcomed home seven political prisoners prominent in the outlawed African National Congress. On Nov. 5, General Holomisa gave his approval to a politically charged funeral at home for the reburial of Sabata Dalindyebo, a tribal chief loyal to the Congress who died in exile after being deposed by the Matanzima regime. National Congress Rally On Nov. 26, General Holomisa authorized and himself attended Transkei's own rally on behalf of the African National Congress, at which Walter Sisulu and other released leaders spoke to a crowd of more than 70,000. The general suggested that the congress might some day open an office in Transkei. He has freed local political prisoners and lifted restrictions on some groups supporting the African National Congress. And there is an unconfirmed report that he secretly met its leader, Oliver Tambo, abroad. The country's 10 ethnic homelands were spawned by the Nationalist Government as a means to reduce the number of blacks living in South Africa on grounds that they belonged in their own tribal areas. Four such homelands -Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei - were declared independent, a status recognized only by South Africa and one another. The homelands depend almost totally on South Africa, providing migrant labor for its mines, factories and farms and collecting more than $2 billion a year in subsidies from Pretoria. General Holomisa suggested that Transkei's inhabitants might want to rejoin South Africa and, without consulting Pretoria, has invited political, civic and social groups to send representatives here on Feb. 7 to decide whether to hold a popular referendum on the issue. Responding to Changes In an interview, General Holomisa said he was only responding to the changes that President F. W. de Klerk, whom he will meet next month, had introduced in South Africa. ''The precedent was created in the very country that produced apartheid,'' the general said in an interview in his office in Umtata, Transkei's capital. But General Holomisa made clear that he was positioning his homeland to take advantage of a shift in the political wind by opening a dialogue with all parties, not least the African National Congress. ''If South Africa is changing course, I think it is for everybody to exploit and promote the situation,'' General Holomisa said. Phathekile Holomisa, an Umtata lawyer, said his brother's actions were consistent with the tradition of the Xhosas, the largest black ethnic group in South Africa after the Zulus. ''Chiefs generally listened to the people,'' said Mr. Holomisa, who inherited a Xhosa chieftainship. ''They were never dictators.'' He is regarded as closer to the African National Congress than the general and visited its headquarters in Lusaka last August with a delegation of traditional leaders from South Africa. First Independent Homeland ''I feel that most people are against the independence of the Transkei and regard themselves as part and parcel of South Africa,'' he said. Transkei, an area the size of Denmark bordering the Indian Ocean, was the first homeland to be made independent on Oct. 26, 1976. Last year, Pretoria gave Transkei about $350 million, or more than 40 percent of its annual budget. General Holomisa said 600,000 migrants out of a Transkei population of more than three million worked in South Africa. One reason why many blacks do not like to live in the homelands is that the standard of living and social services in the homelands remains much lower than in the rest of South Africa. ''We still have overcrowded hospitals,'' General Holomisa said. ''We still don't have enough to build schools.'' He complained that black neighbors like Mozambique and Lesotho, where the African National Congress was legal, were receiving economic help from South Africa, which wants to improve its standing on the continent. Pretoria's charity, he said, should begin in the homelands. 'A Sort of Raw Deal' ''They still pump billions of rands into neighboring countries which have not banned these organizations,'' General Holomisa said. ''We would like to operate like they are doing.'' Because Transkei was perceived abroad as a puppet state, he said, it suffered from the Western economic sanctions imposed on South Africa and could not get loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, while other African countries were eligible. ''We are being punished by this tag 'independent,' so we have been given a sort of raw deal,'' General Holomisa said. The Transkei leader recently legalized local branches of some anti-apartheid organizations restricted by the South African Government, including the United Democratic Front, the Azanian People's Organization and the Congress of South African Students. ''If South Africa is shifting the goal posts because it's no longer talking the Verwoerdian language,'' said General Holomisa, alluding to the late Prime Minister, Hendrick Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid, ''we'll shift our goalposts so we don't aim at the wrong target.'' A Non-Aggression Pact General Holomisa has yet to lift Transkei's own bans on the African National Congress or the Pan-Africanist Congress, a rival black liberation movement, though he suggested that he would do so eventually. And he said nationalist guerrillas could never operate out of Transkei, as they have from Zambia or Angola, because of a non-aggression pact imposed by South Africa. ''One of the reasons we couldn't unban the A.N.C. or the P.A.C. is we were afraid it might be hijacked and fall into the wrong hands,'' he said, referring to those who might undermine his regime. ''In Transkei, we need to identify who is who, otherwise it will get out of hand.'' The initial reaction in the Transkei to the idea of rejoining South Africa has been 70 percent favorable, the general said, though he would leave the decision on a referendum to the conference in February. ''Otherwise, they will accuse us of taking them at gunpoint,'' General Holomisa said, joking about his military rule. Mr. Holomisa, the general's brother, said he knew the South African Government was not happy with what was happening in Transkei, By contrast, Andrew Mlangeni, one of the political prisoners recently released by Mr. de Klerk, hailed General Holomisa at last month's rally as ''the spiritual brother'' of the congress's guerrilla wing Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation. General Holomisa seemed uncomfortable with the compliment when asked about it, but his tacit encouragement of the anti-apartheid movement seems to have increased his domestic popularity, already high because of his reputation for honesty and plain living. ''It gives people a feeling of not being excluded as part of a homeland, but being included as part of the struggle in the country,'' said Dr. Zola Dabula, a physician in Umtata who helped organize the rally for the African National Congress. ''Everybody wants to be seen to be allied with progressive structures.'' Seeks Supporting Role General Holomisa said the South African Government, the African National Congress and the Pan-Africanist Congress would still play the primary roles in determining the country's future. But Transkei and the other homelands, he said, should prepare for a supporting role. He has invited other homeland leaders to a meeting in Umtata on Jan. 22 and 23. ''Not everyone goes to the battle,'' General Holomisa said, citing a Xhosa proverb. ''There will always be old people and children to look after homes and cattle. When the warriors come back, they don't shun those people.''"10-Jan-90,"AFRICA (99%); UNITED STATES (95%); KENYA (93%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (93%); CANADA (92%); LATIN AMERICA (79%); GHANA (79%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (79%); FRANCE (78%); GERMANY (78%);","The United States today formally agreed to forgive all economic-assistance loans to Kenya, as part of an effort to give economic relief to Africa, including some of the continent's poorest countries.

The United States Ambassador here, Smith Hempstone, signed an agreement that covered $44.7 million of Kenya's total outstanding debt of $175 million. The remaining $130 million will be forgiven over the next two years, if Kenya adheres to an economic reform program reached with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

The per-capita incomes in those countries range from a low of $150 in Zaire to a high of $390 in Ghana. The debt forgiveness reflects continuing concern about declines in Africa's well-being. ''Over all, Africans are almost as poor today as they were 30 years ago,'' the World Bank said in a major report in November. Of the 44 countries of black Africa, more than half are severely in debt and have structurally weak economies, the World Bank said last month in an assessment of world debt. The economies are weak because of heavy dependence on volatile commodities, like coffee and tea, for exports; rapidly growing populations, and very little investment. Many of the economies have also been buckled by official corruption. Differs From Reagan Policy The decision to forgive the United States' debt is part of a policy adopted by the Bush Administration last year to do more to help the poorest countries. The Reagan Administration had refused to go along with some other Western nations, notably Britain, France, Canada and West Germany, which began canceling the official debts of sub-Saharan countries after an economic summit meeting in Toronto in 1988. The Reagan Administration chose instead to give the countries more time to pay. By the end of 1988, the foreign debt of sub-Saharan Africa was about $140 billion, the World Bank reported. In comparison with Latin America's debt of hundreds of millions of dollars, the sub-Saharan debt is relatively small. But unlike the Latin debt, much of which is owed to commercial banks, Africa's is mostly owed to governments and multilateral agencies like the World Bank. Economists have pointed out that the annual cost of servicing Africa's debt is about $12 billion. As poor as it is, Africa continues to be a net exporter of resources, paying more in debt service than the total of what it receives in foreign aid and earns from commodity exports, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. Don Harrison, deputy chief of the Planning Analysis and Research Division at the United States Agency for International Development, said that servicing the debt consumed much of the foreign exchange needed to purchase goods and services and supply investment capital for economic growth and development. Kenya Among the Better Off Of the 12 countries where Washington is forgiving its loans, Kenya is one of the most prosperous, with a per-capita income of $330. But even so, Western donors including the United States have expressed concern at the Kenyan Government's growing reliance on foreign aid to pay for spending and budget deficits. The donors have also informed the Kenyans that the Government is seeking too many large-scale commercial loans from abroad for items like aircraft for the national airline and a 60-story office tower. The United States is canceling its economic loans for countries including Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Malawi and Madagascar. Some of the loans, dating back 25 years, when Kenya obtained independence from Britain, were granted largely for spending on public works."31-Mar-90,"FRANCE (99%); AFRICA (98%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (94%); COTE D'IVOIRE (93%); GABON (92%); CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC (79%); EUROPE (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (79%); GERMANY (79%); SENEGAL (79%); NIGER (79%); ASIA (79%); CHAD (79%); EASTERN EUROPE (53%);","France is sending signals that it intends to reduce its role in its former possessions in sub-Saharan Africa and that it expects governments in those countries to move toward greater democracy and respect for human rights. Three decades after granting formal independence to its sub-Saharan African empire, France is trying to shed its image as an all-knowing, often generous and sometimes interfering Big Brother in favor of more distant and traditional diplomatic relations, according to officials and analysts. ""Now France is fundamentally getting rid of the colonies in favor of normal state-to-state relations,"" said a French official here. ""We still have historic responsibilities here and thus seek no sharp break."" In keeping with this new image, France was careful to appear no more than a concerned bystander when demonstrations and strikes recently swept through former colonies as economically, politically and geographically diverse as Gabon, Niger, Senegal and Ivory Coast. Although French troops still are stationed on African soil, they have been non-interventionist, unlike when they restored overthrown President Leon M'Ba in Gabon in 1964, deposed Emperor Bokassa in the Central African Republic in 1979 or helped stop foreign invasions of Chad and Zaire, the analysts said. Government corruption, human rights violations and economic mismanagement in its former colonies have helped weaken the close links that France maintained in these countries to boost its image as a world power and ensure the survival of French as an internationally important language. The policy, which critics called neo-colonialist, appears to have outlived its usefulness for the French, who long justified their hands-on approach by contrasting the benefits of convertible currency and law and order backed by French army garrisons to the economic disorder and violence elsewhere in Africa. Events in Eastern Europe and the prospect of German unification provided an additional rationale for shifting France's limited resources nearer to home -- or to Asia with its promise of better return on investment. French Prime Minister Michel Rocard has said that ""France has no moral right nor political intention to drop Africa,"" and other French officials have echoed his statement. They also have hinted that greater democracy -- and greater respect for law -- are overdue in France's former possessions in Africa. With African agricultural exports sagging and French business retrenching, leaders of these countries have few illusions about Paris's assurances that private investment will take the place of what was once the world's highest per capita aid program. That program brought with it tens of thousands of French officials, businessmen and technicians. With the passing of the Cold War, African leaders are less able to invoke China, Cuba, the Soviet Union or the United States as competitors to France for influence in Africa. In a recent op-ed article in the Paris newspaper Le Monde, a French African specialist criticized French officials for keeping silent about well-documented abuses in the former colonies ""for fear of endangering delicate bilateral relations."" He argued that French aid ""had reached the ultimate point of perversion"" by ""maintaining crazy regimes and parasitical structures"" that have become ""the surest obstacles to development."" France also has learned the usefulness of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. French officials have discovered that IMF demands for austerity measures can be conveniently invoked to refuse the appeals from African leaders for more funds that for three decades often were answered in Paris."12-Jun-90,UGANDA (99%); UNITED STATES (93%); ASIA (79%); AFRICA (79%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%);,"For sale or repossession: $1 billion worth of commercial buildings, tea and coffee plantations, residences. Location: war-battered African country, now rebuilding; World Bank favorite. Contact: scandal-ridden Government agency. On the face of it, the impoverished Ugandan Government, broke because of a sharp drop in coffee prices and the cost of trying to repair its economy, should be able to make a fortune from nearly 7,000 properties seized from Asian owners 18 years ago by Idi Amin. Indeed, the best buildings in the capital, Kampala, stand dilapidated and encrusted in dirt from war and neglect, awaiting either their old owners or new ones. But despite urging from the World Bank and the United States, both enthusiastic backers of President Yoweri Museveni, the Government's action to divest itself of the confiscated properties is proving extremely slow. The properties include virtually all of downtown Kampala, as well as potentially high-grade farms and tea plantations. All told, according to a Washington concern, the Privatization Center, which valued the properties on the basis of potential revenue, the real estate is worth $1 billion. Pride or Prosperity?  At stake in the Government's move to turn the property back to private hands, say Western donors and many senior Ugandan officials, is the recovery of this East African country. Without the rehabilitation of this property, these officials say, the engine of the economy will never get started. Yet for many Ugandans, there is something much deeper at stake: the reappearance of the dominant Asian trading class that ran the economy before the 1972 expulsion. About 80,000 Asians were expelled by General Amin because of what he called ''economic imperialism.'' Most of them were Indians, and they dominated the trading and economic life of Uganda, causing enormous resentment among the Africans not only because of their wealth but also because they were thought to have taken on the air of superiority. Since the expulsions, all the property owned by the Asians have been put in the hands of the Departed Asian Property Custodian Board, a Government body with no money to keep up buildings since fallen into disrepair, without water or working sewage systems. Many have been rented at low rates to political favorites. The Ugandan press has almost daily revelations about corruption at the board. Amid increasing scandal, the head of the board was recently forced out. Attracting Capitalists Ugandans in decision-making positions say they know that they have two choices. The first is to encourage the Asians to return and bring with them the capital and entrepreneurial skills the country lacks. About 100 Asian families are thought to want to return because they can see the money-making potential. The second choice for the Ugandans is to continue the current situation of making it extremely difficult, through red tape and bribes, for the Asians to come back. This would mean much slower economic growth but would insure that African Ugandans hold the upper hand, albeit in a tumbledown economy. Many Ugandans are said to look nervously toward neighboring Kenya, where they know about 70 percent of the economy is dominated by Asian families. Mr. Museveni's position on the confiscated properties is not clear. ''At first, Museveni was taking the position the all the properties should be distributed among all sectors of society and not to foreigners,'' said a Western official urging speedy divestiture. ''Where he is today, I don't know.'' Asian Ugandans who have come back from Britain, Canada or Australia also detect ambivalence from Mr. Museveni. Mumtaz Kassam, now a British-trained lawyer, was a 16-year-old schoolgirl when her Ugandan passport was torn up by Amin immigration officials in 1972. She has been working for the last few years to reclaim 45 properties that belonged to her parents and uncles. Effect on 'His People' ''I think Museveni is very sincere and has good intentions,'' said Miss Kassam, who met the President at a session of the Uganda Women Lawyers Association. ''But he also has reservations about the Asians, because a lot of his people will be hurt.'' For example, said Miss Kassam, who now practices law in London, the Third Deputy Prime Minister, Abubakar Mayanja, had been given the right to work a dairy farm that belonged to one of her uncles at the time of the expulsion. About 30,000 of the Asians living in Uganda chose to take Ugandan passports instead of British passports at the time of independence from Britain in 1962, only to be expelled 10 years later. As one of those who chose to be Ugandan, Miss Kassam feels that she and her parents and uncles - also Ugandan passport holders at the time - should be able to regain their properties. After nine years of trying to complete the task, first started by her uncle, Miss Kassam recently won back the family sock factory. She drove to the industrial area to look over the plant. It had been idle since 1972, but the machines, decrepit and partly broken, remained. An engineer was on his way from India. ''Uganda is currently importing all its socks,'' she said. ''We want to start making them here - starting with the army.'' She would like to remain in Uganda herself."13-Aug-90,KENYA (95%); UNITED STATES (92%);,"In an unusually broad attack on corruption, a prominent church leader charged Saturday that misuse of power for economic gain had become the norm among Government officials. The issue had until recently been treated rather gingerly in public. But the Archbishop of the Church Province of Kenya, the Rev. Manasses Kuria, told an Anglican congregation that the situation had become so bad that the ''organs of state machinery'' were seizing property from ordinary people. ''Unless God rescues Kenya, we shall sink,'' said the Archbishop, who until the last few months of political upheaval here had been reserved in his remarks about the Government. Corruption has become ''institutionalized,'' he said, echoing a complaint of foreign investors here. The Archbishop's admonition came as an Anglican bishop declared his financial wealth - mainly land acquired through a $32,000 loan from the church - and called on all public and church officials to do the same. Church leaders have been at the forefront of the campaign for a more open political system in Kenya. The country's President, Daniel arap Moi, is one of the few remaining major leaders south of the Sahara who still adamantly oppose a multiparty system. Three prominent politicians who called for a multiparty system have been detained without charges for more than a month. The crackdown in July attracted more international attention when Gibson Kamau Kuria, a human-rights lawyer representing two ministers who were detained, sought refuge in the United States Embassy here. Washington eventually negotiated his departure from the country. Four people have been charged with trying to bring down the Government. In court hearings last week, they complained of inhuman jail conditions. The Government freed four lawyers who had been held without charges. Churchmen, the one group of critics unscathed by the Moi Government's crackdown, are looking for ways to keep up the pressure on officials, people familiar with their strategy say. They have added a cleanup of Government corruption to the church's other political demands - the dissolution of Parliament, new elections with candidates from numerous political parties, and a limit on the number of terms allowed a president. Instead of opening the door to a multiparty political system, Mr. Moi appointed a commission to study possible reforms in Kenya's sole political party, the Kenya African National Union. The commission, headed by Vice President George Saitoti, has been traveling around the country to hear suggestions for change from party members as well as critics. Last week corruption became an open topic of discussion. At one session, a cabinet member and a local party chairman whose names were not disclosed were accused of taking thousands of acres of land for themselves. Reports of Property Seized Three residents of the Embu district told the commission that the minister and party officials had seized land that had been set aside for people without property by Kenya's former president, Jomo Kenyatta. Such outspokenness, especially before a public body, has been unusual in Kenya in recent years. The commission is to submit a draft proposal to Mr. Moi on possible reforms in the Kenya African National Union by Aug. 31. In another sign that the question of official corruption is coming to the fore, The Sunday Standard newspaper published a long article today on its investigations into land dealings by a former cabinet minister and two serving senior public servants. The World Bank and the United States Government have said that official corruption is hindering economic development here. The testimony and complaints to the commission have raised expectations. The question now is whether the limited reforms that the commission and Mr. Moi are expected to approve - the reintroduction of secret ballots in primary elections and an end to expulsions of members from the party -will satisfy the pressures for accountability and for an open political system."9-Dec-90,KENYA (95%); AFRICA (79%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%);,"IF YOU took a quarter-century worth of His Excellencies the African Leader and tossed them in a blender, you would come up with a Big Man like this: His face is on the money. His photograph hangs in every office in his realm. His ministers wear gold pins with tiny photographs of him on the lapels of their tailored pin-striped suits. He names streets, football stadiums, hospitals and universities after himself. He carries a silver-inlaid ivory mace or an ornately carved walking stick or fly whisk or a chiefly stool. He insists on being called ""doctor"" or ""conqueror"" or ""teacher"" or ""the big elephant"" or ""the number-one peasant"" or ""the wise old man"" or ""the national miracle"" or ""the most popular leader in the world."" His every pronouncement is reported on the front page. He sleeps with the wives and daughters of powerful men in the government. He shuffles ministers without warning, paralyzing policy decisions as he undercuts pretenders to his throne. He scapegoats minorities to shore up popular support. He bans all political parties except the one he controls. He rigs elections. He emasculates the courts. He cows the press. He stifles academia. He goes to church. Yet more than 150 leaders, many of them ""President for Life,"" have come and gone as the continent has been sucked downward in a spiral of declining per-capita food production and unpayable foreign debt, of civil war and rampant corruption. Africa was poorer at the end of the 1980s than it was when Big Men first usurped the authority of tribal chiefs and welded it to the power of the modern nation-state. At first blush, then, the reign of Daniel arap Moi in Kenya does not seem so destructive. After all, Kenya is an island of sanity in comparison to its East African neighbors, and Moi does not sanction the public mutilation of his enemies or write books about African utopia. Instead, he is a stolid, slow-speaking, not-very-bright Big Man who deftly uses the tools of his trade -- payoffs and coercion -- to stay in power. Yet it is precisely because of Kenya's success that Moi's rule has proved so pernicious. The logic of Moi's survival has been a recipe for national stagnation. His survival requires constant manipulation of the Big Man levers. His need to bleed the business community and grab all political power for himself is inversely proportional to his legitimacy. Since he comes from a tiny tribe, has little personal charisma, was never elected president and cannot reasonably expect to rule with the consent of the Kenyan majority, he needs larger and larger amounts of money to reward supporters, more and more power to silence enemies. According to the government's own press releases, Kenya must break its dependence on coffee, tea and tourism. There is no other palatable option. All the arable land is already planted. Game parks are severely overcrowded, and poaching has decimated elephant and rhino populations. But Kenya does have a competitive edge. It is well placed to become a manufacturing and service industry hub for East and Central Africa. It has the best port, the best roads, the best climate, the best work force, the best communications network, the best international reputation and the most vigorous free-market tradition in East Africa. To run with these advantages, the country desperately needs foreign and domestic investment. To compete internationally, the government has to reward efficiency rather than sycophancy. The law has to provide a level playing field for industry. These economic imperatives, which are the sine qua non of any country competing in the world marketplace, do not suit Moi's Big Man system. Wealth that Moi does not control is dissidence. Prosperity is far more destabilizing than stagnation. It should come as no surprise, then, that Kenya's economy -- outside of tourism, coffee and tea -- is dead in the water. Manufactured exports have declined in the 1980s and a parade of foreign manufacturers has pulled out. Almost no new ones have come in. Every year 150,000 young people flood into Kenya's job market. But industry generates only 3,000 new jobs a year. A diplomatic cable sent to Washington by the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi cited a pervasive pattern of ""favoritism as well as corruption in the Government of Kenya's treatment of the country's industries."" What grows is what Moi controls: government. In the first seven years of the 1980s, the number of government employees grew at an annual rate of 5.4 percent -- faster than the population, faster than the private sector, faster than the gross national product. It makes no economic sense. But it is perfectly consistent with Moi's need to buy loyalty. In the Moi years, an ethic of corruption has percolated deep into the civil service. In the mid-1980s, a friend of mine who works in the Finance Ministry told me with great pride that his mid-level civil servant colleagues were highly motivated and relatively honest. By the end of the decade, he despairingly said that ""every bureaucratic bottleneck is now presided over by somebody asking for money."" Kenya's descent into greed is by no means unique. Nor, by African standards, is it exceptionally venal. Yet Kenya is an African nation that has an opportunity not to unravel, and each day, as the population grows, as Moi's rot spreads, the window of opportunity closes. The future of 22 million Kenyans (in less than 20 years it will be 44 million) is being squandered to preserve one boring unelected president. The simplest cure for Big Man disease in Kenya, as across black Africa, would be Moi's replacement with a new, improved Big Man. If such a leader commanded personal authority he did not have to buy, if he were willing to operate within a framework of laws, if he exploited Kenya's potential for accelerated industrial growth, and if he was convinced of the need to resuscitate parliament and other decision-making bodies that allowed Kenyans to participate in their own governance, then the decline of Kenya could be turned around. On a trip to Ghana I asked military leader Jerry Rawlings -- who is a new and improved Big Man -- what is the best treatment for a slowly disintegrating country like Kenya. ""An enlightened dictator,"" he whispered. The dismal history of leadership in independent Africa, however, suggests that the odds are against Moi's successor being an enlightened despot, a philosopher king. Gibson Kamau Kuria, the gutsy Kenyan lawyer whom Moi jailed, vilified and this year forced into exile, told me again and again that Africans must learn not to place their future in the hands of a big chief, who may or may not turn out to be benevolent. Big Man disease, he said, can only be cured by vigorous institutions that limit individual power while increasing popular participation in government. To that end, Western governments and multilateral lending agencies may be able to play a supporting role in preserving or rebuilding Africa's democratic institutions. In that spirit, a top World Bank official recently urged the Kenyan government to do more to bring about democratic change. The power of the West to influence policy in poor African countries grew enormously in the 1980s. The poorer Africa became, the more it had to accept conditions on aid. Outsiders have become the architects of economic policy in much of black Africa. Kenya is particularly beholden to the West. The IMF demands devaluation of the Kenyan shilling and Kenya devalues. The choice is simple: reform or no loan money. For the time being, at least, Kenya has a legal tradition and democratic institutions. Both are wobbly, but they still exist. There are still large numbers of trained and committed people who believe in the rule of law and the usefulness of parliament. These individuals, however, are helpless in the face of Moi's one-man state, which is propped up by hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and tourist money. What they desperately need is for Western donors to insist on free elections in the same way that they insist on a rationally valued currency. The U.S. Congress acted properly when it voted recently to freeze $ 15 million in military aid, linking its resumption to political freedom. After an explosion of of international press criticism in 1987, Kenya's Big Man temporarily stopped his police from torturing people. He even stooped so low as to grant me -- a journalist whom he once described as ""serving foreign masters"" and using ""dirty words"" -- an interview. He did so for the sake of continued aid and to preserve an international reputation that keeps the tourists coming. Considering Moi's weak political base, his paranoia, and his boundless greed, my bet is that he also will stop stealing elections, bullying judges, and dismantling the constitution. That is, if he has no other way to get the money. Blaine Harden, Warsaw bureau chief for The Washington Post, previously was based in Nairobi.

The head of the republic's election commission said tonight that no official results would be reported until Tuesday. According to unofficial reports, the turnout among the two million eligible voters was high, as much as 80 percent in some places. The total population is about four million. A second round of voting will be held on March 24 if none of the 13 candidates receives more than 50 percent of the vote. Most political commentators believe that the Prime Minister, Nicephore Soglo, a former senior official of the World Bank who helped engineer Benin's transition from strict Marxist orthodoxy to a multiparty democracy, will almost certainly finish first. Mr. Soglo's backers won 11 of 64 seats in parliamentary elections last month. Mr. Soglo's main rival is Benin's current president, Mathieu Kerekou, a former military commander who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1972. In December 1989, yielding to rising popular discontent, Mr. Kerekou proclaimed that Marxism-Leninism would no longer be the state ideology. Two months later, a coalition led by Mr. Soglo effectively stripped Mr. Kerekou of his powers, although he was allowed to retain the title of president. Moves Toward Democracy Subsequently, Benin became the first nation on the continent to remodel its political system along the lines of the Western democracies. Since then, at least 12 other governments have taken steps toward pluralistic systems. If Mr. Kerekou should lose, he would be the first African president to be forced from power by an electoral defeat since independence movements began nearly 30 years ago. Although widely criticized throughout Benin for his years of raw autocratic rule, Mr. Kerekou has cast himself in the campaign as a candidate of experience and stability.  The former governing party, the People's Revolutionary Party of Benin, has spent freely and hinted that the military may reassert control if the election appears rigged. Riot policemen were deployed in large numbers outside polling stations in much of the country, but no violence was reported. Here in Porto Novo, Benin's capital, many people said they were grateful for Mr. Soglo's leading role in tranforming Benin into a multiparty democracy and were casting their votes for him. ""For 17 years during Kerekou's rule we lived as if we were in a box,"" said Julienne Sagbo outside a polling booth. ""Soglo helped us climb out of the box,"" she added."12-Mar-91,BENIN (95%); EUROPE (92%); AFRICA (92%); CANADA (79%); FRANCE (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%); GERMANY (79%); EASTERN EUROPE (67%);,"Early returns in Benin's presidential election suggested today that a runoff might be necessary between Prime Minister Nicephore Soglo, the front-runner, and the Marxist-Leninist President, Brig. Gen. Mathieu Kerekou, whose power was eclipsed more than a year ago but who made an unexpectedly strong showing in Sunday's voting. The incomplete returns showed Mr. Soglo receiving 36 percent of the vote and General Kerekou, 26 percent. A third candidate, Albert Tevoedjre, received 14 percent of ballots cast. Since no candidate appeared headed for a majority, a runoff between the two top candidates, which would be held March 24, appeared almost certain. Final results of Sunday's balloting are not expected until Tuesday. The vote here has been closely watched because it was supposed to mark the advance of democracy in a region more accustomed to autocratic, single-party rule. Opposition Surprised For that reason, the impressive showing by General Kerekou, 57 years old, who ran the country for nearly 18 years until February 1990, stunned many opposition leaders and their supporters. Some Western analysts said the results called into question the seriousness of Benin's quest for greater democratization. Voter turnout appeared to be heavy, early reports said. International observers from Canada, France, Germany and the United States said that the voting appeared to have been freely conducted, with no evidence of vote-rigging or intimidation. In his campaign, General Kerekou, who seized power in 1972, offered himself as the candidate of stability and experience. Mr. Soglo and the 12 other opposition candidates made the election largely a referendum on the President, portraying him as a discredited relic from Benin's authoritarian past. If he should lose in the runoffs, General Kerekou would become the first president on the African continent to be forced from power by an election defeat. This country of 4.4 million people, once a French colony, gained independence in 1960 as Dahomey. In 1975, it changed its name to Benin. Eastern Europe as Example Popular unrest, inspired in part by the upheaval in East European Communist countries, forced General Kerekou to give up power last year but not his title. Mr. Soglo, 56, a former World Bank official, then took over as Prime Minister of an interim Government. The preliminary election results displayed the enduring power of regional and ethnic loyalties in West Africa. As the early returns came in last night, General Kerekou established a strong lead based on his support in the mostly rural and agrarian northern interior, which is also the region dominated by his ethnic group, the Somba. But Mr. Soglo surged ahead late this morning, when the results from the coastal and southern regions, Benin's administrative and industrial centers, were reported. ""Many people voted for Kerekou,"" a Western diplomat said, ""merely because he was their chief for 18 years, and a great deal of respect and fealty goes with that position, no matter how he rules. They don't care whether it's a single-party or multi-party system; it's all the same to them."""11-Aug-91,KENYA (96%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%);,"The week before he was shot to death near his home in western Kenya last year, foreign minister Robert J. Ouko was preparing a confidential report for President Daniel arap Moi about a multimillion-dollar construction project in which a top Kenyan official allegedly demanded and received a $ 3 million bribe from an Italian contractor, a key witness has charged at an official public inquiry into Ouko's slaying. Dorothy Randiak, a sister and confidante of Ouko and one of the last people to see him before he was slain in February 1990, told the inquiry Friday that Ouko confided to her that Energy Minister Nicholas Biwott secretly had been given a 15 percent commission on a $ 20 million deal to complete construction of a long-stalled molasses plant in the western city of Kisumu. Ouko, a frequent critic of corruption in the Kenyan government, was described as livid over the alleged bribe and was writing a comprehensive and candid report about the project for Moi at the time of his murder, Randiak declared. She said she did not know what became of the report. No suspect has been arrested in the slaying. The six-month-old judicial inquiry has galvanized the attention of this tightly controlled East African nation, where public mention or discussion of high-level official corruption is virtually unheard of. The verbatim record of the inquiry is published each day in Kenya's three daily newspapers. Randiak's testimony came one day after she first linked Biwott to the case, charging that Ouko had claimed that ""talking about corruption in Kenya was the same as talking about Mr. Biwott."" Biwott's lawyers, protesting that Randiak's testimony amounted to hearsay and slander, attempted to prevent her from testifying this week. Their efforts were rejected. As a crowd listened raptly in the packed Kisumu town hall, Randiak claimed that enmity between Ouko and Biwott ran deep and stemmed chiefly from the latter's attempts to scuttle Ouko's efforts to complete the molasses plant, a decade-old project designed to employ hundreds of Kenyans in his home district. Ouko recommended to Moi that the contract to complete the plant be given to an Italian consortium, described by the envoy as ""credible"" and ""competent."" However, Randiak said, Ouko complained to her that every effort he made to finish the project was frustrated by Biwott, ""unless he was given a cut."" She said Ouko told her that Biwott had pressured the treasury and the Ministry of Industry to snub the Ouko-recommended group. Meanwhile, she charged, Biwott closed a separate deal with a different Italian firm, which paid Biwott a bribe. Biwott, who like Moi belongs to Kenya's minority Kalenjin tribe, is considered a shrewd businessman and powerful political associate of the president. Biwott's energy portfolio reportedly includes some of the most lucrative enterprises of the government. An influential member of the ruling party, Biwott is well-regarded by many ordinary Kenyans. But privately some Kenyans see Biwott as a preeminent symbol of questionable ethics in the Kenyan government. Ouko's death came shortly after Moi and several other Kenyan officials visited Washington to seek increased private investment here. Many foreign companies have pulled their investments out of Kenya in recent years, complaining that so many Kenyan government officials demand bribes that business is no longer feasible here. The Biwott controversy comes at a time when many international aid groups, led by the World Bank, are pointing to a lack of political and ethical accountability in African governments as a critical factor in the continent's free fall to economic ruin during the past 20 years. Biwott has not commented publicly on the charges raised in the judicial inquiry. How far the judicial inquiry will be allowed to proceed publicly by the Moi government remains to be seen. For now, in a country where public dissent and criticism of public officials is rarely tolerated, many observers are perhaps most impressed by the outspokenness of several witnesses so far."12-Nov-91,KENYA (98%); UNITED KINGDOM (97%);,"The Foreign Minister of Kenya, whose charred body was found in the bush 20 months ago, was murdered because he knew too much about high-level corruption in the Kenyan Government, the British detective in charge of the investigation into his death said today. The detective, John Troon, who was with Scotland Yard at the time of his investigation, told an official Government inquiry, ""I ascertained there was a corruption motive, and I explicitly say so."" Mr. Troon read excerpts to the inqui ry from the voluminous report he completed after investigating the death of the Foreign Minister, Robert Ouko. The report was never made public by the Kenyan Government. He is the star witness at the inquiry which has been sitting for more than six months. Help From Scotland Yard ""Allegations of corruption particularly against the BAK group of companies are important,"" Mr. Troon said, reading to the hushed crowd in Kisumu, the major town in western Kenya where the inquiry, headed by a judge, is taking place. Scotland Yard was asked by the Kenyan Government to investigate the death of Mr. Ouko, a popular Kenyan politician and internationally respected diplomat whose body was found near his home in western Kenya in February 1990. He had been shot in the head at close range with a single bullet. An earlier investigation by the Kenyan Government suggested that Mr. Ouko had committed suicide, a conclusion that was greeted with derision by many Kenyans, partly because the body had been burned. The Kenyan Government has not commented on Mr. Troon's testimony, which comes as the Kenyan Government faces increasing complaints by Western aid donors about corruption. Donors meeting in Paris on Nov. 25 under the auspices of the World Bank will decide the level of aid for Kenya next year. A number of them are expected to tell the Kenyans that there will be cutbacks because corruption is preventing the aid from reaching the people it is intended for. Both the British Government and the World Bank have said they have canceled plans to invest in the energy sector because the Minister of Energy, Nicholas Biwott, could not be held accountable. Ten days ago, Mr. Biwott was shifted from the Energy Ministry to the Ministry of Manufacturing in a Cabinet shake-up by President Daniel arap Moi that still appeared to leave Mr. Biwott, Mr. Moi's closest colleague in the Government, in a commanding position. Mr. Biwott was among a list of Kenyan ministers named at the Ouko inquiry last week by another British detective, Kenneth Lindsay, who said Mr. Biwott had demanded a 10 percent commission from a Swiss-based agricultural and industrial group, BAK. The company planned to renovate a molasses plant in Kenya, according to letters by a company director, Marianne Briner-Martens, that were read by Mr. Lindsay. Other officials demanded commissions from the company, Mr. Lindsay said. Among them was the Finance Minister, George Saitoti, who will lead the Kenyan delegation to the World Bank meeting. The demands for commissions on the work planned by BAK amounted to 50 percent of the cost of the project, according to the letters read by Mr. Lindsay. Affadavit by Brother Mr. Troon said today that during his investigation he had found out that Mr. Ouko seemed to be unusually troubled after returning to Kenya in February 1990 from a trip to Washington with Mr. Moi, Mr. Biwott and other Kenyan officials. The testimony today by Mr. Troon, who is expected to be on the stand for more than a week, seemed to give added credence to an affadavit sent to the commission by Mr. Ouko's brother but not admitted into evidence. The brother, Eston Barak Mbajah, who fled Kenya last year and now lives in the United States, said in the affadavit published in The London Observer two weeks ago that Mr. Ouko had quarreled with Mr. Biwott in Washington over the extent of corruption by senior Government officials. While in Washington, Mr. Moi had cautioned Mr. Ouko not to interfere, the affadavit said. On his return to Kenya, Mr. Ouko was told by Mr. Moi ""to go to his home in Koru and stay there until further notice,"" the affadavit said. Mr. Troon also said today that Mr. Ouko had been advised to take a rest at his home. Days later Mr. Ouko's body was found."25-Nov-91,KENYA (99%); AFRICA (94%); EUROPE (92%); UNITED STATES (92%); UNITED KINGDOM (92%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (90%); SOMALIA (79%); FRANCE (77%);,"On the eve of a meeting between Kenyan officials and donors of vital foreign aid, President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, one of Africa's most prominent remaining autocrats, is facing unparalleled pressures for political reform both at home and abroad. Domestically, an opposition newly emboldened by democratic movements elsewhere in Africa has seen its support grow visibly as it confronts the repression by the Moi Government. Internationally, growing disgust with the corrupt practices of the Government has led foreign benefactors to pull back, a development likely to pose great peril to Kenya's fragile economy and heighten discontent. Conditions for Aid On Monday in Paris, the Western donors and the World Bank will meet to decide the amount of aid they will grant Kenya next year. In the past week, the principal donors -- the European Community, Britain and the United States -- have shown rare cohesiveness in condemning Mr. Moi's clampdown on the opposition and have indicated that they are likely to condition aid on Mr. Moi's willingness to move toward political pluralism. Yet thus far Mr. Moi has refused to yield. While few predict that he will remain obdurate indefinitely, he has in the past proven tenacious and adroit in the face of political challenges. One of the arguments that Mr. Moi repeatedly uses to justify his one-party rule is that a multiparty system would degenerate into tribal warfare. There are three major tribes in Kenya -- the Kikuyu, the Luhya and the Luo. The 67-year-old, barrel-chested Mr. Moi is a member of one of the country's smaller tribes, the Kalenjin. ""We have been having ethnic groups all over,"" Mr. Moi said last month in a rare interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation. Tribes and Parties ""See what is happening in Somalia. It has 102 clans, which means you can have 102 parties. In Zaire, 265 parties to represent 265 tribes. You cannot really develop the country with such divisions."" But critics say that Mr. Moi exaggerates tribal divisions in Kenya by continually referring to his opponents as ""tribalists."" Kenyans who have worked closely with Mr. Moi describe him as ""paranoid"" about the possibility that Kenya's largest tribe, the Kikuyu, will unseat him and unravel his large, illegally gained fortune. In a veiled attack on Mr. Moi, Simon Nyachae, a former political colleague and head of the civil service until 1987, suggested in an advertisement in a Kenyan newspaper last week that recent violence between Mr. Moi's Kalenjin tribe and the Luo, Kenya's second-largest tribe, was deliberately fomented by the Government, a view held by many others. Mr. Nyachae is a member of the Kisii tribe. Many urban Kenyans, particularly those between 20 and 40 years old, say that tribalism is less pervasive in Kenyan society than it was 10 years ago. Advocates of a multiparty system also note that since no tribe has more than 25 percent of the population, there would be a need for coalitions in a democratic Government. Mr. Moi came to power through tribal politics. He was chosen in 1967 as Vice President by Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's first president and a Kikuyu. Coming from the Kalenjin, a pastoral people who inhabit the Rift Valley west of Nairobi, Mr. Moi was thought to provide Mr. Kenyatta a neutral screen against the tribal pressures of the Kikuyu and the Luo. Unlike Mr. Kenyatta's first vice president, the charismatic Oginga Odinga of the Luo tribe, Mr. Moi was a rather bland personality who posed no threat to Mr. Kenyatta. When Mr. Kenyatta died in 1978, Mr. Moi succeeded him. Many sophisticated Kenyans believed that he would not last long as President. But on coming to power, Mr. Moi adopted a high-profile populist style, travelling into rural areas and identifying himself with the ordinary people. At the same time, he organized the rapid promotion of his ethnic compatriots and he gradually stripped the Kikuyu, widely regarded as the entrepreneurial class, of their dominance in the Kenyan economy. In 1982, Mr. Moi appointed a longtime Kalenjin friend, Nicholas Biwott, to the job of Minister of Energy, giving him command over a large section of the Kenyan economy, including many big development projects involving foreign investors. Over recent months, Mr. Biwott became a liability Mr. Moi could no longer handle. Both American and British diplomats complained to the Moi Government about Mr. Biwott's personal profiteering from his job through kickbacks and expropriations. As the allegations of corruption against Mr. Biwott mounted, he was named by a British detective in testimony last week as one of two ""prime suspects"" in the February 1990 slaying of Foreign Minister Robert Ouko. Mr. Moi was forced to drop Mr. Biwott from the Cabinet. Opposition Parties Banned Mr. Moi survived a 1982 coup attempt staged by the Air Force and thereafter did all he could to consolidate his power. His first reaction was to ram through a constitutional amendment that made law what was already reality: a one-party state with his Kenya African National Union as the only legal party. ""I would like ministers, assistant ministers and others to sing like a parrot after me,"" Mr. Moi said in 1984. ""That is how we can progress."" In the 1988 parliamentary elections, Mr. Moi replaced the secret ballot with queuing, a voting system under which voters stand behind the picture of the candidate of their choice. Voter turnout was low -- largely because people were intimidated by the system of voting. Moi. While strengthening his political power and enhancing his personal wealth, Mr. Moi has left the Kenyan military relatively untouched. By African standards, the army is quite small -- about 20,000 for a population of 25 million -- and quite professional, Western military experts say. Recruitment is heaviest among Mr. Moi's Kalenjin tribe, but promotions appear to be largely based on merit, the experts say. How Mr. Moi is going to deal with the extraordinary pressures that are cascading in on him is not clear. His decision last week to arrest 12 opposition figures and to send riot police with tear gas and truncheons to stop several thousand people from reaching an opposition rally angered already disaffected Western donors and strengthened a disorganized opposition. The United States and Germany were further antagonized by the Kenyan Government's accusations that their embassies here had tried to take opposition leaders to the rally in embassy cars. Germany recalled its Ambassador. The American Ambassador, Smith Hempstone, called the allegations ""lies."" The current Foreign Minister, Wilson Ndolo Aya, , called the outspoken Mr. Hempstone a ""racist."" As the political atmosphere has become more charged, the economic situation continues to deteriorate. Rural farmers are complaining about inflation and openly blaming the Government. In the cities, unemployment ""is soon going to become a threatening problem of security,"" Mr. Nyachae warned. Last week, The Weekly Review, a magazine that has been supportive of Mr. Moi, talked about the need to ""manage change,"" a concept that it seemed to suggest was out of Mr. Moi's grasp."27-Nov-91,KENYA (95%); UNITED STATES (95%); AFRICA (92%); CANADA (79%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%); JAPAN (79%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%); FRANCE (73%); GERMANY (71%);,"The United States and other aid-donor nations told Kenya today to introduce political and economic reforms and improvements in human rights or face major cuts in aid in six months. The warning to the Government of President Daniel arap Moi, which has been widely accused of corruption and political repression, amounted to a rare, publicly acknowledged intervention by aid donors into the domestic political affairs of a developing nation. Governments and international lending institutions that give foreign aid usually link aid strictly to economic reforms, although political motivations are often seen behind aid programs. The talks took place as Mr. Moi came under growing political pressure, largely as a result of a public judicial inquiry into the 1990 slaying of Kenya's Foreign Minister, an opponent of corruption. As officials met here, Mr. Moi today ordered the arrest of two close associates who have been linked to the killing. However, Mr. Moi also suspended the public inquiry. [Page A9.] ""We sent a very strong message,"" said John R. Westley, a member of the American delegation and head of the Nairobi office of the Agency for International Development. ""I don't think it's ever happened before -- no performance, no money in certain areas."" The 12 donor governments, which include Britain, Canada, France, Germany and Japan, criticized what they called the Moi Government's misuse of public funds. They also called for respect for human rights and backed opposition demands for greater pluralism in the one-party state. The donor Governments said that while Kenya would continue to receive aid, they were refraining from their annual practice of making specific pledges of assistance. Instead, they imposed a stern, six-month probation period on the East African nation, linking full aid to reforms and improvements in human rights. $800 Million a Year Donor nations and international institutions like the World Bank have given Kenya about $800 million in development aid over each of the past two years -- a figure equal to perhaps a third of the Kenyan Government's annual budget, although not all aid counts as Government budget revenue. This fiscal year, Washington plans to grant $48 million in aid for agriculture and other economic programs, but American officials say that aid next year could be less that half that level unless reforms are forthcoming. Kenya has long been one of the largest recipients of aid in Africa south of the Sahara because in the past the former British colony was a bright spot for economic development and political freedom in Africa. But in recent months aid donors have reconsidered their aid to Kenya as repression has grown and economic policies have stumbled. Foreign aid is considered vital to the economically struggling country of 29 million people, which has one of the highest population growth rates in the world. In recent years the assistance has helped Kenya compensate for its chronically large external payments deficit, which in 1990 amounted to $476 million. Over the past month, the Moi Government has arrested top opposition figures and used guns and batons to break up a pro-democracy march. Mr. Moi and close associates of his in the Government are widely believed to have become wealthy men over the years. Arrest of Two Colleagues Two of Mr. Moi's closest associates, former Energy Minister Nicholas Biwott and and Hezekiah Oyugi, a former head of internal security, last week were publicly named in the Kenyan judicial inquiry as prime suspects in the slaying of Foreign Minister Robert Ouko, who was reportedly investigating high-level corruption. Toward the end of today's meeting, delegates learned that the two men were arrested today. In their communique, the donor nations said, ""Delegates underlined that good government is a prerequisite for equitable economic development and would therefore be a major factor influencing aid allocations."" With economic growth slowing and inflation climbing, the donor nations called for slashing the budget deficit, reforming the bloated civil service and privatizing many state enterprises. They also called on Nairobi to reduce capital flight and increase private sector confidence. Consultation in Six Months The donor nations said that in six months they would consult again about aid to Kenya. Several delegates said they were optimistic that President Moi, facing strong pressure at home and abroad, had finally become serious about political and economic reform. ""What Kenya's partners were saying was we would like Kenya to maintain its leadership position,"" said Callisto Madavo, director of the World Bank's Eastern Africa Department. ""We think that some of these issues that came up in the recent past could undermine that leadership. The donors are not walking away from Kenya. What the donors are saying is that a number of areas must be addressed."" Kenya's Vice President and Finance Minister, George Saitoti, said he was ""very much satisfied"" by the meeting, commenting that it was helpful to have a frank exchange between donor nations and Kenyan officials about its policies and problems. He also said that he was heartened that the donor nations said they would continue granting aid to his nation, even though they threatened cuts in aid. Mr. Saitoti is among the officials named in the Kenyan judicial inquiry as having demanded bribes from foreign companies seeking business in the country. At a news conference, Vice President Saitoti repeatedly asserted that his Government was serious about introducing a multi-party system and rooting out corruption. ""The basic point is Kenya is not opposed to transformation to a multiparty system,"" he said. Later he added that it was clear that the donors ""want us to speed up the reforms on the political front and economic front."""27-Nov-91,KENYA (97%); FRANCE (94%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%);,"Kenyan police today arrested a powerful former cabinet minister and an ex-security chief for questioning in the slaying last year of the country's popular foreign minister, and President Daniel arap Moi abruptly disbanded the independent commission that was investigating the slaying. The dramatic arrests, however, were not enough to persuade Kenya's main international aid donors to keep the country's badly needed foreign assistance flowing. At a meeting in Paris, the World Bank today suspended aid to Kenya for the next six months and warned Moi's government that any further support would be contingent on progress toward democracy and the eradication of corruption. After two days of meetings in Paris between Western financial officials and a Kenyan delegation to review aid requests for the coming year, the World Bank issued a declaration saying that ""levels of aid for Kenya depend on clear progress in implementing economic and social reform."" In Nairobi, the arrest of Nicholas Biwott, who was fired last week from his position as industry minister, and Hezekiah Oyugi, a former chief of internal security, marked the latest chapter in a bizarre case involving high-level corruption, a brutal killing and allegations of a government-wide coverup. Until Biwott was fired last week, after being named as a prime suspect in the murder, he had been considered one of the most politically and financially powerful men in Kenya. Three others also were arrested, including two provincial officials and a lawyer for Oyugi. None of the five had been formally charged, officials said tonight. The investigation into the February 1990 killing of foreign minister Robert Ouko has embroiled Moi's government in a growing political scandal, at a time when the ruling party already faces increasing pressures from democracy advocates at home and from Kenya's international aid donors abroad. The Ouko case has taken on soap opera dimensions in Kenya, with the three English-language newspapers printing daily transcripts of the proceedings. One newspaper, the Nation, printed a special afternoon edition to report today's arrests and Moi's move to disband the commission. The commission had become a serious source of embarrassment for the government as witnesses -- including retired Scotland Yard detective John Troon, who investigated the case -- testified to high-level corruption and the involvement of senior Kenyan officials in the slaying and coverup. Diplomats and pro-democracy opposition leaders said the arrests seemed aimed at assuaging key World Bank aid donors meeting this week in Paris, who had made political reforms and an end to high-level corruption two of their main demands for continuing economic assistance to Kenya. Ouko had been investigating government corruption at the time his body was found shot and burned in a field near his home in western Kenya. The unsolved case had come to symbolize for many the government's inability or unwillingness to tackle the problem of widespread graft. But shortly after the arrests were announced, the World Bank announced the suspension of Kenya's aid payments. Kenya's foreign aid is currently about $ 900 million, making it the country's main source of foreign exchange, well ahead of tourism receipts and revenues from coffee and tea exports. In its statement today, the World Bank said Western governments ""underlined the importance of the rule of law and respect for human rights, notably the basic freedoms of expression and assembly."" The Western countries refused to make commitments for any aid in 1992 but noted that Kenya's case would be reviewed in six months to see if any new reforms would merit the restoration of assistance. Western economists here said the aid cutoff is likely to have an immediate and dramatic impact because those funds constitute a major portion of the government's operating budget. In addition, Kenya owes its foreign creditors $ 5.4 billion, according to World Bank figures. In ordering the arrests, Moi also seemed to be trying to repair the damage to his government's credibility caused by Ouko's killing. One diplomat said the move might amount to a ""house cleaning"" attempt by Moi before he calls for new elections sometime next spring. Others said the president may have been trying to slow the momentum of the scandal. Opposition leaders quickly dismissed the arrests as a ""gimmick,"" saying Moi wanted to deflect attention from the fact that he was disbanding the investigating commission before its probe was complete. By closing down the commission and turning the matter over to the police, the critics said, Moi has guaranteed that the investigation will stop at Biwott and Oyugi and not reach higher into the embattled Kenyan government. ""The investigation has been hijacked,"" said the Rev. Timothy Njoya, a leader of the democracy movement here. ""We have no faith or confidence in the police."" Paul Muite, president of the Law Society of Kenya and another prominent opposition activist, said Moi should have left it to the commission to prosecute those suspected of involvement, since the police also were involved in the initial coverup. Just after Ouko's body was found, the police commissioner said it appeared to have been a suicide.

Beginning early Wednesday morning, nearly 700,000 census workers crisscrossed the West African nation, using everything from Land Rovers and horses to donkeys and canoes, in an effort to sketch what officials hope will be the first reliable statistical portrait of Nigeria in a four-day census ending Saturday. Almost since independence from Britain in 1960, population counting in this country has been a highly political and contentious matter because of the implications for the allocation of national revenue and for electoral representation. Disputed Census Figures Three times -- in 1962, 1963 and 1973 -- Nigeria has undertaken a nationwide census, but on the first two occasions the results were heatedly disputed and then changed by politicians, and the third time, simply nullified by the Government on the ground that the results in many areas appeared to have been inflated. The results of the head count are to be released in February, 10 months before a scheduled return to democratic rule after nine years of military government, the most recent round of rule by officers. If, as expected, the population exceeds 100 million, Nigeria will become one of the world's largest democracies. But if the census results are again widely disputed, it would be a severe blow to Gen. Ibrahim Babangida's tightly orchestrated timetable that is to lead to state and national elections at the end of 1992. Violence or evidence of pervasive corruption in the counting would be ammunition for those within the military who privately maintain that Nigeria is not yet suited for democracy. Failed Past Efforts Altogether, 11 times since since the 1860's, under the beginnings of British colonial rule, censuses have been tried here, and by all accounts, the efforts have ended in failure. ""Our past record is not something to be proud of,"" said Shehu Musa, chairman of the National Population Commission, citing the fraud, acrimony and violence that accompanied past efforts to count the population and led the government of the day to nullify the results. Indeed, during the census of 1973, there were widespread reports that census-takers had been beaten or even kidnapped on their rounds, that villagers had fled to the bush as enumerators approached, that town dwellers had rushed to their native villages to be counted there, and that enumerators had taken bribes to swell the total. Since then, it has become normal practice to make ""guesstimates"" of Nigeria's population. The United Nations Population Division estimated that the population was 95.7 milllion in the middle of 1985, growing at 3.4 percent a year, and that it had reached 105 million in the middle of 1988. The World Bank came up with a mid-1988 estimate of 110 million. By comparison, the Nigerian Government's estimate of the 1987 mid-year population was 112.3 million. The state with the highest population was Kano in the north, with a total of 11.5 million people, and the lowest was Cross River in the southeast, with 1.9 million. To help assure the reliability of the census this time, the Government has imposed a 7 A.M. to 7 P.M. curfew today and Thursday and shut its borders. It has also asked airlines to cancel or reschedule international flights to adhere to the curfew. All government offices, schools and businesses are also closed. A special tribunal has been set up to enforce the restrictions and offenders could be fined, jailed for up to six months, or both. The Government has pledged that the information will be used only for the census and that Nigerians' privacy will be preserved. In addition, nearly a million people were mobilized over the last few weeks to go around and urge people to take part and to tell the truth. 'Don't Leave Your House' Slogans on posters urge, for example, ""Don't be counted more than once,"" ""Don't leave your house"" and ""Don't quarrel with enumerators."" Another poster pleads, in pidgin English, for citizens to cooperate: ""No lie-lie for all the questions wey dem go ask."" Also because of official concern about potential evasiveness, all residents will have their thumbnails marked with ink, which in theory will remain indelible for five days to prevent counting any individual more than once. Perhaps most significant, the census form, which is printed in red ink on paper half as large as a newspaper page, contains no questions regarding religion or ethnic origin -- questions that in the past have provoked bitter debate as various groups jostled for ascendancy. Censuses conducted before independence from Britain in 1960 were plagued mainly by counters' inability to travel to remote regions, some in sparsely populated parts of the north.  Some groups also resisted because they feared that it was a bad omen to be counted, or suspected that the British might use the census to collect poll taxes or draft them into the army."3-Dec-91,KENYA (97%); AFRICA (94%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%); ZAMBIA (79%);,"Under intense international and domestic pressure to liberalize Kenya's tightly controlled political system, leaders of the ruling party agreed today to give up its constitutional monopoly on power and follow an Africa-wide trend toward multi-party elections. President Daniel arap Moi, one of the last holdouts among Africa's political ""big men,"" made the recommendation for a switch to multi-party politics at a hastily called meeting of the governing board of his Kenya African National Union party. District and regional representatives must still approve the change at a separate meeting on Tuesday, but their consent is considered a foregone conclusion. Today's decision came after ""a lively discussion"" among the party's leadership, according to a government source close to Moi, who chaired the session. The source said most of the party leaders who spoke out voiced a preference for the single-party system because of Kenya's post-independence history of parties dividing along tribal lines. ""But they said if more parties are to come, we are ready to fight it out in the next election,"" the source said. The decision to allow multi-party politics marks a dramatic reversal for Moi, who only weeks ago was warning that more pluralism would plunge this relatively peaceful East African nation into the kind of factionalism and tribal bloodletting that has beset many of Kenya's neighbors. But with pressure mounting from democrats at home and aid donors abroad, Moi has shifted his position in recent days, first announcing that multi-party politics would come ""in two to three years"" and then revising that to ""soon."" Today's change comes after events that included a Nov. 16 rally for democracy that was violently dispersed; a presidential inquiry into the murder of a popular foreign minister that produced charges of high-level intrigue and corruption; the firing and later arrest of a powerful cabinet minister close to Moi in connection with the murder; and the decision of the World Bank last week to suspend all assistance to this aid-dependent country for six months coupled with a demand for progress on democratizing the political system and curbing widespread graft. In making the shift, Moi appears to be meeting at least one of the demands of the donors in time for the six-month deadline governing resumption of aid. But in trying to dictate the nature and pace of change here, Moi also appeared to be attempting to avoid the fate of Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, one of the founding fathers of African independence, who was roundly trounced last October in an election that he only reluctantly had agreed to hold. The party leaders made no specific mention of when elections might be held here, but analysts predicted Moi will opt for early next year in an effort to leave the opposition little time to organize. The government source also said he expected elections within a few months. Most opposition leaders reacted cautiously, saying they want a national convention to rewrite Kenya's constitution before elections while criticizing Moi for trying to manipulate the timing of the shift. ""If you want elections in three months, is it really fair to those who are trying to organize?"" asked Martin Shikuku, a former member of the National Assembly and a founder of the broad-based Forum for the Restoration of Democracy. ""It takes time to organize. It takes time to become known."" Shikuku said his group will insist on the convention and, among other things, will want it to set limits on the presidential term of office, repeal laws inhibiting freedom of assembly and political organization and outlaw detention without trial, which has often been used to harass the opposition. The opposition is already showing signs of splintering. While the forum's leaders have said they want to transform their pressure group into a political party advocating free-market principles, a separate group of lawyers among the opposition has said it plans to form a party consisting of legal scholars and academics and excluding those, like Shikuku, who are old-time politicians with past links to the government. Makau Matua, a prominent exile now with a human rights project at Harvard University's law school, said in a telephone interview, ""If the government agrees to a national conference, we will be there to participate."" Matua, who left Kenya a decade ago, said, ""the country needs a political, moral, economic and generational change"" but that with some of the current opposition leaders ""there is a possibility of recycling the same leadership."" ""I expect a split to develop"" in the opposition, Matua said. ""I expect for people to split along ideological lines, along generational lines, along the lines of those who serve in government and those who never served in government."" He said it would be ""a mistake"" for the opposition inside Kenya to resent the exiles expected to return now since ""we spoke for the movement when the movement had no voice inside the country."""9-Dec-91,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (95%); UNITED STATES (93%); EUROPE (92%); CENTRAL AFRICA (92%);","The newest Prime Minister of this Central African country said today that the Zairian economy faced imminent bankruptcy and that the situation was not likely to improve until President Mobutu Sese Seko was removed from office. On the eve of a visit to the United States and several European capitals, the Prime Minister, Nguza Karl-i-Bond, who was appointed Prime Minister by General Mobutu two weeks ago, also said he would ask Western donors, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, to virtually take over the management of Zaire's central bank. Given the widespread corruption and mismanagement in the country, he said, leaders, including himself, were incapable of preventing the economy's spinning out of control. ""I'm not a fool, the system is such that I cannot control all these things from this desk,"" Mr. Nguza said during an hourlong interview in his office here. Thus, he said he would call on Western donors to send financial experts to work with Zairians and help bring some order to this impoverished and debt-burdened nation. Steady Loss of Aid The move would be the first in what could be a lengthy diplomatic process that Zairian officials hope will bring this country renewed respectability among international donors. The United States cut off all development aid to Zaire in June because it was more than a year in arrears on debt payments. And last week, Zaire was to have been expelled from the International Monetary Fund because of its failure to pay its debts. Mr. Nguza said, however, that because of his personal intervention, officials of the fund agreed to postpone formal action until at least February, giving the Prime Minister time to draft an economic rehabilitation program. Mr. Nguza also said the wave of street disorders that recently erupted here could easily re-occur. The rioting and looting was led by disgruntled soldiers who had not been paid for several months. Zaire, with more than 38 million people, is facing a ""stomach revolution,"" Mr. Nguza said, adding that unless the country receives an immediate infusion of humanitarian aid, ""the stomach revolution will be fatal to the democratic process."" Hunger and Democracy ""My belief,"" he said, ""is that when people are starving, they are not free. You're free only when you eat, and not in need of vital necessities. And when people are starving, you cannot bring them to understand or follow you when you're talking about democracy."" Mr. Nguza's remarks came before the start today of a long-delayed conference on the nation's political future. Opposition leaders have said they hope to use the forum to either force General Mobutu to resign or strip him of most presidential powers. The Prime Minister is a longtime diplomat and official in Mobutu administrations. Among other things, he has served as Foreign Minister and briefly before as Prime Minister. But under General Mobutu's skillful system of politics -- allowing no one to gain enough standing to be in a position to succeed or oust him -- he has also been condemned to death and, at another point, sentenced to life imprisonment. With this history, he has no reason for gratitude toward the President and identifies himself as an opposition Prime Minister. Even so, the strength of his statement today was surprising. He agreed that it was imperative that General Mobutu be removed from office, but he emphasized that the transition to a multiparty democracy must occur peacefully. By comparison, Mr. Nguza cited recent events in Togo, the West African country where soldiers, seeking to return to power the former military dictator, Gen. Gnassingbe Eyadema, attacked the presidential palace of the reformist civilian Government with tanks and rockets. ""I wouldn't like to have to see tanks here around this office,"" Mr. Nguza remarked, ""and have them say, 'You're not going to leave here unless you resign,' and things like that. It's not that I'm afraid, but if we can do it otherwise, why not?"" Asked if he believed that President Mobutu was genuinely committed to democratic change, he prefaced his remarks by saying: ""I have to be careful as Prime Minister,"" and then he responded, indirectly: ""You have an expression in English, 'You don't teach an old dog new tricks. ' "" When Mr. Nguza served as Prime Minister for eight months in 1980, he decided that he could not govern as long as President Mobutu personally controlled all major institutions. He resigned and fled to Belgium. According to news reports at the time, Mr. Nguza accused Mr. Mobutu of skimming off millions of dollars from the central bank, the nationalized Gecamines Mining Company and the Sozacom Mineral Export Company, undermining a program of economic and financial changes. While in Brussels, Mr. Nguza became the leading figure in a loose-knit coalition of opposition groups, and remained abroad until June 1985, after getting assurances that it would be safe to return. Forms Opposition Then in a move that even some of his longtime supporters still find inexplicable, he accepted an offer by General Mobutu to serve as Zaire's Ambassador to the United States. Since then, he has again broken ranks with the Zairian leader, formed an opposition party, the Federal Union of Independent Republicans, and in recent months become one of the President's harshest critics. His decision to rejoin the Mobutu Government as Prime Minister, however, has rekindled suspicions that he is essentially an opportunist, willing to lean whichever way the political winds seem most favorable. Asked how it felt being called a ""traitor"" by some of his former colleagues in the opposition, Mr. Nguza replied that he had nothing to apologize for, because he remained steadfastly opposed to Mobutu rule."23-Feb-92,AFRICA (92%); GHANA (79%); INDIA (79%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%); ZAMBIA (79%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%); ASIA (79%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%); SOUTHERN ASIA,"NEARLY half a century after colonial empires began to crumble and dozens of new countries were born with high hopes of ending dependency and deprivation, a significant number of those nations have seen growth stall and desperate poverty grow instead. Billions of aid dollars and armies of experts later, international lending and development organizations, with thinning resources for the post-cold-war world, are tackling the blunt question: Why do some countries fail? The answer, more often than not, is bad government -- in its broadest sense. And as a result of a lot of rethinking in an age of scarcity, aid is getting a new look in both content and methods of delivery. In voluntary organizations, think tanks, national aid agencies and the World Bank, experts say with increasing frequency that technical assistance and sound economic prescriptions are just not enough in many countries, even if they are rich in natural resources. The United Nations Development Program, which will publish its third Human Development Report in April, says that more than one-fifth of the world's people have no access to safe water or basic health care; 14 million children die every year before the age of 5, mostly from preventable disease, and more than a billion people go hungry every day. Two regions account for much of the misery: South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, where literacy is low, population growth high, local government weak and education minimal, often because of national policy priorities. In such areas, where industrial nations and the former Soviet bloc once rushed in to compete at building dams, roads, bridges and steel mills, the emphasis is shifting to developing people, their institutions and the public policies of their leaders. The catch phrase is ""good governance."" Without it, experts say, aid is often wasted. ""The relatively good growth performances of the developing countries between 1965 and 1980 helped conceal the deep-seated problems of governance, which affected the efficient use of resources, and retarded adjustment efforts to respond to a changing external environment,"" said an internal World Bank study titled ""Managing Development: The Governance Dimension."" After 1980, it said, ""it was becoming increasingly clear that investment lending could not achieve its objectives in the absence of an appropriate policy environment."" In Britain, Lynda Chalker, Minister for Overseas Development, said an emphasis on good governance has meant ""shifting substantial amounts of British aid to training for the judiciary, the police, the civil service."" Her ministry supports establishing local governments in Zambia, civil service reform in Ghana, public service training in India and courses for judges in East Africa. Fighting Corruption ""Corruption, for example, has always been a problem in the developing world,"" Mrs. Chalker said in an interview from London. ""You will only get the better of corruption with open and accountable systems."" The misuse of assistance or the skimming off of aid by corrupt officials -- tolerated during the cold war when the loyalty of allies was often rewarded in grants -- can also be curtailed by channeling money not through governments but through private organizations, another new trend in international aid. Ms. Chalker said that in Britain, the money allocated to private organizations for delivery to the developing world has grown from $5.2 million to $40 million in five years. The United States Agency for International Development, which pioneered the funneling of aid through nongovernmental or voluntary organizations, says that a substantial part of its annual spending of $7.5 billion is now channeled through nongovernmental organizations or the private sector. The agency has also brought the American private business sector into a range of programs intended to help establish free-market economies not only in the poorer countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, but also in the former Soviet republics. ""Nongovernmental organizations are not only watchdogs, but also some of the best deliverers of assistance,"" Mrs. Chalker said. ""Oxfam can do excellent water engineering. The British Red Cross delivers health care. They are close to the people on the ground."" Barber B. Conable Jr., who before retiring as president of the World Bank last year set in motion the study of good governance issues at the institution, described nongovernmental organizations as ""eyes and ears"" that big organizations can use to monitor aid. It is fortunate, he said in an interview, that the number of nongovernmental groups is growing in the third world. They ""are teaching people to take their destiny in their own hands, one of the most important steps to democracy,"" he said. Dozens of American organizations, public and private, are being drawn into aid projects intended to contribute to the building of a whole society, not merely its economy. In Washington, the National Democratic Institute, an arm of the Democratic Party, has been helping a newly appointed Liberian election commission plan for free and fair voting. The private National Peace Foundation, also based here, has been advising governments from Nicaragua to Armenia on how to make compromises in order to resolve conflicts. In San Francisco, the Asia Foundation is studying how to assist the Asian press in strengthening democracy. Other organizations offer assistance in consumer rights and environmental issues, both of urgent importance in many developing nations. At the United Nations Development Program, where a Human Freedom Index is now being compiled annually, big projects are being discouraged and governments are being told, Why not a dozen village clinics instead of another showcase urban hospital? Nations are being advised by nearly all major lenders and donors to curtail government spending on the military and to expand protection for human rights and civil liberties. ""Fashions in the past were to try to do as countries themselves wanted without looking further ahead at the whole world economic scene in which countries were linked together,"" Mrs. Chalker said. ""Now the need for sound economic order and democratic rule is accepted everywhere."""29-Mar-92,KENYA (99%); UNITED STATES (93%); AFRICA (93%);,"In the last few days, many Kenyans -- as well as the foreign donors who have sunk billions of dollars of aid into Kenya -- have expressed concern that one of the few African countries with a relatively strong economy and capitalist economic practices may be in danger of unraveling. Over the last year or so, a series of events have contributed to a feeling of uncertainty in Kenya, which Washington until recently considered one of its strongest allies in Africa. These events have included widespread charges of Government corruption that have brought halts or cuts in the flow of foreign aid upon which Kenya's economy depends, and protests against the Government of President Daniel arap Moi that resulted in police attacks on demonstrators early this month. The latest events to shake the nation, an outburst of ethnic violence that claimed 60 lives over three weeks this month, have brought Kenya's problems into sharp relief, with opposition charges that the President or his aides were instrumental in fomenting the fighting. In an editorial denouncing the Government for the latest violence, which has left thousands homeless and houses and granaries burned, The Nation, Kenya's largest-circulation newspaper, said this week that the clashes were ""creating political acrimony and tension that is threatening national unity."" Pervasive Unease Prevails Tension remains high in the western part of the country, where the tribal violence occurred, and in Nairobi, the capital, a pervasive unease prevails as concern mounts that Mr. Moi will be either unwilling or unable to calm ethnic distrust now rife in a country generally known for its tribal harmony. In the last several days, religious leaders, opposition forces and members of Mr. Moi's governing party have charged the Government with fomenting the clashes as a way of proving that multi-party politics would not work here. How the 67-year-old Mr. Moi, a member of the minority Kalenjin tribe, could expect to come out ahead by alienating the larger tribes, the Kikuyu, Luo and Luhya, was not clear. Some politicians suggested that Mr. Moi, faced with two opposition parties drawn from the larger tribes, was determined after 14 years in power not to go down without a fight. Many Kenyans, from business leaders to clergy, say the unease in the country far deeper than the uncertainties surrounding a short-lived coup attempt in 1982. ""You can't plan for the future,"" a young professional woman said. ""You don't know what's going to happen."" Accentuating the political and tribal troubles is the economic deterioration. In November last year the foreign donors suspended new infusions of aid for six months, calling for improvement in the political and economic management of the country. An American diplomat said this week that a World Bank meeting scheduled for May with Kenyan treasury officials to discuss the resumption of aid would not be held. There was nothing to discuss, he said. A marked increase in violent crime in Nairobi seems to underscore the growing nervousness. Armed hold-ups, once a rarity, have become almost commonplace, according to shopkeepers. At the same time, impoverished urban dwellers are faced with serious food shortages, caused in part by a severe drought but also, economists say, by the Government's pricing policies. There has been virtually no milk or butter in Nairobi for the last month, and people are walking miles to buy containers of water. Last week, during some of the worst violence, Mr. Moi was out of the country on an official visit to Austria, where he was often photographed with President Kurt Waldheim, and on a private trip to Britain. On his return, while attempting a conciliatory tone during visits in the areas where the violence occurred, Mr. Moi accused the main opposition party, the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy, of provoking the violence. In December, Mr. Moi agreed to the introduction of multi-party politics in Kenya. Two main opposition parties quickly formed: the Forum, headed by Kenya's first Vice President, a Luo, Oginga Odinga, and the Democratic Party, headed by another former Vice President, a Kikuyu, Mwai Kibaki. At first, both opposition parties held large, peaceful rallies. But violence started early this month when armed policemen in Nairobi disbanded a group of elderly women hunger strikers protesting the Government's holding of political prisoners. This was quickly followed by the ethnic clashes. According to accounts in the Kenyan newspapers and descriptions from witnesses, the violence involved nighttime arson and attacks by heavily armed groups from members of sub-tribes of the Kalenjin, Mr. Moi's ethnic group. At first the attacks were on villages and market places of Luo people, the second largest tribe in Kenya. Villages of Luhya were also hit, witnesses said. Last week, the violence spread to the rich farming belt of the Rift Valley where many Kikuyu people, the largest tribe in Kenya, have settled on traditional Kalenjin land. Kikuyu workers on the tea estates in the area around a town called Molo described how bands of Kalenjins burned houses, spiked people with spears and terrorized others. The violence around Molo so angered the local member of Parliament, a Kikuyu, Njenja Mungai, that The Nation quoted him as telling the Kalenjins: ""You have taken on the wrong tribe since the Kikuyus will never sit down and watch their children and wives being massacred for no apparent reason."" A member of Mr. Moi's party, the Kenya National African Union, Mr. Mungai was arrested on Monday by the security forces in connection with his anti-Kalenjin statements. As well as seeing tribal ruptures in his own political party, Mr. Moi appears to have lost the confidence of church leaders, who had said they were heartened by the introduction of multi-party politics. In their harshest criticism yet, the 18 Roman Catholic bishops attributed the tribal violence to a ""wider political strategy"" of a Government wanting to show that multi-party politics would result in bloodshed. ""It is difficult for the Government to exonerate itself from the responsiblity of these violent clashes,"" the bishops said in a pastoral letter read in the pulpits last Sunday and published in the newspapers."6-Apr-92,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (95%); UNITED STATES (94%); FRANCE (79%); ANGOLA (79%); BELGIUM (56%);","ZAIRIAN president Mobutu Sese Seko's enormous capacity for corruption and mismanagement has brought that potentially wealthy nation to its knees. His strangling of the economy and his obstruction of the desire of Zairians for democratic change fully justify the recent resolution by the U.S. Congress urging him to step down. Nothing else can save Zaire. In the process of running Zaire into the ground, Mr. Mobutu has squandered fortunes bestowed by his Western patrons. Since he assumed power more than two decades ago, Zaire has taken in almost $ 1 billion in aid from the United States. The World Bank group has approved another $ 1.5 billion in loans and credits. Further direct aid from Belgium, France and others has provided added opportunity for Mr. Mobutu to indulge his personal extravagance and irresponsibility. And what is there in Zaire to show for it? Nothing in the Zairian economy works today except perhaps the printing press: The country's inflation rate is an astonishing 30,000 percent a year, according to the State Department. Its state-run hospitals and schools are closed, the banking system is near collapse, and the capital, Kinshasa, is nearly without telephones, electricity or safe drinking water. People are limited to one meal a day. Much of what Mr. Mobutu has done to his country has unfolded under Western eyes and specifically with American forbearance. The reasons for all that -- the Cold War, the use of Zaire as a transit point to insurgent forces in Angola, and like considerations -- are now gone. But the Western responsibility to help restore dignity and respect to the Zairian people is not. Under the direct pressure of a reportedly strong letter from President Bush, Mr. Mobutu agreed to reconvene a broadly based national conference on April 6, which will prepare for the transition to democratic government. The Zairian president should also negotiate with conference participants on the selection of a new prime minister. That done, he should step aside and allow the transitional government to prepare the way for a new constitution, long awaited free and fair elections, and a reconciled and renewed Zaire."14-May-92,MALAWI (97%); KENYA (94%); FRANCE (88%); LATIN AMERICA (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); AFRICA (79%); MIDDLE EAST (79%); ASIA (79%);,"The World Bank and Western donor nations suspended most aid to the government of Malawi today, citing its poor human rights record and a history of repression under its nonagenarian ""life president,"" Hastings Kamuzu Banda. The decision marks a major step for the World Bank in linking financial assistance to internal political conditions and is certain to send a signal to other such regimes. The donors, meeting in Paris, decided to freeze all of Malawi's 1992-93 aid except humanitarian assistance and drought relief. The suspension is to last for six months, when the donors will review whether Banda's government has made enough ""substantive progress"" toward political reforms to justify resumption of aid. ""Donors are seeking tangible and irreversible evidence of a basic transformation in the way Malawi approaches . . . basic freedoms and human rights,"" according to a World Bank statement issued in Paris. The statement said current projects valued at $ 220 million will continue but that Malawi's request for $ 74 million in new non-humanitarian aid is on hold. In moving against Banda's regime, the donors followed a pattern set last November, when all aid to Kenya was suspended for six months because of evidence of widespread corruption, economic mismanagement and the stifling of political dissent. But in suspending aid to Malawi, the donors appear to have gone further, punishing a government for its political practices and showing little regard for how the economy is run. ""It is different from Kenya,"" said Holly Burkhalter, Washington director of Human Rights Watch. In the case of Kenya, she said by telephone, ""it was the corruption issue that was driving it. This is more of a straight decision on good governance."" Burkhalter said the decision is ""going to resonate not only in Africa, but around the world. If the bank is going to incorporate democratization and human rights in regard to Kenya and Malawi, they can do the same with autocratic governments in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America."" Some reduction in Malawi's aid package had been considered likely because of Banda's recent moves to crack down on voices of dissent that began stirring in March. After the country's Catholic bishops issued a pastoral letter criticizing the government's human rights record, the ruling Malawi Congress Party's executive committee ordered all the bishops executed, according to sources who heard tapes of the meeting. While the order was never carried out, an Irish bishop was deported. When students demonstrated in support of the bishops, security forces reacted harshly, arresting more than a dozen. At least three students are believed to have died in detention. Then labor leader Chakufwa Chihana, who returned from exile to organize an opposition movement, was arrested on April 6. Today, Chihana was visited by a delegation from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, which reported that he did not appear to have been tortured. Last week, a protest by workers turned into a violent melee in Blantyre, the country's former capital. Shops linked to Banda and the ruling party were looted, and government troops fired point-blank at the protesters, killing at least 38. Public transport workers, on strike since Friday, have brought most public transport to a halt and severed road links between the major cities. Foreign embassies in Lilongwe, the capital, are stocking up on food and water. The strikes have now spread to tea plantations, disrupting Malawi's most important export after tobacco. The donors continued humanitarian aid because Malawi is home to about 1 million refugees from Mozambique's civil war. Drought relief was also exempted because Malawi is part of the hard-hit southern African region."30-Aug-92,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (96%); UNITED STATES (93%); AFRICA (92%); CENTRAL AFRICA (79%); NIGERIA (79%); SUDAN (79%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%); BELGIUM (58%);","A Madison Avenue hair stylist who calls himself Mr. Andrew says that every two weeks for the last eight years he has traveled here to cut the hair of President Mobutu Sese Seko. Taking into account Mr. Andrew's first-class air travel from New York, hotel accommodations at the luxurious Inter-Continental Hotel and whatever fee he earns, each presidential haircut is estimated to cost the citizens of Zaire at least $5,000. A few blocks away from the Inter-Continental, in a fetid, fly-infested ward of the Kinoise Clinic, Mwanda Ngimbi is slowly starving to death. Mr. Mwanda entered the hospital in May after he was robbed and shot by a bandit. He was well enough to leave the hospital in mid-June. But Mr. Mwanda, who earned about $15 a month as a taxi driver, had no money, and hospital officials are holding him under armed guard until he pays his medical bills, which now total about $450 and are mounting daily. Behind the Desperation Since the hospital is not feeding Mr. Mwanda and he has no money to buy food, he depends on the charity of other patients. But that is not nearly enough, and now, suffering from severe malnutrition, he is too weak even to sit up. If Mr. Mwanda is a symbol of Zaire's desperation, Mr. Andrew is a symbol of its cause: the corruption and mismanagement of the Government. While its impressive natural resources sit largely undeveloped, this sprawling Central African country of nearly 40 million people is one of the world's poorest, and getting poorer at a rate that has been gathering ominous speed since September 1991, when a paroxysm of looting and arson wiped out much of its modern industry. ""The vast majority of Zaire is now back to subsistence levels,"" said Herman Cohen, the American Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, who came here early this month on a fact-finding mission. ""And for the first time we're seeing cases of malnutrition."" ""It has always been serious,"" he added, ""but now it's getting dangerous."" So Rich, and Yet So Poor Mbongo Nguodja Harouna, a human rights campaigner whose group, the Voice of the Voiceless, has been trying to win the release of Mr. Mwanda and others in his predicament, said: ""People have never suffered like this before.  A lot of them have simply given up hope."" Called the Belgian Congo until independence in 1960, Zaire is as big as the United States east of the Mississippi. It is sub-Saharan Africa's second most populous nation, after Nigeria. It is one of the world's major producers of copper and cobalt. It has climatic and soil conditions suitable for growing a wide range of tropical crops, including cotton, rubber, coffee, palm oil and sugar. This potential has long been frittered away by corruption, brutality and random violence. But the notion persisted that if only the ""bad Zairians"" who surrounded and ill served Mr. Mobutu were reined, in the country would right itself. Few here dared openly blame the President himself. There was also a widespread belief among Zairians that the country was too valuable to the West for it to let the misery continue and that if only the Western powers would turn their attention to solving the crisis Zaire would become the great power it was destined to be. Those days are over. With the end of the cold war, many here have come to realize that the West, and especially the United States, has no intention of rescuing the Zairians from themselves. Repression Is His Weapon ""We've supported them, yes, and we supported Mobutu,"" said a Western diplomat with long experience in Africa. ""But those days are long over. It's a painful thing for many of them to realize, but Zaire is no longer of great strategic interest."" Even without Western help, Mr. Mobutu hangs on despite a rising public clamor for his removal from the autocratic power he has exercised for 27 years. The President retains his grip through old-fashioned repression. Virtually every night, unmarked vehicles roar through Kinshasa's dusty streets, bearing grim-faced men in khaki uniforms without insignia. A recent report by the Zairian Human Rights League said these men -- known to Kinshasa residents as the ""owls"" -- were members of Mr. Mobutu's Special Presidential Guard, and had made numerous assaults against those perceived as political threats to the Government. ""So many people have been attacked and killed by the owls that we can no longer keep track of them,"" said Mr. Harouna of the Voice of the Voiceless. But Mr. Mobutu's power has been eroded. He spends most of his time aboard his yacht in the Congo River, and has entered Kinshasa, Zaire's capital, only twice this year, both times briefly and without advance notice, under the cover of night and with a squadron of heavily armed guards. People say that if he were to enter Kinshasa openly and move among this city's five million citizens it is doubtful that he would get out alive, given his tenuous control over the country's security forces. New Constitution Planned Bending to public outrage, Mr. Mobutu's representatives have been meeting with opposition leaders since July 1991 in a national political conference intended to draft a new constitution and set a schedule for multiparty elections. This month the delegates began drafting a new constitution enshrining a multiparty system and elected Etienne Tschisekedi, Mr. Mobutu's most prominent opponent, as Prime Minister of a transitional government. Mr. Mobutu has recognized these changes, but balked at the delegates' symbolic move to change the country's name back to the Congo, nullifying a name change made by Mr. Mobutu in 1971 as part of his policy of ridding the country of vestiges of its colonial legacy. Critics have seized on the name Zaire as a symbol of the President's autocratic rule. The political conference has deferred the name change. It also appears to have fallen short of the opposition's main objective, namely to force Mr. Mobutu from office, or at least strip him of most of his presidential powers. ""The one thing that everyone agrees on is that we're a long way from getting rid of Mobutu,"" an opposition leader said. ""He's incredibly tenacious, and appears determined to hold onto power at any cost."" Buana Kabwe, chairman of the Zaire League of Human Rights, said: ""Everything else in the country may be falling apart, but nothing has changed for Mobutu. He still treats the treasury as if it's his private purse. And he couldn't care less about our suffering."" Unpaid Soldiers Mutiny Mr. Mobutu's penchant for conspicuous consumption appears unabated. Among his overseas real-estate holdings, for example, are chateaus in Spain and Belgium, a town house in Paris, a villa near Monte Carlo, an estate in Switzerland, a horse ranch in Portugal and a villa in the Ivory Coast. Last September, Mr. Mobutu's rule seemed about to end. Mutinous soldiers, angered because they had not been paid, began a week of looting and violence. According to a report in July by Africa Watch, a New York-based human rights advocacy group, as the rioting spread throughout the country, it eliminated most of what remained of the modern productive sector, outside of mining. In the Kinshasa area alone, 90,000 jobs were lost, and in the course of the looting at least 240 people were killed. Today, whole sections of the country are under the control of local commanders who routinely ignore orders from Kinshasa. The rioting also led to the evacuation of virtually all expatriate workers -- about 20,000 people, mostly from France, Belgium and the United States. They included most of the country's university professors, teaching hospital staff members, and geologists in the mining industry, as well as a host of Belgian development assistance workers who provided a wide range of services to villages in the interior. Many Seek to Leave The economic collapse since the September riots has been staggering. The annual inflation rate is more than 5,000 percent, largely because the Government abandoned an economic recovery program devised by the International Monetary Fund in early 1990 and increased spending. In January 1990, the national currency traded at about 300 to the dollar; today the rate is about 650,000 to the dollar. The September rioting also prompted many Zairians to join the long lines for visas outside every Western embassy. They include many of this country's best-trained and best-educated citizens. Antoine Beltchira Kalubye, a neurosurgeon at the University of Kinshasa's teaching hospital here, said he knew of at least 100 physicians who had left the country in recent months, most for better paying jobs in South Africa. Senior physicians here make about $75 a month; in South Africa, they can earn about the same amount in a day. Consequently, the quality of medical services has declined, hardly reassuring patients who are already leery of the system after the wide publicity given to cases of patients held hostage for their medical bills. ""It has become very bizarre,"" Dr. Kalubye said. ""Nowadays the last place people want to come if they fall sick is the hospital."" 'A Long Way to Go' George Nzongola, a Zairian and a professor of African studies at Howard University in Washington who recently returned here after living 18 years abroad, said conditions were worse now than they were before independence. ""Under colonialism, the decade of the 50's was a period of prosperity in the Belgian Congo,"" said Mr. Nzongola, who is a delegate at the national conference. ""The colonialists invested in economic and social services. So most people had access to very good schools and ate three meals a day."" ""One person recently told me that we've gone backward 250 years,"" Mr. Nzongola added, ""I hope he's not right."" Asked whether he expected conditions to change, even if Mr. Mobutu were suddenly to disappear from the political scene, Mr. Nzongola shrugged his shoulders. ""We've got a long way to go,"" he said, ""and I hope it's not too late."" Map of Zaire. Chart: ""At a Glance: Zaire"" Zaire (called Congo until 1971) was under Belgian control from 1885 to June 1960. A period of instability followed independence until November 1965, when Mobutu Sese Seko seized power in a bloodless coup. He has ruled as an autocrat ever since. Although Zaire was classified by the World Bank as the world's 12th poorest country in 1990, with a per capita income of $220, it is the world's largest producer of cobalt and the second-largest producer of industrial diamonds. Exports of both commodities are believed to have fallen by as much as 50 percent in the last two years. Zaire's other important mineral product is copper, which accounts for 35 to 55 percent of the country's export earnings. Copper production has fallen by 40 percent since 1986. Inflation has sharply eroded the value of the Zairian currency. In April, all Zairian banks closed because of cash shortages. Except for the police and armed forces, most civil servants have not been paid for several months. Zaire's nearly 40 million people are divided among many tribes, with the largest being the Kongo, Kwango-Kwilu, Mongo, Luba, Bwaka and Zande. The majority speak Bantu languages, though the north is linguistically Sudanese. The lingua franca is French. Zaire is the third largest country in Africa, one-quarter the size of the United States. Its dominant geographic feature is the Congo River. With vast forests and plenty of rainfall, Zaire has huge agricultural, logging and hydroelectic potential."4-Nov-92,ETHIOPIA (97%); UNITED STATES (93%); NORTH AMERICA (79%);,"Jennifer Parmelee's Oct. 6 article on Ethiopia seemed to be based on propaganda from the Tigrean-dominated Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front. She wrote that the Oromo Liberation Front willfully withdrew from and declared war on the Ethiopian government. However, the OLF withdrew only from the June elections to protest electoral fraud by the EPRDF. The OLF was not alone in this; 15 of the 24 organizations that constituted the transitional government of Ethiopia either withdrew from the elections or demanded a nullification of the results. It was only after Meles Zenawi, chairman of the Tigrean People's Liberation Front, tried to pressure the OLF out of the government and EPRDF forces started offensive maneuvers against OLF forces that the OLF was compelled to withdraw from the coalition. The Oromo make up nearly half of the Ethiopian population. Therefore, the OLF has no fear of democracy, unlike the EPRDF, whose leadership core is Tigrean, an ethnic group comprising less than 7 percent of the Ethiopian population. The OLF has never declared war on anyone. Its defense forces are quite modest compared with the EPRDF's army of some 120,000. The OLF did not go into Tigray; the EPRDF came into Oromia. Nevertheless, the OLF has not been ""defeated,"" with or without ""relative ease,"" as Jennifer Parmelee asserted. Our defense forces are putting up effective resistance to Tigrean forces. Unfortunately, far from ""sampling its first taste of stability,"" Ethiopia is now witnessing war spread out over a much wider area than at any time in recent history. Such instability is not difficult to understand when, under pretenses of democracy, a ruling party dominated by a tiny ethnic group retains 96.6 percent of the seats in the legislature of a multinational country. Finally, although it is true that a considerable amount of multilateral and bilateral American assistance is in the pipeline for Ethiopia, none of the former and little of the latter has been released to date. It is the OLF's contention that all nonhumanitarian aid should be conditioned upon democratization, and, to this end, the OLF is petitioning both the World Bank and the United States. TAMAM YOUSSOUF Representative in North America Oromo Liberation Front Washington"20-Nov-93,NIGERIA (99%);,"With the generals once again in open and absolute command, Nigeria is facing the prospect of economic chaos, political upheaval and perhaps even conflict between its two major tribes, the politically dominant Hausa in the north and the restive Yoruba in the southwest, Nigerians, diplomats and foreign experts say. Some of the experts say the crisis is more dire than any since 1967, when the eastern region called Biafra tried to split away, plunging the country into three years of civil war that cost up to a million lives. The current crisis began when the military Government, which planned for six years to return to civilian rule, abruptly reneged on the promise after presidential elections in June. Amid street protests, the military leader, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, handed power over to a transitional Government nominally headed by a civilian, Ernest Shonekan. Now that Government has been shoved aside by another military strongman, Gen. Sani Abacha. On Wednesday, General Abacha was installed as Nigeria's seventh military leader since independence from Britain in 1960. He promptly began dismantling the democratic institutions that had been carefully constructed, abolishing national and state assemblies, dissolving the two military-created political parties, removing elected state governors and proscribing all political meetings and associations. General Suspected of Corruption ""We did not expect destruction of this magnitude of the democratic structures,"" Albert Legogie, deputy president of the now-defunct Senate, told The Associated Press. Like many of Nigeria's military rulers, General Abacha is widely thought by diplomats, experts and other Nigerians to be corrupt, with a substantial income from the country's rich oil industry, from construction projects in the new capital, Abuja, and various other Government contracts and building permits. Leaders of Nigerian civil rights and pro-democracy groups assailed General Abacha's seizure of power. A statement from the Civil Liberties Organization called on Nigerians to reject ""a power-corrupted military bent on turning free citizens to slaves in their own country."" But on Thursday, in a brisk 10-minute address to the nation, General Abacha warned that he was not a man to brook disorder. ""Any attempt to test our will will be decisively dealt with,"" he vowed. But he gave little idea of what he had in mind for an anxious country. He talked vaguely about setting up a constitutional conference to chart Nigeria's future but, in what many read as an ominous sign, he did not set any date for handing power back to civilians. As Defense Minister and before that as army Chief of Staff, General Abacha was a major player in Nigeria's corrupt and politicized military. He helped to engineer the coup that overthrew the last civilian Government in December 1983, and another one that brought General Babangida to power in 1985. Ever since General Babangida stepped aside in August and installed an interim Government under Mr. Shonekan, the 50-year-old General Abacha has been the true power behind the scenes. Some diplomats believe that the two generals had a falling out, and they point out that one of General Abacha's first moves during the brief stewardship of Mr. Shonekan was to remove key military commanders put in place by General Babangida. Tribal and Regional Rivalries Some pronounced General Babangida discredited and finished. But others said that reports of the rift are greatly exaggerated, and they did not rule out an attempt by General Babangida to stage a political comeback at some point. ""It could be that Babangida is playing a long game in which he will emerge as a presidential candidate in an election organized by Abacha,"" said one expert interviewed here. Both generals are Muslims from the Hausa-speaking north, which has traditionally produced top officers and has dominated politics in the country of 90 million people. By contrast, Moshood Abiola, the man who is generally thought to have won the June elections, is a Yoruba from the south, though he, too, is a Muslim. The interim leader, Mr. Shonekan, who never achieved a popular base of support, was likewise a Yoruba. The Yoruba, concentrated around the economic and political center, Lagos, are beginning to ""chafe under the northern yoke,"" as one Nigerian politician put it when interviewed by telephone from Lagos. Referring to the center of Yoruba culture, he said, ""People in Abeokuta are wondering why northerners always outmaneuver southerners."" The third major section of the country, which produces the oil that brings in 95 percent of export earnings, is the east, where the Ibo predominate. They have not assumed a major role in national life since losing the civil war. Demonstrations in Southwest Most of the strikes and protests against the annulment of the elections occurred in the southwest. The protests were given a lift last week when a court in Lagos ruled that General Babangida had no power to install an interim Government and that the Government was thus illegal. Today, clashes between the police and pro-democracy demonstrators were reported in three southwestern cities, Abeokuta, Akure and Ilorin. Lagos was quiet. Banks, major shops and factories remained closed, as they have been since last week. Those demonstrations were caused by the announcement of a sixfold increase in the price of fuel. The increase was part of a spate of economic reforms undertaken by Mr. Shonekan under the prodding of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Until the increase, Government fuel subsidies drove the retail price down to about 12 cents a gallon. Because of price differences with surrounding countries, where it sold between $4 and $5 a gallon, smuggling was rife. Much of it involved the military. Despite its oil exports, which produced $11.7 billion in 1992, Nigeria's economy is in trouble. The country's foreign debts amount to about $30 billion, and arrears on its debts total about $5 billion. If General Abacha rolls back the fuel increase in a bid for instant popularity, he would be undercutting the austerity program on which hopes for an economic recovery are pinned."15-Jan-94,KENYA (99%); AFRICA (79%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%);,"After weeks of a growing political storm in which he was accused of corruption, racism and mismanagement, Richard Leakey, renowned paleontologist and director of the Kenya Wildlife Service, resigned today. In his five years as head of the wildlife service, Mr. Leakey had been widely praised by both Kenyans and conservationists for rescuing and reinvigorating the organization, by ridding it of corruption and poachers and rebuilding its ranks. In a country where wildlife is not only the biggest tourist attraction but also the major foreign exchange earner, Mr. Leakey attracted millions of dollars in foreign aid money and transformed the moribund agency into a success story. His resignation must still be accepted by President Daniel arap Moi. Western diplomats say it points to the corruption and underlying greed prevalent among powerful ministers in Kenya who have mounted the attacks against Mr. Leakey in an effort to get their hands on the money flowing into the wildlife agency. 'Stress and Pain' ""I have no wish to give my life at this time, and the stress and pain of being vilified by senior politicians and others is more than I think is good for my health,"" Mr. Leakey said at a news conference. ""I have offered my resignation."" He continued to work as head of the agency despite losing both legs in a plane crash in Kenya last year. He has since been fitted with artificial legs. ""If there are concerns about how the K.W.S. is run, let there be a public inquiry with clear terms of reference,"" he said, rejecting the allegations. With what even his enemies describe as extreme willpower, the 48-year-old paleontologist has always confronted his challenges head on, but in the past weeks, Mr. Leakey has come to face his most critical battle. He was pitted against Kenya's most powerful politicians; and more than 23 Government officials demanded his resignation. It was also a battle over the nature of changing conservation needs in East Africa and particularly in Kenya, where poaching is under control but there is a new conflict between humans and animals over shrinking land. Those who have come to Mr. Leakey's support include Western donors and the World Bank, who have injected about $150 million into the wildlife agency, as well as prominent opposition members and Kenyan intellectuals such as Wangari Maathai, an environmentalist. She said in a statement that ""some politicians"" wanted to replace Mr. Leakey with a political stooge who would bring about the looting of the game parks and would use the game park workers in ethnic cleansing against certain tribes. Mr. Leakey, a third generation Kenyan and son of paleontologists Louis and Mary Leakey, was head of the National Museum when he took over in 1988 as director of the newly created wildlife service. The national park system was on the verge of collapse. In the previous 15 years, Kenya's elephant population had dropped from more than 100,000 to 19,000. Mr. Leakey was responsible for Kenya's strong stance against the ivory trade, and he mounted a huge antipoaching campaign that virtually eradicated poaching from the country's game parks."7-Jun-94,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (95%); AFRICA (94%); NIGERIA (93%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%); UNITED STATES (79%); CENTRAL AFRICA (79%); JAPAN (79%);","Traveler to Zaire, beware! Stepping off the sweltering tarmac at Ndjili, the new arrival becomes a helpless fish in a sea of sharks. Snap! The passport disappears, perhaps taken by the man with some kind of emblem fastened to his lapel by a paper clip. Snip! The luggage goes off in two directions. The visitor is led into a darkened office for interrogation. The passport magically reappears. But there are problems: Something strange about the visa, perhaps. An ulterior motive for your visit? The questions swirl into a crescendo of accusations. But perhaps all this can be overlooked. A $50 bill on the table is scooped up like raw bait. More money is required to locate the suitcases and get through customs and then to pay off the touts and soldiers who cram into the taxi peeling off toward the capital. The departure is worse, for now the visitor has been here long enough to commit certain offenses. Smuggling? Black market trading? Spying? The interrogation can last an hour or more. It slows to an impasse as the flight is being announced. The extortion of money from visitors by officials who receive no regular pay is only the most superficial manifestation of a malady that runs deep in Zaire and some other African countries. Corruption is a constant source of conversation, but it is never mentioned in studies by the World Bank or the United Nations. Unlike eruptions of scandals in, say, Italy or Japan, the corruption here never erupts; it is a constant, diplomats, scholars and Africans themselves say. It runs up and down through the entire country, from the soldier in sunglasses who flags down a motorist to extract a bribe for an imaginary infraction to President Mobutu Sese Seko, who has become one of the world's richest men by plundering Zaire's treasury. ""This isn't just greasing the wheels so that the pie keeps growing. It's an impediment to growth, pure and simple,"" said an American State Department official. The gross national product of almost all countries south of the Sahara has been in a decline for over a decade, and while there are many reasons for this, corruption and economic mismanagement rank high among them. Nigeria, gushing with oil and go-for-broke capitalism, is widely deemed to be the most corrupt country in West Africa. Beginning in the early 1970's -- when 20 million tons of cement was ordered in a kickback scheme that clogged the harbor with sinking freighters -- generations of leaders have enriched themselves. The Economist magazine estimated in April that about $3 billion -- or 10 percent of the gross domestic product -- ""disappeared"" out of Nigeria's public accounts in 1992. If Nigeria is the king of ""dash"" in West Africa, Zaire is the undisputed champion in central Africa. ""Everything is for sale -- anything can be bought in our country,"" Mr. Mobutu once said. One former Foreign Minister, Nguza Karl-I-Bond -- who was sentenced to death for treason and fled into exile and is inexplicably back working as a deputy defense minister -- testified in Washington in the 1970's that Mr. Mobutu had stashed away $5 billion. One Western diplomat said he thinks the president ""operates more like a franchise system -- he'll give you the exclusive right to import chickens from Europe or to sell fish to the army or to operate cellular telephones."" Not long ago, Telecel, a largely American-owned company, was granted an exclusive contract to operate a cellular phone system. Then another outfit mysteriously appeared, owned by the son of Bemba Saolona, one of Mr. Mobutu's closest associates. Telecel cables were cut. Then a microwave appeared on a nearby building, jamming its antenna. Local papers call it the ""battle of the frequencies,"" but nobody doubts who is going to win."6-Aug-94,AFRICA (98%); COTE D'IVOIRE (95%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (94%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%); HOLY SEE (90%); FRANCE (90%);,"Felix Houphouet-Boigny, the longtime president of this West African nation, died at 88 last December. In this jungle-enclosed city, his birthplace, stand the monuments to his grandiose ambitions -- for himself and for Africa's economic future. Few sub-Saharan African countries achieved anything like the economic success Ivory Coast enjoyed during the 1960s and 1970s under Houphouet-Boigny's firm hand. Lifted by French investment and rising production of cash crops, Ivorian personal incomes soared as the economy hit double-digit rates of expansion in some years. Steel and glass skyscrapers went up in the coastal city of Abidjan as it blossomed into a seaside playground for European expatriates. In Yamoussoukro, the newly declared, underpopulated inland capital, no expense was spared on avenues wide enough for jumbo jets, thousands of streetlights, three universities, half a dozen hotels, an airport, car dealerships, a radio and microwave transmission tower, landscaped gardens, playing fields, artificial lakes, the world's largest Catholic basilica (a replica -- but on a far grander scale -- of St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City) and a presidential family palace guarded by crocodiles and stone walls more than a mile around. Yamoussoukro was ""the ultra-modern prefiguration of the Africa of tomorrow,"" exhorted a hotel brochure from the early 1980s. But now the promised future has arrived, and it is none too exhilarating. Since 1980, personal incomes in Ivory Coast have shrunk by a staggering 50 percent. Debt has soared to about $ 18 billion, leaving the country with one of the highest rates of debt per capita in the world. The economy has been contracting steadily since 1987, dragging Ivory Coast from its earlier middle income status toward the ranks of the world's poorest economies. And Yamoussoukro's extravagance, far from the crowning symbol of Houphouet-Boigny's Ivorian miracle, today looks to have been ""a terrible economic step,"" said Joseph Yao, director of the Ivorian Center for Economic and Social Research. ""One of the basics of economics is that you create before you distribute,"" he added. ""In Africa, we started distributing and figured we would create later."" Across sub-Saharan Africa, more than two dozen countries and tens of millions of impoverished people are paying the price for years of misdirected investment, unbalanced development, squandered savings, government mismanagement and corruption, ineffective foreign aid programs, falling commodity prices and the brutal imperatives of a global economy that is leaving Africa behind while it races toward the next century. On average, the region's economy shrunk 1.2 percent each year between 1980 and 1991, according to the World Bank. It has recovered slightly since then, according to the African Development Bank, but not enough to keep pace with swelling populations. The bank's forecast for 1994 is more of the same, at best. As a consequence, rising numbers of Africans are sliding into poverty as each year passes. To many African economists, politicians and businessmen, the decline is especially galling because it has occurred while other areas of the developing world -- southeast Asia, China, India and much of Latin America -- have expanded economically, in some cases by leaps and bounds. Consider Nigeria and Indonesia, for instance -- both oil-rich and heavily populated at independence. In 1973, when world oil prices first boomed, their per capita economies were the same size -- which is to say, very small. By 1990, average incomes in Indonesia had doubled, but in Nigeria they had fallen, despite billions of dollars in windfall revenues. Ghana and South Korea had the same per capita incomes just 35 years ago. Today the average South Korean is richer than the average Portuguese, but the average Ghanaian is poorer than he or she was 20 years ago. To an overwhelming majority of Western economists at lending institutions such as the World Bank, and to increasing numbers of their African counterparts, the cause of this disparity -- and of Ivory Coast's failed miracle -- is no great mystery. It boils down, they say, to disastrous economic policies. In a detailed survey of the sub-Saharan African economy published by the World Bank in February, the bank's economists rated the economic policies of 26 regional governments on a scale from ""good"" to ""very poor."" Not a single African government was rated good, and only one, Ghana, was judged adequate. Nearly half were rated poor or very poor, including Ivory Coast, which ranked near the bottom. Most African governments intervene heavily and inefficiently in nearly every economic sector. Hundreds of uncompetitive state-owned monopolies smother business competition. High taxes and tariffs throttle international trade and foreign investment. Unsustainable price subsidies and welfare benefits for city dwellers lead to heavy government borrowing and, in some cases, high rates of inflation. Artificially high exchange rates for many African currencies, which make it easier for urban African elites to buy cheap luxury imports, smother exports and punish farmers in the countryside, where most of Africa's poorest live. Corruption and theft by African government leaders and their allies sap national savings that might otherwise be reinvested in productive businesses. ""This is my country too, so I have the right to work without giving someone money underneath the table,"" complained Bergson Koffi, a U.S.-trained Ivorian businessman who said he has spent about $ 1 million since 1986 trying unsuccessfully to get licenses for a new cellular phone company. Koffi alleged that government employees involved in potentially competitive deals block his progress. ""They're trying to make me waste time so I will give up,"" he said. Many businessmen do just that. As the pressures of failed economic policies have caused African economies to shrink, political instability and ethnic conflict have risen, frightening off foreign investors and crippling local businesses. Japanese car and truck makers, for example, keep their inventories floating on container ships off the East African coast, only docking when they have an order, because they judge it too risky and inefficient to keep their vehicles in showrooms, according to the Harvard Business School. One worsening problem is a relative lack of skilled managers. Unlike in other regions of the Third World, African governments did not use heavy control over their economies after independence to force rapid industrialization, with its side benefits of new technologies and trained work forces. Instead, they relied on agricultural and mineral exports, which among other things provided easy money for crooked governments. Today, nine out of 10 dollars earned from African exports come from raw materials and agricultural crops, by far the highest percentage worldwide. As in Ivory Coast, such African resource exports typically pass through inefficient government-controlled marketing boards that are widely described as money machines for government ministers and their political allies. Farmers themselves are heavily taxed, directly and indirectly. ""It was a clear political choice that the government will control all the money coming into the country"" from cocoa and coffee exports, said Ivorian businessman Mahamadou Sylla. ""The whole system was based on that. ... The president and the government wanted this power."" Yet the total pool of money available has steadily declined. That is partly because Africa's dependence on commodity exports is at odds with a basic global economic trend toward increased manufacturing. As more countries shovel resources into the global trading economy, and as more wealth around the world is created by adding value with manufacturing and new technologies, the relative importance -- and relative price -- of many African resources has declined. Small and fragile to begin with, sub-Saharan Africa's industrial sector has shrunk even faster during the last decade than its overall economy, according to the Overseas Development Institute. New foreign investment in African industry, although growing, is a tiny fraction of such investment worldwide. Western banks, governments and multilateral agencies sometimes reinforce failure in Africa with poorly designed or self-interested loan and aid programs, according to some critics, both Western and African. In West Africa, for example, France spends what diplomats estimate as $ 2 billion to $ 5 billion annually to subsidize former colonies that today pursue what many Western economists see as highly inefficient economic policies. The World Bank, under what bankers and diplomats describe as heavy French pressure, has kicked in large sums to support these West African governments, including Ivory Coast. Some Western-funded economic policies that many economists see as inefficient for Africans have nonetheless benefited Western business and political interests, said economists, diplomats and businessmen. Japanese and European aid programs to Africa heavily emphasize credits tied to the purchase of machinery from the donor's own corporations. Businessmen in Tokyo and London come up with ideas about how African countries can use their products, then try to sell these aid ideas to their governments. ""If you look at the amount of money the [World] Bank and the French government poured into the economy to support these weaknesses, it's really quite scandalous,"" said development economist Roger Riddell. World Bank officials say that while some of their past policies may be debatable, the bulk of responsibility for failure lies with recipient African governments. And lately, World Bank economists argue, there are signs of new commitment to economic reform in many sub-Saharan African countries. Indeed, while the region's overall economic picture is gloomy, there are pockets of exception where governments have aggressively pursued free-market-oriented reform programs and have been rewarded with persistent economic growth. In Ghana, where President Jerry Rawlings has stuck with painful reforms for a decade, the economy has grown by an average 5 to 6 percent each year since 1983. The World Bank, which desperately needs an African success story to serve as a model for its economic prescriptions, hails Ghana as a regional leader. As with Ivory Coast earlier, however, the question is whether Ghana's achievements will last. A decade of robust growth has pulled Ghana from the deep economic pit into which it had fallen by the early 1980s. Investment has been redirected to rural areas. New businesses are opening, the infrastructure is improving, and some foreign and expatriate Ghanaian investors are starting to speak confidently of the future. Yet some economists argue that with a swelling population, even Ghana's respectable growth rates are not good enough. Technology-driven industrial investment has been slow to materialize. Although the government has not squandered revenue on grandiose white elephants such as Ivory Coast's Yamoussoukro, Ghana has been hesitant to privatize state businesses or to loosen its grip on commodity marketing boards. Why don't more African governments adopt free-market-oriented programs similar to Ghana's? One key reason, Africans and outside analysts say, is political. The failed economic policies pursued by many African leaders for the last three decades have not been entirely irrational: They were often constructed to enrich undemocratic leaders and to appease the urban populations that pose the greatest political threat to these leaders. Government control of the economy, overvalued exchange rates, lavish subsidies and other similar policies allow otherwise weak or illegitimate African politicians to buy off opponents and build empires of patronage, especially in urban areas that are key to political control. Free market reform as prescribed by the World Bank often means pulling the plug on these political lifelines, most dramatically in the cities. Urban revolt in the aftermath of economic liberalization ""is a frightening prospect,"" said D.F. Annan, speaker of Ghana's parliament. In Ghana, the revolt never came. But in other African countries, ""IMF riots,"" as they are called, have become a regular -- and to African political leaders, often terrifying -- consequence of attempted economic change. Yet in this African trap of immovable leaders and irresistible economic decline, a new generation of Africans increasingly insists that something has to give. In politics, these younger Africans are the driving force of the continent's nascent democracy movement. In economics, despite the high government-imposed barriers, they represent a new wave of entrepreneurial, sometimes Western-trained managers who want Africa to succeed as Asia and much of Latin America already have done. Many of these younger, business-minded Africans are visible in relatively prosperous, dynamic cities such as Accra and Abidjan. Among them is Luc Tanoh, a young Ivorian computer engineer and businessman who is struggling to succeed amid Ivory Coast's economic rubble. ""With a new generation coming, a new civilization is emerging. Young Africans born after independence, trained in their country ... are really the resources lacking in the past. ""If today Africa is not able to seize this opportunity, the young human resources, then we will really be in trouble.""  Staff researcher Alice Crites in Washington and special correspondent Cindy Shiner in Abidjan contributed to this report."4-Sep-94,AFRICA (99%); ZIMBABWE (94%); SOUTH AFRICA (93%); UNITED STATES (93%); SOMALIA (92%); ANGOLA (92%); DJIBOUTI (92%); FRANCE (90%); RWANDA (79%); EUROPE (79%); LIBERIA (79%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%); SUDAN (79%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%);,"When Nelson Mandela was sworn in as president of South Africa in May, the last of the three great conflicts that have shaped the modern history of Africa came to an end. Apartheid was vanquished. The struggle against colonialism ended in victory when Djibouti won independence from France in 1977 and British-controlled Rhodesia became independent Zimbabwe in 1980. The end of the Cold War also put an end to the proxy conflicts between Moscow and Washington that ravaged the continent from Angola to Somalia. Angola's war continues, but it is no longer a contest between Moscow and Washington. These historic developments ought to have been unrelieved good news for sub-Saharan Africa. But in many countries, what loomed as an era of promise dissolved into one of drift and disorder as Africa was increasingly left to its own devices. Except for televised disasters, and triumphs like Mandela's inauguration, Africa largely disappeared from the agenda of the major powers after the conflicts that interested them came to an end. With its limited economic clout and endemic corruption, and without the moral imperative of the movement against South Africa's apartheid system of racial separation, Africa no longer commands the same level of international concern as it did when rivals elsewhere needed African votes in the United Nations. Now mostly on its own, Africa has entered another period of struggle, perhaps more brutal than the first three: order against chaos. In the gloomiest forecasts, the disintegrations of Somalia, Rwanda, Liberia and Sudan project Africa's future, with the centrifugal forces in many countries compounded by international indifference. ""Africa is left adrift at a time of economic crisis, perpetuating its sense of marginalization, frustration and anger over its seeming abandonment,"" scholars John W. Harbeson and Donald Rothchild wrote in ""Africa in World Politics."" ""The picture that emerged at the end of the 1980s was one of increasing African peripheralization,"" they wrote. ""The explanation for this phenomenon varied, but it included the end of the Cold War, the industrialized countries' disillusionment with the economic and political performance of the African states, and the growing preoccupation of the developed countries with their own economic problems."" The CIA demonstrated this point in June when it floated a plan to close 15 stations in Africa to save money. Africa was targeted because the agency was never really interested in it anyway, a senior CIA official said. ""We have never been in Africa to report on Africa,"" he said. ""We went into Africa as part of the covert activity of the Cold War,"" because it was easier to recruit Cuban and East European agents there than in their home countries. The British international relief agency Oxfam, in a report last year, complained that the industrialized nations, ""preoccupied with more 'strategic' concerns elsewhere ... have allowed Africa, the world's most impoverished region, to become increasingly marginalized. ""Financial resource flows are stagnating in real terms, debt-relief measures have been inadequate, and there has been no attempt to improve the region's external trade environment,"" Oxfam said. ""To make matters worse, the international donor community and multilateral agencies -- the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund -- continue to insist on economic policy reforms which have manifestly failed to generate recovery, while imposing huge social costs."" In a speech last May, James Gustave Speth, director of the United Nations Development Program, argued that it was in developed nations' self-interest to help Africa. If they do not, he said, disease, poverty and environmental degradation in Africa will ensure that ""our own shores"" will be affected by ""illegal aliens, refugees, drugs, crime"" and other problems from Africa. But he also noted that most nations' attention is focused elsewhere. Russia, once a looming military presence in the Horn of Africa and patron of leftist regimes from Ethiopia to Mozambique, has all but withdrawn from the continent. The United States, which was heavily engaged in Africa as a counterweight to the Soviets, has ""no strategic interests in Africa,"" according to Pentagon doctrine. Among the industrialized nations, the United States ranks last in percentage of gross national product devoted to African aid. Except for diplomatic involvement, Britain, Belgium and Portugal mostly disappeared from Africa when they surrendered their colonies there. Japanese investment is minimal. Among the major powers, only France remains actively committed in Africa, with troops in seven countries, extensive economic and political ties and effective control of the currency of its former colonies in West Africa. ""We have intervened in Africa whenever an unacceptable situation had to be remedied,"" former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing once said -- a comment that applied perfectly to the recent, two-month French military intervention in Rwanda. So thin is U.S. political and economic interest in Africa that one of the panels at a recent White House conference on Africa was devoted to the subject of ""constituency building"" -- how to get more people to care. Donald McHenry, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the United States has ""a general responsibility [for Africa] in the interests of mankind, and given the melting pot nature of our society it carries something of a special interest as the origin of 10 or 12 percent of our population."" But McHenry suggested that direct U.S. interest in Africa is limited to heading off disasters such as the Rwandan refugee crisis, because ""when disaster occurs, man-made or nature, we are going to end up paying for some of it."" U.S. policy makers and some independent analysts say South Africa is capable of vigorous economic growth that will also contribute to the development of its neighbors. But ""whereas South Africa and the southern African region increasingly command our attention for both economic and political reasons, much of the rest of the continent is becoming more marginal in terms of U.S. national interest priorities,"" said Walter H. Kansteiner, White House Africa policy director in the Bush administration. Western thinking about sub-Saharan Africa appears generally divided along the lines of optimism vs. pessimism. The optimists see a new generation of realistic African leaders adopting economic and political reforms that could lead to peace and prosperity. They also see indigenous peace and human rights movements increasingly asserting themselves and putting pressure on leaders to abandon repressive policies. The pessimists see an accelerating slide into the chaos and anarchy tearing apart Somalia, Rwanda, Sudan, Liberia and Angola. In both views, what happens to Africa in the coming decade is largely up to the Africans, not to the foreign powers that for decades manipulated Africa for their own ends. The most pessimistic prospect was offered by Robert D. Kaplan in an apocalyptic article in the February issue of Atlantic Monthly, ""The Coming Anarchy."" According to Kaplan, overpopulation, crime, corruption and the ready availability of weapons will doom virtually all of West Africa to lapse into malarial anarchy. He predicted a breakdown of civilization as ""foreign embassies are shut down, states collapse, and contact with the outside world takes place through dangerous, disease-ridden coastal trading posts."" Envisioning a lawless era in which the writ of government will not extend to the African interior, Kaplan said Africa ""faces cataclysms that could make the Ethiopian and Somalian famines pale in comparison."" President Clinton and each of his senior foreign policy advisers have read Kaplan's article, a White House official said recently. According to White House National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, an Africa specialist, the challenge facing the outside world is figuring out how to help Africa avoid the nightmare predicted by Kaplan and achieve instead ""a culture of tolerance, a flowering of civil society and the protection of human dignity throughout the continent."" But the tools available to achieve that lofty goal do not include an increase in direct U.S. aid, which is holding steady at about $ 800 million a year, much of it directed at South Africa. Instead, U.S. policy envisions a new political and economic climate in Africa that will encourage indigenous development and foreign investment. Some analysts dismiss that as pie in the sky. But others -- including the U.N. Development Program's Speth and Michael Clough, Africa policy specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations -- argue that U.S. and other foreign aid in the past has done more harm than good as Africans squandered it on extravagant projects and arms purchases. Clough, who was Africa issues director for the Clinton transition team, wrote in his book ""Free at Last?"" that the bulk of U.S. assistance to Africa during the Cold War went to six countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, Liberia, Somalia, Sudan and Zaire. ""By any standard, this is not a list of African success stories,"" he wrote. Clough said in an interview that the argument over aid funding levels is ""absurd"" because amounts available will never be enough to make a significant difference. That being the case, he said the Clinton administration's evolving long-term approach, stressing human rights and free markets to stimulate economic growth and thus head off disasters such as the one in Somalia, ""makes sense in Africa."" But he questioned whether it can succeed, because ""there is very little political payoff"" in Africa and ""nobody except Lake cares about Africa anyway."" Optimists about Africa said in interviews that it is necessary to distinguish between failed states such as Somalia and old-fashioned African ""big man"" dictatorships such as Togo on the one hand and the more open, stable countries with new pragmatic rulers on the other. This list includes Benin, Eritrea, Mali, Zambia and Uganda as well as South Africa. Africans ""want the same things everybody else wants,"" said Vivian Lowery Derryck, president of the African American Institute in New York, and they are throwing their support to leaders and movements that hold the promise of delivering. She predicted that Sudan and possibly Zaire will break apart, but she said there are several countries where ""pragmatic"" leaders have come to power and where it is reasonable for foreigners to consider investing. ""There is a new class of African business people emerging who are not victims of the past,"" said Frank Savage, a prominent African-American financier whose Alliance Capital Corp. has set up an Africa investment fund. ""They were born after independence. All they want now is a higher standard of living."" ""You would be amazed at how many countries have adopted structural adjustments"" that make them economically attractive, he said. ""It may still be a little early for a lot of investors, but it's time to look at countries that may be investor-friendly,"" such as Ghana, he said. Savage said the worldwide ""commodity cycle"" is favorable to Africa as prices rise in a general economic recovery. A test of his evaluation, and of Africa's interest for potential investors, is scheduled for mid-October, when a major international oil and gas conference assembles in Cape Town, South Africa. This event -- of a type common in Houston, London and Singapore but virtually unknown in Africa -- will bring together oil and gas executives and government officials from all across Africa to assess the natural gas potential of Mozambique, offshore oil exploration in Cameroon, recent natural gas discoveries in Namibia and a score of similar issues. Invitations to this conference from its sponsor, the authoritative trade journal Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, stress that ""many African nations are actively promoting investment through extensive deregulation, privatization and divestment policies."" That is just what the Clinton administration likes to hear, but often does not. ""The policies this administration supports are not necessarily supported by African leaders,"" an administration official said. ""Democracy, open markets, the development of indigenous human rights groups, rural empowerment -- these are not necessarily what African leaders want. They imply political development."" But Africans increasingly understand the need for popular participation in political and economic life, said Roble Olhaye, Djibouti's ambassador to the United Nations. ""They know corruption, nepotism, waste and human rights abuses have to go,"" he said in an interview. ""That is the order of the day."""26-May-95,AFRICA (96%); COTE D'IVOIRE (93%); NIGERIA (93%); SENEGAL (79%);,"For 30 years, the African Development Bank has dispensed advice and lent money in volumes that place it second only to the World Bank among international lenders for Africa's economic development. But the World Bank's effectiveness has been questioned lately in the face of sharp declines in the economies of many African countries. And as the African Development Bank has prepared for the election of a new president, bitter exchanges over allegations of corruption have nearly overshadowed a critical debate over lending policy. Futhermore, African members of the bank and the industrial nations that provide 35 percent of its $24 billion capital are in a tense debate over the need to restructure the bank's approach to lending. Although the corruption allegation have been simmering for months, they only became public when the departing president, Babacar Ndiaye of Senegal, circulated a memorandum last week to the governors, the top supervisory body, charging shady dealings by bank directors. In his memo, Mr. Ndiaye portrayed many of the 18 directors as more concerned with their own finances and perquisites than with African development. He contended that many spend their time flying around the world with their families on ""disguised missions"" at the bank's expense, conducting private business while collecting fat indemnities for travel and health care, and he said some launder money from their personal enterprises through the bank. Mr. Ndiaye also criticized their activities at the headquarters in Abidjan, a striking three-winged skyscraper that is the anchor of this city's skyline. Though he did not identify which of the directors, 12 Africans and 6 Westerners, he considered guilty of such practices, insiders say the allegation involved both African and non-African board members. Mr. Ndiaye's assertions drew a blistering written rebuke from the board, which saw them as ""worrisome changes in the behavior"" of an embittered president. The board said his actions would have a ""destabilizing effect on the institution."" The bank planned to choose Mr. Ndiaye's successor on Thursday in an election in Abuja, the capital of Nigeria [Five rounds of voting on Thursday ended in a stalemate, with no candidate obtaining a majority, Reuters reported from Abuja.] Beyond the trading of accustions looms a broader debate over lending policies that may determine whether the bank can remain an important player in the continent's finances. The bank's members are in arrears for $600 million in loan repayments, which critics say is largely due to loans for poorly conceived and supervised projects. This unpaid debt, and the insolvency of other countries, has left only 14 of the 52 African member states eligible to borrow under current policies. African member have said an increase in capital is vital to meet the needs of the world's poorest continent. But donor countries say they will provide more money only if they are given more say in management. The United States, which provides 6 percent of the bank's capital, more than any other non-African member, supports that position. The bank, which provides loans at both commerical and subsidized rates to African member countries, was founded in 1963 by 23 nations. Since 1966, it has lent over $29 billion. Many Africans already feel marginalized in a world where everything from interest rates to commodity prices are determined in faraway financial capitals. But the donor nations say the bank can draw on the outside support it needs only if it becomes more rigorous in its management. ""The Western powers do not want the African members of the A.D.B. to decide on their own who should get a loan from the bank,"" said B.O. Tonwe, the director from Nigeria, the largest African shareholder. ""That is the main struggle going on here."" Mr. Tonwe said donors were increasingly using their financial influence to impose political criteria on lending, penalizing countries like his own, which have fallen out of favor internationally over questions of democracy and human rights. [Angered by Nigeria's refusal to withdraw its candidate from the election for a new president, donor nations agreed after votes Thursday in Abuja to suspend talks on a much delayed replenishment of funds for subsidized loans, Reuters reported. The Nigerian had been running third, with 19 percent of the vote.] But Western members say good management, not politics, has guided their actions. One foreign director, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said bank executives were often more concerned about directing money toward their own countries than in examining projects for their return on investment."4-Jun-95,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (92%); LATIN AMERICA (79%); ARGENTINA (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); EUROPE (79%); HAITI (79%); RUSSIAN FEDERATION (72%); EASTERN EUROPE (57%); FRANCE (56%);","WITH THE arrival of James D. Wolfensohn this month, the World Bank will have at its head a man well-equipped to deal with what is arguably the most destructive economic condition hurting low- and middle-income countries -- flight capital. I'm talking about money that moves out of developing and transitional economies into Western bank accounts by means illegal or undocumented. This is not the same as Western speculative capital that flows in and out of emerging markets. That's perfectly legal. Flight capital is hot money from African, Latin American, eastern European and former Soviet countries surreptitiously passing by collusive and illicit means into New York, Miami, London, Paris, Hamburg and Swiss banks. In the process, it distorts free trade, negates foreign aid, worsens inflation, diminishes tax revenues, undermines structural adjustment, delays and imperils democracy and firmly entrenches poverty. Shouldn't a situation that has bled hundreds of billions of dollars, perhaps a half-trillion, from the world's poor receive diligent attention? Theoretically, yes, but how do you solve a problem that most political and economic leaders scarcely want to admit exists? Published financial statistics provide no reliable measure of flight capital, but privately conducted analyses indicate that its magnitude is on the order of $ 50 billion to $ 80 billion annually.  This exceeds the yearly total of foreign aid appropriations of Western governments. Furthermore, a dollar remaining in a developing economy is easily worth several dollars of external assistance. If more money comes out as flight capital than is allocated as foreign aid, and if the deleterious impact of flight capital is a multiple of sums spent on foreign aid, then something is very wrong with the way we are dealing with development issues. Flight capital has impoverished many countries and virtually destroyed others. Zaire has been squeezed back into the 19th century through the disappearance from official coffers of billions of dollars in mineral revenues and external aid. Argentina has experienced flight capital since the 1800s. South Africa suffered from a large flow of flight capital over the past decade, as political violence grew and majority rule approached. Russia has exported so much flight capital -- an estimated $ 50 billion over five years -- that it is difficult to find much evidence of the funds thus far provided by the West. Between Papa Doc, Baby Doc and the generals, Haiti has been bled dry. The list goes on. There are three principal means by which flight capital moves across borders. Black market currency deals coupled with petty smuggling is the smaller part of the problem. Official misappropriation, that is, theft by government officers is a bigger problem. When a dictator, for example Zaire's Mobutu, wants to stash money overseas, he may simply direct the central bank to effect the transfer, usually out of an offshore reserves account. A corrupt leader without dictatorial powers may use a middleman to negotiate the transaction, usually in return for some official concession or contract. Both result in depletion of the country's external reserves, enhancement of the leaders' foreign wealth -- and no questions asked by recipient Western financial institutions. At roughly $ 10 billion to $ 20 billion annually, official misappropriation is not insignificant, and this figure does not include any of the oil-rich kingdoms and sultanates where what is and isn't flight capital is rather moot. The most widely used but deeply concealed means of generating flight capital, however, is trade mispricing, a common element in international transactions. It is particularly preferred in the private sector because it is invisible and tax free. Typically, the owner or manager of a business conspires with the overseas seller of imports or buyer of exports to include an undocumented commission (""kickback,"" ""tangenti,"" ""dessous-de-table"") on the transaction, and the excess funds generated are deposited into an overseas bank account. For example, most traders dealing with Central and South America know that, more often than not, bananas come out with invoices showing less than the real price while linerboard to manufacture export cartons goes in over-invoiced. And, of course, mispricing and misappropriation frequently come together, as with a $ 7 million shipment of U.S. wheat that ended up costing Ivory Coast $ 70 million. Manipulation of trade values occurs on some 30 to 60 percent of import and export transactions of many countries, especially in Latin America and Africa. Commission levels commonly range from 5 to 15 percent. Diversion of 100 percent of the proceeds of some exports out of Russia and other republics of the former Soviet Union is especially troubling to these economies at the present time. Drainage out of poorer countries and transitional economies by the mechanism of trade mispricing alone is on the order of $ 30 billion to $ 50 billion annually. For years, World Bank and IMF officials have sold economic reform programs to poorer countries using the argument, among others, that with correct economic policies flight capital accumulated overseas will in reasonable measure flow back. To the contrary, it is evident that, once out, flight capital rarely returns. The only significant exception is Mexico, largely because it is the only Third World country bordering on a major industrialized democracy. One big reason why few people want to deal with flight capital is that blame lies with both those who generate it and those who solicit and receive it. Flight capital is cooperation among the world's powerful for exploitation of the world's weak. The fact is that for every illegal dollar, pound, franc or mark that moves out of poorer countries, there is a Western trader, manufacturer or financier that directly or indirectly facilitates its receipt. How, then, is it possible to curtail this problem, when many vested interests in richer and poorer countries prefer the status quo? Five reforms would help to ground flight capital: Require the World Bank and IMF -- and urge other international institutions and aid donors -- to strengthen provisions in their own contracts to make flight capital arising from multilateral and bilateral funding onerous and improbable. This will set a tone that will eventually affect private contracts as well. Require countries receiving World Bank and IMF funding to adopt measures that maximize the transparency of trade transactions, such as trade inspection services coupled with uncomplicated buyer/seller declarations. Removing the invisibility of kickbacks removes most kickbacks. Encourage multinational corporations worldwide to adopt policies barring over- and under-invoicing. Securing orders at the expense of the poor forestalls market growth and is in the long term self-defeating. Influence Western bankers -- at the minimum -- to cease soliciting flight capital from foreign countries. Leave bank secrecy laws in place but forego abetting the outflow of money contrary to most nations' laws. Urge Western governments -- with the United States taking the lead -- to combat official misappropriations by more readily freezing the assets of corrupt leaders in or out of office. By contrast to the rest of the developing world, the East Asian private sector has -- for reasons both civic and cultural -- participated far less frequently in illegal transfers of money into Western bank accounts. The Asian decision to keep money at home or in investments that bring profits home has given birth to sound economic policies that protect and multiply retained wealth. While trickle-down economics is at work in Asia, however, trickle-out economics is at work elsewhere. Unfortunately, the East Asian model is not at this time transferable to Africa, Latin America and former communist states. And a disservice is done to other countries by blithely ignoring that flight capital is an overarching reality for much of the globe. Addressing this problem in a sustained manner can correct a serious distortion in the global economy, maximize the benefit of declining foreign aid expenditures and within a reasonable time reverse the course of poverty's growth. Raymond Baker, director of Overecho Associates, has worked extensively on development issues in Latin America, Asia and Africa."6-Jul-95,SOUTH AFRICA (99%); AFRICA (98%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%); EGYPT (88%); GHANA (79%); BURKINA FASO (79%); KENYA (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); MALI (79%); GUINEA (79%); FRANCE (75%);,"At the turn of the century, Cecil Rhodes, one of this country's early statesmen-tycoons, dreamed of building a railroad from Cape Town to Cairo. He never realized his vision. Succeeding where Rhodes fell short, a South African entrepreneur, Hans Harwinkels, is linking the far corners of the continent with microwave signals instead of steel. In little more than two years, he has built a pay-for-view satellite-television empire whose programming is beamed from South Africa to Egypt and 40 countries in between. ""African countries have been liberalizing their markets, and this has allowed us to push north, east and west with pretty good speed,"" said Mr. Harwinkels, chief executive officer of the entertainment broadcaster Multichoice. Multichoice has a lot of company. With apartheid dead, South Africa's pent-up entrepreneurial energy is exploding all over Africa. South African industry is rushing in to build railroads in Zaire, sink mines in Ghana, put up hotels in Kenya and provide the entire continent with enough jets and telephone lines to help revitalize its sagging economy. South African trade with the rest of Africa is booming, with exports up 50 percent in two years to nearly $2.5 billion in 1994 and imports tripling to $664 million from $220 million. South Africa's expanding presence is displacing much of the economic and cultural influence long wielded by France and the United States. Economists say the trend is accelerating, with important implications for the future of a continent that many in the West have written off as hopelessly poor and corrupt. ""Our politicians may not have fully grasped this, but for our business people it is fully realized that the rest of Africa is our hinterland,"" said Erich Leistner, an economist at the Africa Institute in Pretoria, a private research group. ""Already, 25 percent of our manufactured goods go to our neighbors. We are going to become more and more involved, from railways to airlines, from mining and water supply to power, and the politics will just have to follow."" To some, it is ironic that post-apartheid South Africa's impact on the rest of the continent is more economic than political. When President Nelson Mandela took power last year, some supporters abroad expected him to become a bold force for political change, denouncing human-rights abuses and promoting democratic movements elsewhere in Africa. Instead, he has kept a low profile, making it clear South Africa does not want to play big brother to its neighbors. The emissaries of South African capitalism, by contrast, seem to be everywhere. Representatives of South Africa's huge mining industry are crowding the hotels of West African capitals in a race to tap rich new mineral markets. The mining companies are prospecting for deposits and contracts in Zaire, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali and several other countries in West Africa. Just last month, for example, the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company announced it was teaming up with a Ghanaian mining company to take over a formerly Soviet-run gold, silver and platinum mine at Kalana, in southern Mali. Companies in other industries are also extending their reach: *South African hotel companies are investing in tourism ventures in Kenya, Tanzania and other East African countries. Protea Hotels has taken over ownership or management of 82 hotels in 11 countries as far afield as Tanzania and Egypt. ""We began discussions in some of these countries as long as six years ago, when there was still a lot of distrust of us,"" said Otto Stehlik, executive chairman of the company. ""Now we have a good laugh about the way we talked to each other."" *South African Airways has begun hiring out management, maintenance and supply services to airlines in Tanzania and Uganda and has opened discussions with others in Malawi, Namibia and Zambia. And South African airplane brokers are selling used aircraft all over the continent to African carriers too poor to buy new jets. *South African telephone companies are bidding to overhaul national networks with new fiber optic lines or cellular systems. NZ Telecoms Ltd. has been modernizing phone services in Botswana, for example, and Telkom is prospecting for contracts in several countries. *The electricity company Eskom is rehabilitating the power grids of Mozambique, Angola and Lesotho, and has plans to integrate them with South Africa's electrical network. *South Africa Railways is working to upgrade the ports of Beira and Maputo in Mozambique to relieve congestion in South Africa's major seaport at Durban. *South African Breweries last year bought half of Tanzania's formerly state-owned breweries and is building a bottling plant in that country. One measure of all the commercial activity is the runaway success of Air Afrique's new route linking Johannesburg and Abidjan, capital of the West African nation of the Ivory Coast. After less than a year in service, the flights have higher occupancy rates than the Abidjan-Paris or Abidjan-New York connections. Most African countries seem to be heartily welcoming South Africa's commercial invasion, coming as it does in the face of flagging interest in the West. Several governments have even begun to advertise their World Bank-mandated privatizations of state companies in South African newspapers, hoping to find bidders in the continent's most powerful economy. South African businesses take a homey approach in negotiating with African governments: though large by African standards, they argue, they are less threatening than the American and European multinationals. And their headquarters are nearby in case of trouble. ""We want local partners and build joint ventures, and the word has been spreading in Africa that we are good people to do business with,"" said Mr. Harwinkels of Multichoice.  For France, the former colonial power that has maintained the strongest ties to the continent, all this reeks of a plot by the English-speaking business world to supplant it in Africa. The French newsletter Lettre d'Afrique recently warned of ""increasingly aggressive financial, industrial and commercial competition, in particular by Anglo-Saxons and Japanese, in league with South African firms."" Indeed, nowhere has South Africa's penetration of new markets in Africa been as spectacular as in French-speaking Zaire, formerly ruled by Belgium. As Western companies have withdrawn from Zaire in exasperation over its corruption and chaos, South African concerns have moved in, seeing its mineral wealth and huge needs for new roads and railways as economic stepping stones to the rest of the continent. Pointing to a map of central Africa in his office, the eyes of Jan van Deventer, South Africa's Ambassador to Zaire, light up as he speaks, Rhodes-like, of South African companies restoring the Lubumbashi-to-Kananga line in Zaire, a project under way, and of building lines linking that line with the towns of Kalemie and Kindu, a project under consideration. Taken together, these undertakings would link South Africa by modern rail with every country of the continent as far north as Tanzania, replacing costly truck routes and slow-moving lake barges. Big South African mining companies are also moving into Zaire. Since De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. got involved in a diamond-mining project known as Birim River in Ghana 14 months ago, production has soared 55 percent. Other mining companies are hoping to resuscitate Zaire's dying copper industry, once the world's largest. The Anglo American Corporation of South Africa said it was considering taking a major stake in the Tinke Fugurume copper mine in southern Zaire. And an international consortium that includes Anglo American, the Engelhard Corporation of the United States, Fimalac of France and Swipco of Switzerland is reportedly negotiating to take control of Zaire's state-owned Gecamines, once the world's largest copper and cobalt mine. South African companies are also eyeing Zaire's huge hydroelectric potential. Mr. van Deventer, the South African Ambassador, sees almost limitless opportunity in Zaire and the rest of sub-Sahara Africa. ""You are talking about being able to get South African consumer goods to African markets, where there is a strong demand for them, and evacuating African minerals to South African markets, where we have considerable expertise,"" he said. ""If you've been to Kasai you could cry to see that they don't grow much of anything in some of the best farmlands in the continent,"" he said. ""If Zaire could get its logging industry going, we could take quite a bit of that production. But first you have to be able to get there."" But for South Africa to take full advantage of opportunities like these, experts in regional affairs say, it will have to begin engaging the rest of Africa politically far more than it has done so far. Under Mr. Mandela, South Africa has shied away from peace-keeping tasks in places like Angola and Rwanda, hoping to avoid being cast in the role of savior. Critics of this approach say that as much as they can understand a desire to avoid becoming the bearer of all of Africa's burdens, Mr. Mandela should use his immense prestige to foster stability and democratic change in Africa. Of Africa's leaders, only Zimbabwe's President, Robert Mugabe, has been received here on a state visit. And earlier this year, officials in many African countries were surprised when South Africa declined to join the African Development Bank, a regional lending institution. Although President Mandela made a brief stopover in Nigeria last year to plea for the release of the jailed winner of elections there, Moshood K. Abiola, his Government has been mostly quiet about the political crisis there and in Zaire. ""High-profile people like Mandela should be spending as much time in African capitals as in Europe and America,"" said Tom Lodge, a political scientist at the University of Witswatersrand. ""At the end of the day, we are not going to get much from Washington, or Paris or London. This is where the future lies.""

In addition, the government insists that it did not annul the June 1993 presidential election, which was to return the nation to civilian rule. And one more thing: Nigerians snared in wrongdoing abroad are not really Nigerians. They are posing as Nigerians because they long to be identified with West Africa's most powerful country. With a blitz of revisionist history, Nigeria's military has undertaken to combat international outrage after it executed nine opponents, including playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa, last month. The campaign has included a video titled ""Not in Our Character,"" a flurry of rallies -- including a Million Man March -- and creation of a 50-man committee whose main task is to buff Nigeria's image. Those in power ""engage in a total distortion of facts,"" said Nosa Igiebor, editor of Tell, an opposition magazine. ""They portray themselves as victims, and they actually believe that. All of this is supposed to be a substitute for substantive changes."" Such campaigns are nothing new to the estimated 100 million people of Nigeria. During nearly three decades in power, military rulers repeatedly have fashioned similar efforts to fight foreign critics. The most recent was the War on Indiscipline and Corruption that Gen. Sani Abacha launched after taking power in late 1993. But that effort did little to distract foreign governments and human rights groups, who continued to lambaste the regime as one of sub-Saharan Africa's most abusive and corrupt. That criticism reached a zenith last month after Abacha's Provisional Ruling Council confirmed death sentences on Saro-Wiwa and the others, convicted in connection with the slayings of four traditional leaders last year. The nine were hanged 10 days after their trial ended. Threats of sanctions that accompanied the resulting international anger goaded Nigeria into its propaganda war, the centerpiece being a huge pro-government demonstration earlier this month. Dubbed Nigeria's version of the Louis Farrakhan-led Million Man March on Washington in October, it featured hundreds of thousands of Nigerians descending on Abuja, the federal capital. Officials maintained that the march was planned by ordinary citizens, although the government arranged for the participants to fly free to the capital, provided food money and placards and promised some demonstrators up to $ 50. Many demonstrators admitted they did not comprehend their placards; some held them upside down. Nigeria has made the United States and Britain primary targets of such rallies. Nigeria's most severe Western critics, they threatened stiff sanctions and recalled their ambassadors after the executions. ""America wants to control us,"" said Walter Ofonagoro, the minister of information and culture, during a session with foreign reporters this month. ""The Cold War is over, so they think we have to obey whatever they tell us."" Ofonagoro, Ivy League-educated, described a ""secret trade war"" that he said the United States is waging against Nigeria. As for the persistent perception that the country's military rulers annuled the 1993 vote, ""The courts canceled the election,"" he said. The reported winner, businessman Moshood Abiola, was imprisoned. ""The judge said the vote was rife with irregularities. It was not a free and fair election,"" said Ofonagoro. In fact, then-ruler Ibrahim Babangida, who had repeatedly pushed back the vote, wiped out the election, charging that the proceedings were a fraud. The action prompted the United States to halt aid. Nigeria's rulers also are scrambling to cleanse the image of Nigerians living abroad. In recent years, hundreds have been arrested on drug charges and for engaging in fraudulent schemes, making many countries wary of awarding them visas. But in the video ""Not in Our Character,"" Col. Ike Nwosu suggested that there has been a mistake. ""What has happened,"" the colonel said, ""is that people want to associate themselves with being Nigerians, with the result that when they want to engage in nefarious activities they use Nigeria as a cover."" The video, which purports to provide historical context for Nigeria's economic and social crises, acknowledges that the nation is far from perfect but asserts that malfeasance and corruption are ""not in our character."" The video blames economic woes on ""internationally imposed economic policies,"" a slap at World Bank and International Monetary Fund efforts to help Nigeria right its economy during the 1980s. The video also assails foreign governments for criticizing Nigeria's stumbling attempts to establish democracy, calling such nations ""disingenuous and dishonest."" The narrator insists that it took the United States and Britain ""centuries . . . to produce viable liberal democratic institutions."" Ultimately, the narrator says, ""most of the problems that confront Nigeria today are rooted in our colonial history."" Nigeria gained its independence from Britain in 1960; the military has held power for most of the time since then. The propaganda efforts stretch down to an area of southern Nigeria known as Ogoniland, the oil-rich region of Saro-Wiwa and the others executed. Officials in Rivers state, where Ogoniland sits, have invited reporters in to investigate accusations by members of the indigenous Ogoni ethnic group. The Ogonis contend that a rush to extract oil had resulted in environmental devastation of their homeland and that they had been deprived of any economic benefits deriving from the oil production. In an interview, Col. Dauda Musa Komo, the Rivers state administrator, said the government ""is not in a defensive mood. . . . We just want people to know the facts."" Later he added that ""military-bashing has become a fashionable thing. . . . But there is no truth in the accusation that the military [are in charge] just because they want power."" Igiebor, the magazine editor, said of the government's public relations effort, ""Ordinary Nigerians are not moved by these shenanigans."""29-Jan-96,KENYA (99%); AFRICA (93%); EASTERN AFRICA (93%); UGANDA (92%); UNITED STATES (79%);,"When President Daniel arap Moi flew to Uganda last week for talks with other East African leaders, he traveled in luxury aboard a brand-new private jet that the taxpayers of this cash-strapped country bought last month for about $50 million. As the jet lifted off from the airport, it banked over the rutted and potholed two-lane highway from Nairobi to Mombasa, Kenya's major port. A vital artery for business, the road is perhaps the most visible symbol of the dilapidated state of the country's infrastructure. On good days, the going is bumpy. On rainy days the road is impassable. Some opposition leaders and diplomats here assert that the jet and the road illustrate what is wrong with the Government's economic priorities: a longstanding tendency among politicians to let personal prestige outweigh the public interest. President Moi purchased the jet, a sleek Dutch-made Fokker, at the same time that his Government was seeking a $50 million low-interest loan from the World Bank to repair the road. Since newspapers disclosed the purchase of the jet in November, Government officials have argued that the expense is justified because in the past the President has had to take one of Kenya Airway's two jets out of service every time he travels. The airplane is one of several expenditures not listed in Kenya's budget that have jeopardized aid from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, as well as from other countries, diplomats and officials at international development banks said. The officials and diplomats, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the jet and two other budget-busting projects of questionable worth have come up during talks this week between the Government and a joint mission from the Bank and the I.M.F. The two sides are trying to hammer out a plan for economic reform that would allow the I.M.F. to release hundreds of millions of dollars in blocked aid. The stakes are high for Kenya, an economic engine for eastern Africa. Hanging in the balance are $200 million in direct aid from the I.M.F. and nearly $166 million in loans from the World Bank for roads and other infrastructure projects that are needed to attract foreign investment. The talks are also being watched by Western countries, including the United States, and several have said the I.M.F.'s decision will be a bellwether for them. Only a fraction of the $800 million donor countries pledged to Kenya in November 1994 has been disbursed because of the stalled negotiations, diplomats said. Neither the I.M.F. nor the World Bank would comment on the talks. But diplomats and people familiar with the talks say the main sticking points have been the Government's inability to stamp out official corruption and the kind of pork-barrel and prestige spending typified by the President's new airplane. Besides the jet, the Government is spending about $85 million to build an international airport at Eldoret, the heart of the President's home state in eastern Kenya. Parliament never approved the project -- the money was tucked away in a special debt service fund in this year's spending plan. It was also hidden from World Bank auditors who scrutinized the budget until a newspaper reported its existence. The Government has argued that the airport is needed because of an economic boom in the area. The growth there has been fueled in large part by flower merchants, who now truck their goods to Nairobi, over pitted roads, for air shipment to Europe. In another deal done without competitive bidding or legislative approval, the Government recently awarded a multi-million-dollar contract to a French company to manufacture identification cards. Paradoxically, the controversies over the airport and the jet come to light as Kenya has made big strides over the last three years toward improving its moribund economy. Last week, the Government suspended a score of high-ranking port officials on corruption charges. Urged by the I.M.F., it has also eliminated import licenses, squeezed the money supply and liberalized trade. As a result, interest rates are down, and the economy grew by 5 percent in 1995, after several years of stagnation. Inflation, which had hit 100 percent in 1993, stayed below 7 percent in 1995. But the population continues to grow faster than the economy, local economists said. So Kenyans, with an average annual income of $1,200, are in reality getting poorer. ""It's a mixed bag,"" said one diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""They would not have achieved what they achieved last year if they hadn't been doing certain things right. But the question is, would they have had 8 percent growth without the corruption."""13-Feb-96,NIGERIA (95%); UNITED STATES (92%); EUROPE (79%);,"When members of the Ogoni people began attacks three years ago on Royal Dutch/Shell's oilfields in Nigeria, the company appealed to the country's military Government for protection. The results, senior company officials now acknowledge, were utterly disastrous. To crush the unrest by the Ogoni, who complained of environmental damage to their territories and demanded money for the oil extracted there, Nigeria sent its notoriously brutal ""mobile police"" and mounted a campaign of repression that included laying waste to whole villages. Last November the military Government of Gen. Sani Abacha executed the most prominent Ogoni, Ken Saro-Wiwa, after he was found guilty of inciting a riot that led to the killing of four pro-Government chiefs. His trial was widely condemned as a sham in Europe and the United States. Now, Royal Dutch/Shell is on trial in the court of public opinion. Critics here and abroad accuse the company of colluding in the brutal oppression of local people, of polluting Ogoniland and of failing to speak out against the execution of Mr. Saro-Wiwa. Several countries, including the United States, are contemplating sanctions against Nigeria. A coalition of human rights and environmental groups is planning a worldwide boycott of Shell's gasoline and other products. Even London's Royal Geographic Society, not usually the most militant of groups, has dropped the company as a patron and returned a $60,000 donation. The Saro-Wiwa case has set off a debate reminiscent of the one over economic relations with South Africa before majority rule. Some critics of the Nigerian Government say that by refusing to cooperate with it, companies like Shell could hasten the return of democracy, or at least avoid complicity with corruption and denial of human rights. An examination of Shell's actions in Nigeria, assembled from interviews with officials of Shell and the Nigerian Government as well as dissidents and human rights groups abroad, from separate tours of Ogoniland with officials and dissidents, and from a review of official and corporate documents, brings out these broad points: *Although Mr. Saro-Wiwa has been widely portrayed as a gentle, pipe-smoking eco-martyr, he was a far more complex figure, an ambitious -- Ogoni political rivals say ruthless -- leader. His movement focused on ecological protection after calculating that this would have appeal in the West, but its main goals were to win the region autonomous power and a share of its oil revenues. *Nigeria's leaders saw the Ogoni movement as a step toward separatist war, like the fierce conflict over the Biafra region in the 1960's. The response was ferocious. One internal Nigerian Army memo outlining the Government's strategy called for the ""wasting"" of ""leadership cadres, especially vocal individuals."" *Shell gave Nigeria an important pretext for violence when it specifically asked the Government to send the mobile police -- known locally as the ""kill-and-go mob."" Shell paid for the transportation and salary bonuses of some troops -- ostensibly oilfield guards -- who committed the abuses. *There is evidence of significant pollution in the region in which Shell has pumped oil, but it is not as dire as portrayed by Shell's critics. A 1995 World Bank study concluded that while the pollution angers local residents, the impact on human health ""is not expected to be substantial."" The report added that ""given the low environmental and health impacts, the actual future benefits of reducing oil pollution are low."" *Shell, despite the urging of Western diplomats, declined until the last moment to lend its voice to the international campaign for clemency after Mr. Saro-Wiwa was convicted of murder in a secret and clearly rigged trial. But it is far from clear that Shell's influence would have saved the writer and fellow activists hanged with him. Shell officials fervently deny doing anything more than trying to protect company personnel and equipment and say they had no control over the actions of the Nigerian security services. They said it was not unusual for companies seeking protection to pay transportation costs and salary supplements for troops living outside their barracks. ""We were not there,"" said Egbert Imomoh, Shell's top manager in Port Harcourt. ""We don't know what happened."" Shell officials say they have begun a major study to assess environmental damage in the region. But senior company officials said Shell's image had been dealt a serious blow by the events in Nigeria. ""Saro-Wiwa's execution was a disaster for us,"" said Alan Detheridge, Shell's West African coordinator. Nonetheless, the company brushes aside suggestions that it should pull out of Nigeria, or at least freeze the $3.8 billion natural gas project it is pursuing there. The World Bank announced soon after the executions of Mr. Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni activists that it would not proceed with negotiations to provide money for some of the project. ""All we can pull out are our 270 expatriate staff,"" said Mark Moody-Stuart, one of four managing directors of Royal Dutch/Shell, in an interview in his London office. ""The Nigerians can run the oil industry on their own and buy help on the market,"" he said, adding that ""the French would replace us in a flash."" The Roots Big Profits, Political Rivalry For nearly four decades Shell has been pumping oil in Nigeria's delta region, to its own enormous profit, and to the benefit of Western countries that have been ready customers. Shell produces roughly half of Nigeria's oil, a commodity that accounts for some 90 percent of the country's foreign exchange and a steady stream of revenues for Nigeria that have often been siphoned off by corrupt officials. The operations are strategically important to the company, which lacks enough reserves of high-quality crude to meet the requirements of its refineries and gasoline stations. Shell takes for itself 257,000 barrels of the 900,000 barrels the company pumps daily, giving Nigeria the rest. Nigeria is also lucrative for Shell. Nick Antill, an analyst with the London securities house Barclays de Zoete Wedd, puts Shell's Nigerian profits at $170 million to $190 million a year. ""That's nearly 10 percent of total exploration and production profits, which is significant,"" he says. Little, if any, of these profits trickled down to Ogoniland. The Ogoni campaign against the company began in 1990 when a group of conservative traditional leaders formed the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People to win statehood, more money and better environmental protection for the Ogoni. Garrick B. Leton, a former federal minister, became the first president. Mr. Saro-Wiwa, then 49 and a successful writer and TV producer, was appointed spokesman. The movement persuaded the Government to create an Oil and Minerals Producing Areas Development Commission to channel money to these regions, with an initial promise it would get 3 percent of Nigeria's $10 billion annual oil income, later raised to 13 percent. But Mr. Saro-Wiwa favored a more confrontational approach to Shell and the federal Government, Mr. Leton said in an interview at his spacious Port Harcourt house. And the two men fell out in a dispute over tactics tinged with class rivalry and personality differences. The movement was founded by ""rich traditional leaders with big houses in Port Harcourt,"" said Botom Mitee, a supporter of Mr. Saro-Wiwa whose brother was also tried for murder but acquitted. But Mr. Saro-Wiwa, though he had grown affluent during his years as a local administrator and trader, ""identified with poor Ogoni in the villages."" Against its official leaders' wishes, Mr. Saro-Wiwa set up new branches of the group under his control, including a youth wing called the National Youth Council of the Ogoni People. Leadership of this group won Mr. Saro-Wiwa a following among Ogoni impatient with traditional leaders. But Mr. Leton said the group became Mr. Saro-Wiwa's ""private vigilante army."" At Mr. Saro-Wiwa's urging, the movement demanded $10 billion in oil royalties and enviromental compensation from Shell and the Government in December 1992. Shell attributes Mr. Saro-Wiwa's success in gradually taking control of the movement and radicalizing it to the continuing poverty of the Ogoni, as promises of more federal aid never materialized. Most villagers still lack even electricity and piped water. For this, Shell blames the Government. In 1992 Mr. Saro-Wiwa allied the Ogoni movement with the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, a group based in The Hague that strives to give minority groups access to international organizations. He carried his campaign to the United Nations and canvassed support in Europe and the United States. He designed an Ogoni flag, wrote a national anthem and began signing his letters as ""president and spokesman of the Ogoni people."" The struggle for control of the Ogoni movement between its traditional leaders and Mr. Saro-Wiwa came to a head in June 1993 over his plan to draw attention to the Ogoni plight by boycotting a Nigerian presidential election that was supposed to mark the country's return to democratic rule. Mr. Letun and other founding fathers of the movement opposed the boycott, were outvoted and resigned, allowing Mr. Saro-Wiwa to take over the group's presidency. Mr. Saro-Wiwa's campaign against Shell and the federal Government angered Nigeria's military leaders, who said they feared he was stirring up secessionist feeling in the oil-rich east, 20 years after Biafra's unsuccessful breakaway bid. The Violence Countercharges And Confusion In late 1992 Shell asked the Government to send troops to protect its operations from recurring vandalism. But dismayed by continuing vigilante attacks and the ferocious crackdown, Shell withdrew from the region in early 1993, asking the authorities to protect the installations left behind. The violence continued. Soon after Shell left, an oil pumping station here was set afire and destroyed, and the other four stations in Ogoniland were damaged. Ogoni leaders and the military accuse each other of being responsible. The blazing oil left behind a landscape of charred trees and blackened earth. Even today, nothing grows. The next year, according to an internal memo obtained by Nigerian dissidents, the company specifically asked the military Government to deploy its mobile police. What happened in those months of upheaval is a matter of deep dispute. The Government, in its official account, asserts that vigilantes with ties to Mr. Saro-Wiwa's youth group spearheaded attacks against Shell installations and murdered 40 Ogoni opponents. Mr. Saro-Wiwa's brother, Owens Saro-Wiwa, and a report by a delegation from the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization to Ogoniland in Febuary 1995 give very different accounts of these incidents. Owens Saro-Wiwa acknowledges that vigilante lawlessness existed in 1993. But he says most of the vandalism was carried out by soldiers, who stole generators and corrugated iron sheets for profit during their campaign against the Ogoni. Internal military documents show the Government hoped that by crushing the Ogoni protests it would persuade Shell to resume operations in the region. In May 1994 the commander of an internal security task force, Maj. Paul Okuntimo, wrote to his superior, Lieut. Col. Dauda Komo, the Military Administrator of Rivers State, which includes Ogoniland. The message, later obtained by dissidents, said ""Shell operations still impossible unless ruthless military operations are undertaken."" It called for ""wasting targets cutting across communities and leadership cadres, especially vocal individuals."" It detailed special allowances for the troops and suggested applying ""pressure on oil companies"" to help pay the costs of the operation. Owens Saro-Wiwa estimates that the attacks largely destroyed about 30 Ogoni villages, killing some 2,000 people, although there is no independent verification. By then Shell had already abandoned its operations in the region, declaring that it was unwilling to work in conditions of civil unrest and military oppression. Mr. Detheridge, Shell's West African coordinator, said the company would not return ""until we have the local community on our side."" On May 21, 1994, Nigerian security forces detained Ken Saro-Wiwa in the Gokana region of Ogoniland while he was campaigning for election to a constitutional conference and took him to Port Harcourt. The Government says Mr. Saro-Wiwa told his youth supporters, in a statement that included a reference to the paramount chief's meeting place: ""The vultures who connived with the security forces to stop me from addressing you are now meeting at the Gbenemene's Palace Hall in Giokoo sharing money sent them by the federal Government in an effort to thwart my bid for the constitutional conference. Go to the meeting place and deal with the vultures."" His supporters say Mr. Saro-Wiwa never made that statement, though they concede that he used similar language several months earlier. According to the Government, a crowd of several hundred Ogoni youths attacked the small meeting hall where chiefs and elders were gathered, massacring four with rakes, iron bars, stones and planks. Today the slain chiefs' blood is still splattered on the walls and floor, which is littered with stones and chunks of concrete used to crush their skulls. The burnt-out remains of two of their cars are slowly being swallowed up by vegetation outside. The four murdered men -- Albert T. Badey, a former secretary to the state government, Chief Edward Kobani, Chief Samuel M. Orage and Chief Theophalos B. Orage -- were on a list of 10 ""vultures"" that Mr. Saro-Wiwa made public the previous October because of what he said was their opposition to his agressive campaigning for Ogoni rights against Shell. The Government insists that Mr. Saro-Wiwa and eight others incited the murders. Mr. Saro-Wiwa's supporters say the killing was done by Government agents to incriminate the Ogoni leader. What few outside the Nigerian Government disagree about is that Mr. Saro-Wiwa's trial was a travesty, its outcome preordained and his sentence more a reflection of Nigeria's harsh politics than any judicial process. Mr. Saro-Wiwa was tried before a mixed military-civilian court with no right of judicial appeal. Two prosecution witnesses later retracted evidence and said the Government bribed them. Mr. Saro-Wiwa was hanged on Nov. 10. Nineteen more Ogoni are awaiting trial for the same killings. The Responsibility A Lost Cause From the Start? Critics of Shell contend the company has considerable influence over the Nigerian Government and could have done much more to prevent the hanging. The company disputes both assertions. Initially, when Mr. Saro-Wiwa was put on trial, Shell refused to intervene with the Nigerian authorities, saying ""the company does not get involved in politics."" In a statement issued last Oct. 31, after Mr. Saro-Wiwa was sentenced to death, Shell acknowledged that it was being pressed to use its influence to secure clemency but declined to do so, saying, ""It is not for commercial organizations like Shell to interfere in the legal process of a sovereign state such as Nigeria."" The company also implicitly accused Mr. Saro-Wiwa of supporting violence, saying in a statement at the time of sentencing that while the Ogoni movement claimed to be nonviolent, ""this is not our experience."" Shell's stance brought protests from Mr. Saro-Wiwa's friends. And on Nov. 2 the company issued a new statement that omitted the accusation of abetting violence. But it expressed no regret at the death sentences and again refused to intervene. Only after Mr. Saro-Wiwa's appeal for clemency had been denied did Shell's chief executive officer, Cor Herkstroter, fax General Abacha requesting a pardon. Mr. Detheridge insists that Shell's relationship with Nigeria has to be based on business considerations, not political ones. ""We can offer advice and we can point out the consequences of an action,"" he said. ""But we do not lecture or try to give orders because we do not interfere in politics and government."" Owens Saro-Wiwa says he met three times during the trial with Brian Anderson, Shell's top executive in Nigeria. He quoted Mr. Anderson as saying it would be ""difficult but not impossible"" to get his brother freed, provided the Ogoni movement called off its campaign against the company. But he said his brother refused this offer, replying that the campaign against Shell would end once he was free and the company agreed to negotiate with the movement. Mr. Anderson then broke off contact with him, Owens Saro-Wiwa says. In a videotaped interview issued by Shell, Mr. Anderson denies ever having made such an offer, but confirms that he met with the condemned man's brother. Britain and the United States privately urged Shell to help save Mr. Saro-Wiwa. Mr. Moody-Stewart of Shell said, ""Of course we pointed out to Nigerians the risk of sanctions."" On Nov. 8, the day General Abacha rejected Mr. Saro-Wiwa's clemency plea, President Clinton's special envoy to Nigeria, Ambassador Donald T. McHenry, urged executives of American companies with interests in Nigeria to apply one form of leverage that he thought might work: to explain to Nigeria's leaders that carrying out the executions could invite international sanctions. While Mr. McHenry says he does not know whether the companies followed his advice, some of them, including the American oil companies Mobil and Chevron, say they did warn their partners about the international repercussions of proceeding with the hangings. American and British diplomats in Lagos as well as a senior Nigerian diplomat said the campaign to save Mr. Saro-Wiwa never had much chance. The military, they said, was adamantly unwilling to bow to foreign pressure a second time so soon after General Abacha spared the former head of state Olusegun Obasanjo from execution for conspiracy in May. ""The military are a macho bunch,"" said the Nigerian diplomat. ""They couldn't give way a second time. The two incidents were too close in time. If they had been further apart we might have saved him."" The Pollution Low Standards, A Few Regrets Sitting in his comfortable top-floor office at Shell Center on the south bank of the River Thames with 17th-century naval paintings on the wall and a view of the Houses of Parliament, Mr. Moody-Stuart said he was not sure whether anything could have been done to avert the hanging. But he does says the whole crisis in Ogoniland could have been avoided. ""What I regret is that we did not launch our Niger River Delta Environmental Survey six or seven years ago,"" he said. He added that if there had been an agreed analysis and action program when the Ogoni movement was founded, ""it would have taken a lot of heat out of Ken Saro-Wiwa's campaign."" Shell is now setting up such a commission, at a cost of $4.5 million, to assess the delta's environmental needs. But the project is off to a shaky start. In November Prof. Claude Ake, a representative of the delta communities, resigned in protest at the executions and because he doubts the commission's impartiality. Ogoni activists like to describe how, after four decades of oil pumping, their 400-square-mile ancestral land is host to 96 oil wells and five big pumping stations, where vast quantities of natural gas are burned 24 hours a day, dirtying the air and lighting up the countryside. They complain of leaky oil pipes crisscrossing their land and hindering farming. They complain, too, of frequent oil spills that destroy crops and pollute the creeks where the Ogoni fish. While calling this an exaggerated picture, Shell concedes that environmental standards at its oilfields in the Niger delta are lower than in Europe or America. ""It's a question of priorities,"" said Dick van den Broek. ""Nigeria is a poor country. How much should it spend on enviromental protection?"" As majority partner, the Nigerian Government must pay 55 percent of all environmental spending, Shell points out, and it has been reluctant to sacrifice profits for costly environmental protection. Mr. Saro-Wiwa indicated a keen awareness of the international political appeal of environmental issues in his last book, ""A Month and a Day: A Detention Diary,"" saying of a visit to America: ""What that trip did was to convince me that the environment would have to be a strong plank on which to base the burgeoning Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People."" Neither Shell nor the Nigerian Government has conducted a comprehensive environmental impact study of its operations in Ogoniland or elsewhere in the Niger delta. A 1995 World Bank study, ""Defining an Environmental Strategy for the Niger Delta,"" concludes that while the oil industry has caused environmental damage, ""oil pollution by itself is of moderate priority when compared with the full spectrum of environmental problems in the Niger Delta."" Many of these, it says, stem from a fourfold population rise since 1958. The study cited oil leaks into the delta waters, saying they indicate ""poor or no treatment of effluents"" by Shell and other oil companies. Many Ogoni leaders say their main complaint is poverty. ""Backwardness is what is wrong with us,"" says Charles Kpakol, chairman of the Gokana local government council, one of three Ogoni regional authorities. While appointed by the Government and opposed to Mr. Saro-Wiwa's Ogoni movement, he is still critical of the federal Government for spending too little in Ogoniland. A chart on Tuesday with an article about accusations that Royal Dutch/ Shell had condoned a Nigerian Government crackdown against members of the Ogoni people misstated the volume of Nigeria's oil production. It is 1.8 million barrels a day, not 1.8 billion.  An article on Feb. 13 about the role of Royal Dutch/Shell in Nigeria misstated actions of the Royal Geographical Society in London. While some of its members urged the society in January to sever its links to Shell as a corporate patron, the society has not broken ties or returned any Shell donations.

Soglo has gone the last few days, whether pressing the flesh in roadside campaign stops or dancing briefly during a festival in the coastal city of Ouidah, he has been eagerly greeted by supporters with cries of ""five more years."" But what makes Mr. Soglo's run for re-election extraordinary in a continent where 18 or more national elections will be held this year -- the most since the dawn of African independence from European colonialism nearly 40 years ago -- is not its infectious, feel-good atmosphere. Instead, in contrast to scores of rigged presidential votes on this continent since the late 1950's, no one here is sure what the final outcome of Sunday's election will be. In fact, no one knows whether the incumbent, who faces six rival candidates, will even survive the first round. If Mr. Soglo were to lose, it would be virtually the first time a sitting president has lost power at the ballot box in sub-Saharan Africa, other than the historic election that ended white minority rule in South Africa in 1994. In countries like Central African Republic, Madagascar and Congo, sitting presidents lost elections only after being stripped of most of their powers. That power is truly at stake is not the only novelty here either. In a continent long bedeviled by ethnic rivalries, Benin has been able to put them aside. Instead, the campaign has focused to a great degree on issues that would seem more familiar to Westerners: The candidates have debated the role of the state in shaping the economy, how much should be spent for social services, and the appropriate role for the president's family in the life of the nation. ""They are all running on fairly straightforward questions,"" one Western diplomat said. ""Privatize, don't privatize, more of this, less of that. It is really rather remarkably about the issues."" For its size, this tiny country of 5.5 million people has had a striking record of setting examples for its far larger neighbors. And many observers from both the outside world and elsewhere in West Africa, where a wave of democratization that began at the start of the decade appears to be petering out, are eagerly watching how Sunday's vote will turn out. In the past 30 years, Benin seems to have been near the head of the political curve for Africa. A military coup here in 1963, led by one of Mr. Soglo's uncles, was one of the first of many army takeovers that transformed Africa's political landscape in the early independence years and for years made Benin one of the continent's most unstable states. A Marxist-Leninist dictatorship was established in 1972 by Mr. Soglo's principal electoral opponent, the retired general Matthieu Kerekou. That made Benin one of the continent's first communist states. Benin set its latest precedent in 1990 when it organized the so-called National Conference, which peacefully stripped General Kerekou of his powers after 17 years of ruinous, repressive rule. It appointed Mr. Soglo, a veteran World Bank official, as interim Prime Minister, and set the stage for the country's first democratic, multiparty elections in 1991, which Mr. Soglo won. One by one, this country's neighbors -- Mali, Niger, Congo and Central Africa Republic -- began organizing democratic transitions modeled on Benin's experience. Longtime dictatorships were swept from power in all of these countries. However, the reform process began faltering when governments that were strong allies of France in countries like Gabon and Ivory Coast pre-empted calls for national conferences by holding multiparty elections that international observers widely regarded as rigged. Since then, many of Africa's elections -- like one last week in Equatorial Guinea that President Obiang Nguema won with 99 percent of the vote -- have been cynical affairs. These votes are intended to give entrenched dictators a veneer of respectability while exposing the leadership to little or no political risk. Other elections, like one just held in Sierra Leone, have taken place in the midst of long-running civil wars and have been watched over by armies reluctant to surrender power to civilians. ""In Benin we have democratic institutions that have been functioning for five years, including a Constitutional Court that has already proven its autonomy and an independent electoral commission that is unique in francophone Africa,"" said Christopher Fomunyoh, director for West Africa of the National Democratic Institute, a private American organization that promotes democracy. ""This is going to be a true test of whether these institutions can survive and grow, encouraging other countries to take the democratic path established by Benin, or whether there will be a rollback,"" said Mr. Fomunyoh, who is leading a delegation of 17 observers here. ""Whatever happens, Benin will be a determining factor in the intellectual discussion that is already under way about whether democracy can survive in Africa."" Since a military coup overthrew an elected Government in Niger last month, Benin has been surrounded by undemocratic neighbors -- from military-ruled Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, to even smaller Togo, where President Gnassingbe Eyadema has ruled with an iron fist and the sympathies of France for three decades. In an editorial this week, L'Horizon, a newspaper here, said of this situation, ""The Atlantic Ocean is our only sure neighbor now."" For his part, Mr. Soglo acknowledges the enmity his country's democratic turn has earned him. ""When I went to Japan for the coronation of the Emperor, another African leader, who I will not name, said to me: 'You are Soglo, the one who is creating so much disorder for Africa.' "" In an interview today in the National Palace here, Mr. Soglo, 62, said: ""I have grown used to the insults."" What is more, the President contended, neighboring countries that he would not name have been arming and training troublemakers and sending them to Benin in the last year. He said that he suspects it was such outside agitators who fired an anti-tank weapon at a newly built international conference center in November, just days before Benin was to hold a biannual summit of French-speaking nations there. Rather than back down, Mr. Soglo has made a campaign theme both of the country's democratization under his leadership and -- an even greater novelty -- his record in implementing a classic program of World Bank-style economic reforms. In many other countries where such reforms have been carried out, come election time, the leaders -- from Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe to Jerry Rawlings of Ghana -- have sought to distance themselves from the liberalizing prescriptions of international lenders and to renew their nationalist credentials. Road-building and other new construction have taken off during Mr. Soglo's tenure, transforming Cotonou, which had been a desolately sandy and potholed place. ""Soglo paid the functionaries and the functionaries, for once have been doing their work,"" said Francois Agbodo, a restaurant-owner in Ouidah. ""Before, nobody got paid and nobody worked."" But Mr. Soglo's critics have also seized upon economic issues in their campaigns. Mr. Kerekou, for example, whose socialist model during his years in office was widely considered here to have been an economic failure, has nonetheless gone on the attack, appealing to national pride to say that Mr. Soglo's privatization of bankrupt state companies has gone too far. To many observers, it appears that Mr. Kerekou's popularity derives mostly from the respect he earned for gracefully retiring from power at the demand of the 1990 National Conference and living modestly ever since. Mr. Kerekou is believed to enjoy strong support in his native northern Benin. Mr. Soglo's other main rivals, like Adrien Houngbedji, a former National Assembly president, have concentrated their criticisms on the need for social services, which these candidates say have been forgotten in the pursuit of an economic growth rate that is officially estimated at about 6 percent. Others have harped effectively on the high profile of Mr. Solgo's wife, Rosine, who enjoys a degree of influence that many compare to Hillary Rodham Clinton, and of other members of the President's family, who are often seen at official functions or who frequently do business with the state. Mr. and Mrs. Soglo often appear at state functions wearing twin outfits. The President raised eyebrows, diplomats say, at the Francophone Summit here, when he introduced his wife to 40 heads of state and government before mentioning the French leader, Jacques Chirac, whose country financed the gathering. Along with Mr. Kerekou, Mr. Houngbedji is widely considered among the most likely candidates to survive the first round and to face Mr. Soglo in a runoff two weeks later. For some observers, however, the combination of Mr. Kerekou's high name recognition and regional support and Mr. Houngbedji's effective introduction of social issues as a campaign theme make it uncertain that the President himself can survive the first round. The President's party, Benin Renaissance, lost control of the National Assembly last year. ""What is so refreshing here is that anything can happen in this election,"" said one European diplomat of Sunday's vote. Map of West Africa highlighting Benin: Benin has had a history of setting examples for its larger neighbors."10-Apr-96,FRANCE (98%); AFRICA (98%); WESTERN AFRICA (95%); COTE D'IVOIRE (94%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (93%); BURKINA FASO (92%); EUROPE (92%); BENIN (92%); TOGO (79%); SENEGAL (79%); NIGER (79%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%); CENTRAL AFRICA (79%); MALI (79%); EASTERN EUROPE (51%);,"Despite political turmoil and tightened international aid budgets, France's former colonies in West Africa have begun to shake off a decade of economic doldrums, benefiting from a temporary combination of good luck and monetary reform. World commodity prices rose suddenly in 1994, boosting economies greatly dependent on exports of cocoa, rubber, cotton, tropical woods and other primary products. As a result, seven former French West African colonies -- Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo -- posted average gross domestic product gains of 6 percent in 1995. Significantly, the economy of the group's locomotive, Ivory Coast, reversed years of recession and grew by 7 percent. These results were just what specialists predicted when France shocked 14 former sub-Saharan African colonies in January 1994 by forcing a 50 percent devaluation of their common currency -- the first realignment between the French franc and African franc since 1948. But just as specialists also had forecast, the overall performance of France's former Central African possessions was less impressive, even though they are potentially better off. No statistics on their economic performance have been issued for 1995, which experts interpret as an indication of unresolved political difficulties, bloated state payrolls and economic mismanagement. Many French-speaking African nations initially had feared the 1994 devaluation was the first step toward radical reduction of the generous aid that successive regimes in Paris had underwritten since the countries gained independence in 1960. French-speaking Africa had a record of government corruption, coups and stagnant growth, and France was confronted by its most serious economic crisis since World War II, a combination many analysts believed would lead the government of prime minister Edouard Balladur to carry out just such an agonizing reappraisal. But such fears disappeared last May when Jacques Chirac, a politician with a wide network of African friends, was elected president of France. So popular was his victory in French-speaking Africa that an Ivory Coast newspaper splashed the words ""We Won"" on its front page. Chirac single-handedly went to bat for Africa despite France's record unemployment, high interest rates and worrisome budget deficit. Alone among Western countries, France at his insistence virtually has maintained its level of assistance to the region at about $ 9 billion a year. That aid, largest among the Group of Seven industrialized democracies, is almost three times more than the slashed U.S. commitment. Last June, Chirac also forced reluctant European Union partners to renew for five years an annual $ 3.44 billion aid package for the southern hemisphere despite their preference for helping the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe, who are themselves potential EU members. In return, the EU donors insisted on closely linking aid to African countries to their respect for democratic practices, human rights and good governance. The stipulations signaled that exasperated donors were no longer routinely willing to condone the excesses of authoritarian mismanagement, dictatorial rule and human rights abuses. Although the new toughness in European aid decisions seems to have brought a measure of reform, African specialists have urged caution, pointing to some backsliding on commitments to fair elections, multi-party democracy and rigorous financial accounting. Indeed, the Rwandan government was rebuffed when it expelled 39 international humanitarian relief agencies and asked the European Union to deliver directly the tens of millions of dollars in aid money the agencies had previously administered. On the human rights front, Cameroon, a haven for extremists from Rwanda's Hutu ethnic majority, arrested Col. Theoneste Bagosera last month on charges of instigating the murder of about a half-million members of the Tutsi minority in 1994. He and 11 other former senior Rwandan officials wanted by the International War Crimes Tribunal investigating the slaughter were to be transferred to The Hague to face trial. In another example, the International Monetary Fund froze aid negotiations with Niger immediately after a military coup ousted the country's first democratically elected president in January. The EU quickly suspended its assistance. France interrupted all but humanitarian aid. The coup leaders caved in this month, agreeing to set new, democratic presidential elections for September as the price for resuming the aid. Although Chirac was initially critical of the devaluation, once in office he embraced the Balladur reforms, subordinating bilateral French aid to acceptance of IMF and World Bank reforms aimed at cutting bureaucratic fat and straightening out tangled finances. Chirac also renewed France's commitment to further democracy, first enunciated in 1990. ""The time of gifts is over,"" said a senior French specialist, explaining this year's 3 percent cutback in French aid. ""The Africans know we cannot help them on the same scale as during the past 35 years."" Officials tracking French African economies at the Paris-based Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development decry the region's lack of meaningful private capital investment. Joao Vale de Almeida, a EU spokesman dealing with Africa, said he is worried that the ""lack of a success story"" on the continent could lead to steep aid cuts when the present agreement expires in 2000. Stoking such pessimism is the failure of concerted donor efforts to force reform on France's former Central African possessions, which include the oil-producing states of Cameroon, Congo and Gabon. The Congo is potentially rich, but has mortgaged its oil revenues until 2012 and refused to reduce its bloated civil service and state corporation payrolls. The finances of Gabon are also precarious, as are those of Cameroon. All three countries have resisted full implementation of IMF reforms. In north-central Africa, Chad is only now emerging from decades of little wars, sometimes involving Libya, at other times pitting southern Bantu farmers against northern Saharan nomads. This month, a referendum approved a constitution providing for a strong presidency, in a significant step toward returning Chad to a state of law. But such a back-to-basics approach has limits, as the politics of Nigeria's tiny neighbor, Benin, demonstrated last month. One-time Marxist Mathieu Kerekou was elected president, despite a messy economic and human rights record in his 17-year reign ending in 1990."26-May-96,FRANCE (96%); CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC (95%); AFRICA (94%); CENTRAL AFRICA (94%); UNITED STATES (92%);,"BANGUI, Central African Republic, May 25 A French foreign minister in the 1970's used to be fond of saying that Africa was the last remaining place on earth where Paris could change the course of history by deploying a mere 500 soldiers. But a week after an army mutiny that turned into a cyclone of looting and protest against an unpopular Government and against French intervention, even the deployment of hundreds more French troops showed no signs of decisively tipping the balance in favor of the elected President, Ange-Felix Patasse. Today the looting moved from the city center, where nearly every business has been smashed and emptied, to the affluent neighborhoods on the banks of the Ubangi River, where most senior diplomats live. Throughout the day, canoes could be seen ferrying freshly stolen goods across the river to Zaire. French and American diplomats continued discussions today about evacuating scores of their citizens living in isolated parts of the country. Early today, thieves began ransacking American official residences and the residence of the World Bank representatives, among others, before they were chased off by patrolling troops. ""What we are seeing, unfortunately, is just a total breakdown of law and order,"" said a Western diplomat. In the devastated city center, French soldiers crouched in defensive positions behind the bullet-pocked walls of businesses destroyed in the looting while hundreds of anti-Government protesters marched today for the third day, defying a ban on public gatherings and angrily denouncing the French presence here. A bit farther down the principal road, Avenue Barthelemy Boganda, rebellious soldiers, called FACA, or Armed Forces of Central Africa, stayed close to huge mango trees with their automatic weapons in case of an assault on their positions. Not far from the international airport, next to France's Central African air base here, another march was organized this morning. This one, in favor of the Government, drew a somewhat smaller crowd, and lacked the fervor of the anti-Government demonstration. Sentiment here seemed to weigh heavily against a leader whose tenure has been marked by incompetence and corruption. Many workers here have gone unpaid for months. Many people now blame the President for the deaths of at least a dozen mutinous soldiers and an undetermined number of others at the hands of French troops who swooped into action here on Wednesday. ""What is tolerable in ordinary times becomes intolerable when people are hungry and they are not receiving their salaries,"" said one civil servant, explaining the outburst of popular anger that has destroyed much of this city. ""When this happens, it suffices to tell someone that the President is responsible and people start lining up to take action."" Another bystander, drawn to the conversation, said of the intervention: ""We are not against an intervention per se, which has protected some people, but rather the form of intervention. ""We would have liked to see the French come in here and help calm spirits and not wage a war. Now, people have died at their hands and these bitter memories will die hard."" Others explained their support of the mutineers, whose leaders, enlisted men and junior officers, continued talks today with Gen. Bernard Thorette, the French commander. ""The troops of the FACA were right,"" said Fernand Gretalita, a watchman on the main boulevard. ""The President says he is going to form a broad-based government, but he should have done that long ago. Instead, he surrounded himself with cronies who were stealing money from the country pell-mell. ""It is too bad that this all led to so much violence. Maybe the soldiers should have stayed in their barracks, but now the thieves in the Government must go."" The army mutiny, the second in two months, grew out of an insolvent Government's inability to pay soldiers who were owed several months salaries before their first uprising.. Most other Government employees are owed back pay as well. Two years after a 50 percent devaluation of the local French-backed franc, purchasing power and living standards for almost all but senior officials have plummeted. ""The soldiers, who go into the bush for a month at a time to defend our country from insurgents and poachers from Sudan and Chad and come back to town, are not paid,"" said Jose Yambi, who spoke near the demarcation line that separates French and rebel positions. ""What do you expect them to do? And what of us, the people, who don't get paid and have no guns to back our demands?"" From the start of this crisis, many residents have bitterly criticized the French, who have long wielded tremendous influence here. Gangs of angry youths, many wielding crude weapons, approached a visitor who walked the streets here today, but their threats evaporated once they were convinced he was not French. ""What we were living was a disguised colonialism,"" said Appolonaire Bina Doumba, 31, who studied in France. ""In every office where anything is decided here, you find a Frenchman. But these events represent an end of that era."" Told that other French-speaking heads of state had applauded the French intervention in support of President Patasse, Mr. Doumba, broke out in a cackling laugh. ""All of those heads of state support Patasse because they are all products of the same French-dominated system,"" he said as he showed visitors the French Cultural Center, which was burned down the other day. ""What do they know about the Central African Republic? Nothing. ""They do what they are told, just like our President, because they have all been bought by France."""8-Jul-96,LATIN AMERICA (92%); AFRICA (92%); GERMANY (91%); KENYA (90%); SWAZILAND (79%); PAKISTAN (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); NIGERIA (79%);,"Two years in Kenya as director of World Bank operations there convinced Peter Eigen of what he had begun to realize when he focused on Latin America: corruption was endemic, and, to put it mildly, seriously undermining development. Since the World Bank was pouring billions of dollars into development, it seemed only natural that it should do something about it. Mr. Eigen's colleagues in Africa had also seen enough. The response was ""enthusiastic,"" he recalled, when at a World Bank meeting in the African nation of Swaziland in 1990, he proposed that the bank work with governments and multinational companies to develop a code of conduct. But senior bank officials ordered Mr. Eigen to stop his anti-corruption efforts, saying they went beyond the bank's mandate, he said. He was not even to do it on his own time. With that, Mr. Eigen decided to take early retirement -- after 25 years at the bank -- and in 1993, he started a nongovernmental organization to combat corruption. Called Transparency International and headquartered in his native Berlin, the organization's goal, Mr. Eigen says, is to ""rid society of corruption."" Moral opprobrium toward bribery is nothing new. It goes back some 4,000 years, with prohibitions found on Babylonian tablets, John T. Noonan writes in ""Bribes,"" an 839-page moral, historical and legal tome on the subject (Macmillan, 1984). A Federal judge on the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, Mr. Noonan is a member of Transparency International's advisory council. Unlike Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, which have discovered that their effectiveness in combating abuses comes through issuing reports criticizing governments, Transparency International practices ""quiet diplomacy."" In an effort to win favor with governments and companies, whose policies and practices it hopes to change, the organization stresses that it does not investigate or even expose reports of bribery. The organization acquired international recognition in a way that did not please all members of the board. In the spring of 1995, the German magazine Der Spiegel reported that Transparency International had ranked countries by their corruption, based on surveys by risk analysts and businessmen. This was just the type of information that the cautious Transparency board did not want to be made public. But some of the staff, convinced that a bit of sunshine is the best disinfectant, were delighted with the Spiegel article, for there was no longer a reason for Transparency International not to publish the list. Intended to be an annual report, the latest Corruption Index, issued last month, places New Zealand and Denmark as the least corrupt countries, with Nigeria, Pakistan and Kenya dragging on the bottom. Last year, Transparency's budget was just over $500,000, about a third of it coming from businesses, Mr. Eigen said, among them General Electric, Bechtel, IBM, Pfizer, Nestle and Westinghouse. Taking business donations leaves the organization open to criticism that its independence is compromised, that its watchdog's teeth may not be so sharp, its officials acknowledged. But that is not Mr. Eigen's major concern. ""We worry more about taking government money,"" he said. The United States Agency for International Development supports the group, as do several European governments. A $10,000 donation from Ecuador, in 1993, fueled the organization's critics when it turned out that the money had come from a secret account, managed by Ecuador's Vice President at the time, Alberto Dahik, who preached against corruption at home and was chairman of Transparency International's advisory council. Under investigation in Ecuador, Mr. Dahik has resigned from Transparency and is now in exile in Costa Rica. After only three years, Transparency has chapters in 52 countries. One of the most important is the American chapter, based in Washington. It is heavily influenced by corporate boards and the United States Government, which desires to level the playing field for American businesses. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, enacted in 1977, prohibits the payment of bribes to foreign officials; it is the only law of its kind in the industrialized world. It is not always easy working with so many diverse chapters, Mr. Eigen said, diplomatically. ""It is a miracle that they have been brought under one umbrella, in particular a chapter as supportive and powerful as the American."" But the group's hardest tasks are with European governments and businesses. In Germany, it is against the law for a company to bribe a German civil servant, but it is not against the law for a German company to bribe a government official in a foreign country. This is the law in most European countries. What is more, in Germany, Greece, Luxembourg and Belgium, foreign-paid bribes are fully tax deductible. In other countries -- France, for instance, a bribe is a legal business expense, but only part of it can be deducted, a limitation that Mr. Eigen hardly finds laudable."16-Jul-96,GHANA (95%); WESTERN AFRICA (93%); AFRICA (92%); BURKINA FASO (79%); COTE D'IVOIRE (79%); NIGER (79%); MALI (79%); GUINEA (79%);,"Just beyond the yellow ""no trespassing"" sign, a burly fellow who calls himself Jangu-man stood ankle deep in chemical-laced black muck. He scooped some of it into a wooden gutter with a dented old army helmet and washed it, letting promising particles gather into a porous brown cloth. Quicksand-like pits have claimed the lives of at least five young men working in the moonscape around the Obuasi gold fields this year, and security forces have killed three and arrested 17 others. But Jangu-man, whose name means ""wild one,"" displayed the confidence of a giddy gambler with nothing left to lose, someone for whom the lure of gold was stronger than the fear of getting shot. Working on the run-off from soil that has already been processed with cyanide and arsenic at Ghana's leading industrial mine, Jangu-man is one of thousands of illegal gold miners across the country who often risk their health and their lives for a chance to strike it rich, or more often, just to keep themselves fed. The men gather around large-scale, licensed mining operations, living off what the big companies throw away or have not yet gotten to. There is plenty to go around, and Ghana, the former Gold Coast, is rapidly becoming a leading producer. Its Ashanti Goldfields Co. is now the world's 10th biggest producer, with its annual yield having grown in the past decade from 200 ounces to nearly 1 million. Ashanti, the only West African company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is leading West Africa into a gold boom that could help the region pull itself out of years of economic decline. Ashanti's expertise is being sought by such regional nations as Mali, Niger, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso and others that have watched Ghana's growth rate climb and its status soar in international circles that have often looked on West African governments with disdain because of their historic reputation for mismanagement and corruption. But fears are mounting over the growing tension between the illegal miners and mining companies in Ghana, as unemployed youths become more desperate to grab a piece of the wealth they see being extracted from around their villages. Economic reforms inspired by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have helped to boost foreign investment here, but they have also inspired resentment among local inhabitants who have reaped little from free-market innovations. ""There's no doubt that gold mining is precipitating a fairly steady increase in social tensions,"" a Western diplomat said. ""This is not a trickle-down type of prospecting,"" he added. ""It has enriched a small number of people at the top but certainly not that many at the bottom. ""You see some fancy cars around town, nice houses, but the lower 40 percent of the population is certainly no better off than they were a generation ago,"" he said. At least 1,000 illegal miners, known as galamsey, a local word that means ""sell it quick,"" armed themselves with blow guns, clubs, knives and machetes last month and attacked Ashanti security men who tried to run them off a particularly rich site. The miners also stole about 50,000 chickens from the company's poultry farm, ransacked the buildings and injured three policemen. ""The whites, they are making all the money; the government must institute a law to employ the local inhabitants here,"" said Blay Marshall Wellington, a secondary school teacher in Tarkwa, a town south of Obuasi. Local residents complain that foreign mining companies overlook them in favor of employees from Accra, the capital. Gold extraction and processing, however, has become increasingly mechanized and often requires the skills of an educated work force. Few local youths are qualified for jobs at Ashanti, having discarded their pencils for shovels when they were as young as 10 years old. The galamsey have been prospecting since Ashanti was established 100 years ago. Their gold fever drives them to extremes even though many of them earn little more than a few dollars a month after laboring six days a week, from sunrise to sunset, in the tropical heat. Five galamsey died of carbon monoxide poisoning in March while trying to pump water from an underground trench. In April, a group of illegal miners ransacked a meteorological station for thermometers containing mercury -- a toxic element they use with their bare hands to process the gold. Mercury can penetrate the skin to lodge in body tissue and bone and can seriously damage the nervous system. In January, the military was called in to drive more than 4,000 galamsey from a forest reserve after they had cut down 55 acres of trees in two months while prospecting. ""Even if there are a lot of jobs, I'd do this because I find this work very lucrative,"" said Anthony Yeboah, 35. ""Farming is too hard. With cocoa it is five to 10 years before you have a product."" The illegal miners sometimes find themselves ignored by their own communities even though they often bring more money into their villages than the big mines do. ""One of the problems is when you are not with one of these companies people will not even look at you,"" said John Kweku, 21, an illegal miner. The government of President Jerry Rawlings has responded to the tension between the galamsey and mining companies by boosting security at the mines and granting more concessions to individual miners. In effect, the government seems to be trying to strike a balance between its use of tax revenues and foreign exchange generated by large-scale gold mining to boost development and its efforts to appease the galamsey so they do not scare off foreign investors. Ghana's gross domestic product has increased by an annual average of 4 percent over the past four years. Mineral exports have accounted for about 40 percent of the country's gross foreign exchange earnings since 1992, compared to about 15 percent in the 1980s. ""This is one of the world's richest gold areas,"" the Western diplomat said. ""With the new extracting processes, West Africa will be one of three or four of the significant gold-bearing areas in the world."" Mining companies from South Africa, Australia, Canada and the United States that operate here often recruit their own security because many local police receive hush money from the galamsey. South African companies are particularly interested in keeping good relations with the illegal miners. ""They knew enough that they couldn't do it a la South Africa or there would have been major trouble,"" said one South African miner, referring to racial tension there prior to the end of white minority rule in 1993. ""You are running the risk of the sort of the political brand of 'Here come all those racist South Africans kicking all the locals off-site.' "" Mining companies in Ghana routinely pay high compensation to communities displaced by surface mining. But the funds often end up lining the pockets of local chiefs and district assemblymen, not in the hands of the most needy. ""It is only the galamsey that have saved the situation"" in many communities,"" said school principal E.K. Ayensu. ""And now the mining companies are asking them to move away from the concessions."""28-Jan-97,GHANA (94%); UNITED STATES (79%);,"Ambassador Ekwow Spio-Garbrah [""Up to Date in Ghana,"" letters, Jan. 15] represents a regime in Ghana that confuses constructive criticism with subversion, sees a conspiracy in almost every sentence written about Ghana and brands critics as ""enemies. During a campaign tour on Nov. 6, President Jerry Rawlings blamed opposition leaders for ""deliberately discouraging foreign investors to come into Ghana to invest."" Now the ambassador blames ""negative reporting."" True, Ghana has ""enjoyed an average annual economic growth rate of 4.5 percent for more than a decade."" Though this rate is better than that of Liberia or Somalia, it is nothing to crow about. Subtract a population growth rate of 3 percent, and that leaves a miserly 1.5 percent rate of growth of per capita income. Even tiny Benin has registered a respectable 8 percent average growth rate in the past two years. The growth the ambassador bragged about has been aid-induced, not generated by investment. To attract and spur investment, the Rawlings government repeatedly has been urged to repair crumbling infrastructure, establish the rule of law, curb rampant corruption, rein in escalating government expenditures, arrest the excessive printing of the currency and desist from attacking private industries. It has not done so. The World Bank, which has provided Ghana with more than $ 2 billion in loans since 1983, now says it was a mistake to sell Ghana as a ""success story."" A December 1995 study by its own Operations Evaluation Department warned: ""While Ghana has been hailed as a success story, prospects for satisfactory rates of growth and poverty reduction are uncertain. Agricultural growth is much slower than necessary and feasible, and may be slower than population growth. . . . Fiscal problems have resurfaced. Deficits are larger than is consistent with low inflation."" Joe Abbey, the former Ghana ambassador to the United States and now executive director of the Center for Policy Analysis, has warned of ""a full-blown economic crisis unless there is an urgent review of the level and quality of government spending."" He lamented that ""1995 presented one more year in a series of dashed hopes and frustrated expectations,"" adding that the current fears were based on the visible evidence of high rates of inflation, the fast depreciating nominal exchange rate, high interest rates, deceleration of economic growth and high unemployment. The ambassador would do well to look at his regime's own insane policies, rather than blame The Post's Stephen Buckley's ""negative reporting."" Alexandria"2-Feb-97,ALGERIA (99%); UNITED STATES (92%); FRANCE (79%); GERMANY (79%);,"JANUARY was the cruelest month in Algeria. Cruel in its violence, including a car-bombing that killed 42 people in central Algiers; cruel in the cynicism of the assassination of Abdelhak Benhamouda, an influential union leader who had wanted to forge a new political party. And cruel, above all, for the promise of yet more killing that was contained in a ranting speech by the President in which he blamed foreign plots for all of Algeria's woes and vowed to ""eradicate"" the terrorists. The Algerian civil war, which pits a ruthless military-backed government against often barbaric Islamic guerrillas, is five years old. It has become part of the background noise of world affairs, rumbling on like Kurdish clashes but rarely registering on the world's consciousness -- that is, its television screens. The conflict began when an election that was on the verge of bringing political Islam to power was canceled by the military in January 1992; it has rendered Algerian democracy -- and hopes that a stable political center could form -- stillborn. Hocine Ait Ahmed, an opposition leader, recently spoke of a ""Berlin wall"" around the war, evoking how the Algerian dreams of the 1980's have died amid general indifference. That wall has been composed of many elements: the secrecy of Algeria's rulers, known simply as ""le Pouvoir"" or ""the Power""; the intractability of a murky conflict; Western diplomatic inertia in a country where the choices appear particularly delicate, and the fact that Algeria's oil and natural gas have kept flowing to American and European companies. But as the recent violence suggests, the Algerian problem is festering to the point where it may prove harder to ignore. Its threat, just south of France, is clear: spreading Islamic militancy, a spillover of terrorism, a flood of refugees and the disruption of large oil and natural-gas supplies (into which American investment pours). A Hint of Opportunity But if this is a moment of crisis it may also be a moment when the West, whose options seem otherwise limited, could put some pressure on Algeria's leaders to restore a hope of democracy. Within the next few months, the country is due to hold its first parliamentary elections since the cancellation of the 1992 poll that nearly brought the Islamic Salvation Front to power. The party had brandished slogans like ""Islam is the solution"" to protest the corruption and economic mismanagement of Algeria's military-dominated regime. When the election was canceled, the party split into armed factions pursuing insurrection and a more moderate wing. How -- and indeed whether -- the new elections are held will test Algeria's direction and the West's readiness to encourage a democratic solution there. Breaking a long, and increasingly eerie, silence, French politicians of the left and right last week called for France to act. Lionel Jospin, the Socialist leader, said France could no longer provide ""blind support"" to President Liamine Zeroual's Government. And Valery Giscard d'Estaing, a former President, said the Islamic Salvation Front, now banned, should be allowed to participate in the election. The United States has maintained a determinedly low profile on Algeria since the war began. But tension between America and France over Algeria has been easing. French feelings that the Clinton Administration had been too conciliatory toward the Islamic Salvation Front have changed since the arrest late last year of Anwar Haddam, a prominent party member, in America. So a joint French-American initiative is technically possible, combining French economic leverage over Mr. Zeroual (France grants more than $1 billion annually to Algeria in subsidized loans) with the Clinton Administration's greater access to the Islamic Salvation Front. Opening the way for meaningful elections might entail a call on Mr. Zeroual to approach all parties, including the Islamic Salvation Front, in order to hammer out certain principles: the rejection of violence, respect for human rights, the elimination of torture, a commitment to the alternation of power through universal suffrage, a free press and respect for Algeria's Arab and Berber culture. the European Union's aid, debt relief, World Bank loans and the like, could all be used as carrots and sticks. But huge difficulties remain, all of them illustrated by the events of the last month. Mr. Zeroual's speech on Jan. 24 -- in which he raged against ""criminals, traitors and mercenaries manipulated by external circles"" -- was a textbook study in the closed mentality of Algeria's rulers. The very notion of open dialogue is generally foreign to them. In the speech, Mr. Zeroual ominously neglected to set a date for the new elections. The murder last week of Abdelhak Benhamouda was equally ominous. A prominent 55-year-old union leader and a determined opponent of Islamic fundamentalism, Mr. Benhamouda had been preparing to form a centrist political party. His last words to a friend, as reported in Algiers, were, ""Kamel, my friend, they have betrayed us."" One problem in Algeria is always to know who is killing whom. These words -- and the efficiency of his killing in central Algiers -- were widely seen as suggesting that the murder was the work of rival clans within ""le Pouvoir,"" rather than of Islamic guerrillas. Finally, the barbarity of the car-bombings, throat slittings and other killings that have swept Algiers and towns nearby since the Muslim holy month of Ramadan started on Jan. 10 have illustrated, once again, the unconscionable methods of the violent factions that have splintered from the Islamic Salvation Front. It is unclear to what extent the Front itself -- its leaders dead, arrested or abroad -- is still a coherent political force. Still, the frustrated, largely silenced democratic yearnings of a broad Algerian center exist and could be buttressed by Western diplomacy. Those yearnings, and economic frustration, propelled people into the streets of Algiers in the late 1980's to push for democracy, at the same time as people in Central Europe protested against their own dictators and Marxist economic mismanagement. The Algerian democratic movement went nowhere. The country remains torn by latent ethnic tensions (a Berber minority represents perhaps a third of the population), suffers from decades of official corruption and is unsure what to make of its long French colonial history. It still seeks its true identity. The democratic opening that began in 1988 was largely about finding one. Still today, it appears, as Mr. Jospin said, that ""democracy, in the end, is the only road to peace."""19-Apr-97,UNITED STATES (93%); SOUTH-EASTERN ASIA (79%); AFRICA (79%);,"THERE IS no one, as it seems, including the leadership of the World Bank, who does not think that organization urgently needs reform. Some point to the very mixed record of foreign aid. A recent study from the World Bank itself, in fact, notes that aid to governments that are following sound economic policies can be helpful, but that aid to regimes going in the wrong direction is wasted -- and too often the bank and other donors have poured money into the wrong regimes, for years and years. Moreover, thanks to the globalization of the economy, private investment flows to developing countries are five times larger than World Bank and all other official development assistance. From the fact of this energized private market, there are some asking: Who even needs official help? The answer to this last question is: lots of countries. The private flows go overwhelmingly to a dozen or so countries, mostly the fast-developing nations of Southeast Asia. Dozens more, in Africa and elsewhere, get almost none and still depend on official aid. Unfortunately, as the World Bank points out in an admirably candid self-portrait, it hasn't lived up to their needs. Not keeping up with the changing world economy ""has resulted, over time, in a severe deterioration -- indeed a crisis -- in our effectiveness,"" the bank admits. Fully one-third of its projects end unsatisfactorily. Now, in what may prove the bank's last chance, it has launched a program of radical ""renewal."" Given how many reorganizations the bank has been subjected to over the years, it is not surprising that there is skepticism among many. But bank president James D. Wolfensohn has pointed this reform in the right direction. He is seeking to move people and resources from Washington out to the front lines. He wants more emphasis on health, education and rural development -- the social services essential to economic growth. He has recognized the need to fight corruption and build legal and financial institutions -- to help nations develop the conditions, in other words, that will attract those ever-growing private investment flows. Whether this latest reform succeeds will depend in large part on whether the bank proves able to help nations that are pursuing reform -- and walk away from corrupt regimes that aren't. That success is far from sure. But the United States, the bank's largest contributor, is right to support the effort. A thriving World Bank can promote U.S. interests throughout the world, relieving pressure on the U.S. bilateral aid budget and maximizing the impact of U.S. help."25-Apr-97,AFRICA (94%); UGANDA (94%); UNITED STATES (92%);,"DURING HER recent trip to Africa, Hillary Clinton visited nations that belie the basket-case stereotypes often attached to the entire continent. In Uganda, for example, she praised that nation's democratization, its economic reforms, the ""stunning growth rate"" of its economy and its commitment to primary education for all. Whether Uganda can make good on that revolutionary promise of universal primary schooling is to a large extent being decided in Washington this week and next. Top officials from the Clinton administration and counterparts from other wealthy nations, meeting at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, are debating how to implement a debt relief initiative for developing countries. The terms of debate are dry, but what's at stake is the possibility of reform and renewal. Many developing countries are so burdened by debt that a huge portion of their national income, including the aid they receive, is immediately recycled to banks and governments to the north. Uganda spends about seven times as much on debt repayment as on primary education, while about one-third of its children can't go to school at all -- although education is a crucial prerequisite for development. Blame this heavy burden first and foremost on the poor countries themselves, and on the corrupt regimes that squandered aid year after year. Nations where such regimes still hold sway should be cut off. But last fall, with strong U.S. leadership, the world's leading lenders agreed that nations with a strong commitment to, and record of, reform should get some debt relief, or else even the best policies wouldn't save them. Now lenders will decide which countries will benefit, when and by how much. Some officials want to move slowly, either because they never liked debt relief in the first place or to use the promise of forgiveness as leverage to promote further reform. But reformers throughout the developing world need evidence that this debt initiative is for real -- that swallowing the medicine of economic reform really will bring rewards. For that credibility to be achieved, Uganda, with its long and impressive track record, should be given as much help as possible, and other deserving nations should follow swiftly behind."17-May-97,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (97%); AFRICA (94%); UNITED STATES (93%); ANGOLA (92%); BELGIUM (90%); FRANCE (79%); CENTRAL AFRICA (79%); SWITZERLAND (79%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (79%);","In more than three decades at the center of his country's political stage, Mobutu Seso Seke was nothing if not an extraordinary survivor. But his tenacity and resourcefulness finally failed him today as he stealthily left his capital, a defeated man. Mr. Mobutu has been called one of the world's wealthiest heads of state, a brutal dictator, an inveterate meddler in the affairs of neighbors and a colossal ego. His style, at once bold and vainglorious, was for an entire generation the very model of an African autocrat. Resplendent in his signature leopard-skin cap and carved wooden scepter topped with an eagle, Mr. Mobutu -- through his canny courtship of Western support, destabilization of his neighbors, systematic corruption and grandiose economic schemes -- left Zaire teetering on the brink of economic collapse. His cult of personality rose to such heights that for weeks at a time, Zaire's official press was forbidden to mention the name of any other Zairian than the President himself. Mr. Mobutu almost singlehandedly invented Zaire, even giving the country its name in replacement of the colonial name, Congo. But his personal appetite for luxury and wealth spawned a system of official corruption so rapacious that he leaves behind a country in ruin, where revenue from lucrative mines has been squandered or squirreled away in foreign bank accounts. Life in a vast country deprived of roads, health care, electricity, telephones and often education has reverted to a brutishness unknown since the 1940's. Still, even many of Mr. Mobutu's harshest critics acknowledge one achievement, and it is a major one in an Africa of artificially drawn states riven by ethnic animosities. Inheriting a land of more than 450 ethnic groups that had French as an official language but no commonly spoken tongue, Mr. Mobutu managed to forge a sense of nationhood in Africa's third-largest country as strong as exists anywhere on this continent. This was accomplished, in part, by successfully promoting the use of three major African languages -- Lingala, Swahili and Tshiluba -- to draw citizens together across ethnic lines. At the same time, Zaire experienced a period of extraordinary cultural creativity, in song, in dress and in art. This came about partly as a result of deliberate efforts to favor local influences over foreign ones, and partly because of the need of Zairians to survive by their own means in the absence of a functioning Government. Throughout a career that began at independence from Belgium, during the height of the cold war, Mr. Mobutu seemed to thrive on crises, buying off enemies when he did not kill them outright, and currying favor with Washington by allowing his country to be used as a base in wars against Soviet influence in central Africa. But the rebel leader Laurent Kabila's seven-month fight revealed Mr. Mobutu's army to be toothless and his Government an empty shell. In the end, the undoing of a man known as a master calculator resulted from a long series of costly misjudgments of a sick and aging politician well past his prime.  Rising Star A Helping Hand From the C.I.A. Mr. Mobutu's ascent began in September 1960, at the dawn of Zaire's independence, when he seized power during quarrels between the pro-Western President Joseph Kasavubu and the nationalist Patrice Lumumba, the country's first Prime Minister. Mr. Mobutu, a journalist and army sergeant, had been picked by Mr. Lumumba as chief of staff and prodded toward the center of the political stage by the Central Intelligence Agency, which had chosen him as its best tool for keeping the nation out of the socialist orbit. Although he has always denied it, many scholars believe that Mr. Mobutu helped organize the 1961 execution of Mr. Lumumba at C.I.A.'s urging. During the early independence years, the C.I.A. called most of the shots in Zaire. Nonetheless, Mr. Mobutu often frustrated his C.I.A. handlers. In the words of Smith Hempstone, the former American diplomat and journalist, Mr. Mobutu was in the 1960's ""one of the weakest strongmen in history, a black Hamlet, plagued by indecision, unwilling to assume power himself."" But when Mr. Mobutu finally seized power outright on Nov. 24, 1965, after American help enabled him to extinguish a series of regional uprisings by followers of Mr. Lumumba, he wasted little time putting his stamp on Zaire. By Zairian standards, Mr. Mobutu's early years in office were a period of relative calm, even if sporadic troubles continued here and there, notably in the Fizi-Baraka mountain range of South Kivu Province, where a sputtering rebellion led by one Laurent Desire Kabila refused to die. Beginning with his first speech after seizing power, Mr. Mobutu set a dictatorial tone, telling a large crowd gathered in a Kinshasa stadium that it had taken five years for the politicians to lead the country to ruin. ""This is why on Nov. 24, 1965, the stupid struggle for influence in which political parties were engaged was ended,"" he said. ""For five years, there will be no more political party activity in the country."" Almost immediately, Mr. Mobutu established a brand of unchallenged one-man rule that lasted until 1990. Mr. Mobutu ordered the creation of a sole, powerful political party, the Popular Revolutionary Movement, making membership obligatory for all Zairians. In the early years, at least, he set out to attract the best and brightest of Zaire's small university community, eagerly soliciting their advice. With time, however, the effects of flattery and a growing taste for power took over, and the President's style of rule became both insular and absolute. Challengers, both imagined and real, often paid with their lives, like the four former Cabinet ministers whom Mr. Mobutu had publicly hanged before 50,000 spectators six months after he took office. As an unmistakable Mobutu style began to emerge in the late 1960's and early 1970's, it became clear that the Zairian leader's ambition was to fashion a great African state. Mr. Mobutu began to study other dictatorships, drawing freely from them. ""This man has spoken; he has written, set forth orientation and decrees,"" Mpinga Kasenda, a former Prime Minister, said in a characteristic speech of the period praising Mr. Mobutu. ""The sum total of his actions constitutes Mobutism, just as the sum total of Mao's actions constitutes Maoism.""  All-Powerful Leader From Mobutu To Mobutism Mobutism quickly became the new national ideology, and since a constitution written expressly to please him provided the President unlimited powers, Mr. Mobutu's words took on the force of law. By 1970, with mineral revenues growing fast, Mr. Mobutu felt secure enough in his rule to make known his grandiose vision for Zaire. At an extraordinary party congress that year, he announced a bid for national greatness called Goal 80. The plan consisted of a 10-year program to double copper production, industrialize the country with steel mills and deep-water ports, and undertake a program of huge investments in Kinshasa, Kisangani and around the southern mining capital, Lubumbashi. The largest project of all was the Inga dam, near Kinshasa, at the time one of the world's largest hydroelectric dams, followed by the 1,110-mile-long Inga-Shaba power grid, spanning dense forest and empty savanna on its route to the copper-producing, independence-minded Shaba Province, which Mr. Mobutu's project aimed to make dependent upon electricity supplied from afar. When the World Bank refused to finance the project, believing it to be far too costly, the United States Export-Import Bank stepped in, in a gesture of political support for a man considered to be a vital cold-war ally. But within a few years, the heavy debt incurred for the $1 billion project, which has been operating since 1977, became a crippling economic burden. In 1971, Mr. Mobutu unveiled a new twist on the official ideology with a program known as ""authenticity."" Zairians were obliged to change their Western names to African ones, drop titles like Mr. and Mrs. in favor of ""citizen"" and abandon European dress for tunics for men and wraps of printed cloth for women. Mr. Mobutu sought to set the tone by replacing his given name, Joseph Desire Mobutu, with Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu waza Banga, which has often been translated as ""the all-conquering warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, will go from conquest to conquest leaving fire in his wake."" Authenticity was followed, in 1973, by ""Zairianization,"" a program that expropriated farms, factories and businesses belonging to foreigners, from Belgians who had remained since the colonial period to the Greek, Jewish and Pakistani traders who had dominated much of the country's small-scale commerce. As might have been expected, the nationalizations and handing out of businesses to politically selected Zairians were initially popular. It was not long, however, before things began to go badly wrong. With almost no prior experience in the businesses they inherited, many Zairians quickly sought to lure foreigners back to run them in their place. Others simply sold off their goods and failed to re-stock. Soon Zaire's economy was near collapse. One group of people, however, benefited far more than others, and in lasting ways, from the Africanization program: Mr. Mobutu and a small circle of relatives and friends. Takeovers under Zairianization were, in fact, but one of Mr. Mobutu's many sources of wealth. The scholars Crawford Young and Thomas Turner quoted 1978 Bank of Zaire estimates that 50 Zairian companies had illegally secreted some $300 million abroad. Eight of the largest of these companies were owned by Mr. Mobutu or his immediate family. The collapse of the economy under Zairianization did not force Mr. Mobutu to backtrack; instead, he rushed ahead into ever more radical measures that over time helped undo him. Returning home from a state visit to China and North Korea in 1974, Mr. Mobutu announced a 10-point program to eliminate what he called the country's 10 scourges. A food shortage, he said, would be ended by organizing agricultural brigades. Unemployment was to be ended by decree. Every community was ordered to begin building nursery schools, and employers were told to provide free uniforms and supplies for their workers' children. Marked by his experience of the Communist east, Mr. Mobutu grew ever more grandiose, and his cult of personality ever more intense. President Mobutu began to affect titles like the Helmsman and the Guide, and the news on state television opened with images of Mr. Mobutu descending from the heavens. While the economy continued to decline, it was not until the collapse of copper prices in the mid-1970's that Mr. Mobutu reluctantly began to change economic course. But by then, no one would lend to Zaire any longer, foreign aid programs were bring cut back sharply, inflation was galloping and the grand state that he had set out to build entered a long period of decay. According to histories of this period, Mr. Mobutu, seeing no way out of his country's economic and political crisis, briefly considered abandoning power when he took his family to Switzerland in March 1976. But he returned home to confront a series of major new crises, the most serious of which were invasions of Shaba Province in March 1977 and May 1978 by remnants of the Katangese rebel force that had sought independence for that region shortly after independence. The two Shaba invasions, both from Angolan territory, quickly revealed the battlefield ineptitude of the Zairian Army, and in both instances, foreign troops and American transport planes had to be summoned to put down the rebellions.  Regional Meddler A Finger in Affairs Of His Neighbors The tremendous mineral wealth of Shaba, with 80 percent of the world's cobalt reserves and 20 percent of its copper supplies, helped Mr. Mobutu secure international military and financial support. The West, and Washington in particular, also had been using Zaire as a weapons supply and staging area for support of the anti-Communist Unita rebel movement fighting the Marxist Government in Angola. Mr. Mobutu, acting with strong C.I.A. encouragement, had been assisting rebel movements fighting Angola's Marxist Government. The first involvement was a disastrous C.I.A.-backed effort to seize Angola's oil-producing Cabinda enclave, which began in 1975, the day before Angola achieved independence from Portugal. Mr. Mobutu's meddling in Angola, at the behest of Washington, set a pattern for the rest of his rule. He constantly kept a finger in the crises of neighboring countries, from Chad and Congo to Uganda and the Sudan. With its borders with nine other countries, Mr. Mobutu marketed his country to Washington and Paris -- obtaining economic aid and political support in exchange -- as a platform for interventions and covert operations throughout central and southern Africa. With the end of the cold war, Mr. Mobutu's relevance to Washington and most of the West declined sharply. In 1990, as a wave of democratic change swept much of Africa, Mr. Mobutu was forced to allow multiparty politics. A tumultuous national conference that drew from many parts of Zairian society convened and obliged Mr. Mobutu to accept his most determined political rival, Etienne Tshisekedi, as Prime Minister. When Mr. Tshisekedi sought to assert his control over state finances, however, Mr. Mobutu removed him from office, setting off a crisis that led to the first of two outbreaks of killings and looting in the capital by Government soldiers. Popular support for Mr. Tshisekedi was so overwhelming that Mr. Mobutu retreated from the capital, living for a time on his luxurious houseboat on the Congo River, and eventually in his palatial home in the northern town of Gbadolite. After the swift end of a second stint in office by Mr. Tshisekedi, officials in Washington, Paris and Brussels in 1994 engineered the appointment as Prime Minister of Kengo wa Dondo, a long associate of the President and former Finance Minister.  Mr. Kengo was supposed to govern for a year, and his mandate was to organize national elections, rein in galloping inflation and restore the authority of a decaying state. Despite unstinting Western support, Mr. Kengo's administration was widely seen as a disaster. Civil servants were unpaid for months at a time, no progress was made toward elections and corruption continued as blatantly as ever. Mr. Mobutu experienced a brief and unexpected return to international relevance with the 1994 civil war and mass killing in neighboring Rwanda. More than a million Rwandan Hutu, many of them participants in the killing of members of the Tutsi minority, fled into Zaire after a Tutsi-led insurgency seized power. Foreign governments and international aid organizations were obliged to deal with Mr. Mobutu, ending a period of diplomatic isolation. Relations with France, which had been a major backer of the defeated Hutu Government in Rwanda, nearly returned to their historic warmth. The end for Mr. Mobutu came with surprising speed, after Rwanda's Tutsi-led Government supported an uprising by Zairian Tutsi who had come under attack in eastern Zaire. In three weeks in October 1996, what had been a Tutsi uprising turned into a full-blown political rebellion against Mr. Mobutu led by Mr. Kabila. Once Mr. Kabila's newborn Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo seized the major cities of Zaire's far east, African patrons with scores to settle against Mr. Mobutu lined up to help the rebels with money, men and arms. The anti-Mobutu coalition came to include Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and, with major support provided toward the end of the war, Angola, where Mr. Mobutu had interfered the most in three decades of rule. When Bill Richardson, the United States delegate to the United Nations and President Clinton's special envoy, visited Zaire early this month to engineer Mr. Mobutu's resignation, the aging, cancer-ridden President asked him why, after years of loyal service and friendship with the West, he had been abandoned. ""I said the mess you are in is not our mess,"" Mr. Richardson said. ""You just didn't govern your own country."" Chronology: ""An African Dictator's Rise and Fall"" OCT. 14, 1930 Joseph Desire Mobutu is born in Lisala, a town in the northern Belgian Congo. Adopted in infancy by a cook for local Belgian missionaries, he goes to missionary schools. 1950 Joins the Belgian-controlled colonial army, where he works as a journalist. He rises to sergeant major, the highest rank open to Africans. 1956 Leaves army and works as a newspaper columnist in Leopoldville, the capital. 1959 Takes part in conference determining independence of the Congo from Belgium. Returns to Leopoldville as riots for independence take place. 1960 Congo is declared independent from Belgium on June 30. Joseph Kasavubu becomes President and Patrice Lumumba the Prime Minister. Mobutu is named Secretary of State for National Defense. Within days of independence, the Government's control is compro 2/3mised by mutinies and local disturbances. Mobutu returns to the army, given the rank of colonel. On Sept. 14, Mobutu leads a coup removing both Kasavubu and Lumumba. 1961 Lumumba is killed under mysterious circumstances in January. Mobutu returns power to President Kasavubu in February. 1965 Mobutu ousts civilian Government in a bloodless coup and declares himself President. The next year he has four former Government ministers hanged for treason. 1970 Presidential elections are held; Mobutu is the only candidate. 1972 The year after Mobutu changes the name of his country to Zaire, he changes his own name to Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu waza Banga and urges all Zairians to assume African names. 1973 The Government seizes 2,000 economic enter 2/3prises owned by foreigners, with Mobutu profiting the most. 1978 French paratroopers help Mobutu defeat exiled Zairians invading from neighboring Angola. 1990 Mobutu orders a massacre of students at the University of Lubumbashi to quell growing unrest. Belgium, the United States and France cut off assistance and demand democratic reforms. Mobutu ultimately agrees to national conference on reforms but openly bribes supporters and sends the army after opponents. 1991 Appoints Etienne Tshisekedi, an opponent, Prime Minister after rioting in the capital but dismisses him 12 days later. 1994 Mobutu dissolves legislature. 1995 Opposition increases; Mobutu spends most of time at palace in Gbadolite in northern Zaire. Mobutu's troops battle opposition supporters, killing nine civilians and one army officer. 1996 Mobutu leaves for cancer treatment in Switzerland in July. In eastern Zaire, ethnic Tutsi led by Laurent Kabila rebel in September after local officials try to expel them. Mobutu returns to Zaire in December. 1997 Kabila's rebels sweep westward across Zaire. Mobutu-Kabila peace talks in May fail, and on May16, Mobutu gives up power.

This was provided by foreign aid agencies and in bribes by multinational corporations in return for exclusive deals. Meanwhile, despite untold volumes of diamonds and other natural resources in their midst, millions of people in Zaire languished in absolute poverty. Such human rights abuses are rampant in Africa, elsewhere in the Third World and in much of the former Soviet Union. Now there is an opportunity to secure change. This week U.S. Secretary of Commerce William Daley leads the U.S. effort at the ministerial conference in Paris of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to secure agreement that the leading industrial countries should enact legislation to bar multinational corporations from paying foreign bribes. At the moment it appears that the other key Group of 7 countries (the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan) will publicly declare that they will go along with the U.S. initiative, but some skepticism may be justified. Agreements have been reached that the major industrial countries will all finalize a treaty by the end of this year to criminalize international bribery by multinational corporations and that the treaty will be ratified in 1998. But ensuring the timetable is kept and then ensuring there is enforcement may not be easy. For example, for quite some time the Germans and French have been dragging their feet when it comes to even supporting a very broad-based set of understandings. The anti-corruption issue is on the agendas because U.S. business has lobbied successfully to win administration actions that it claims can help create a ""level playing field."" The United States is alone in having a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which makes it a criminal offense for U.S. corporations to pay bribes abroad to win contracts. Companies have been caught, charged and, as Lockheed discovered a couple of years ago, fined up to $ 25 million for violating the FCPA. By contrast, Germany, for example, permits German firms to deduct their foreign bribes from their taxes. No wonder Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin stressed in a speech to World Bank ministers in late April that ""I urge all countries that continue to extend tax deductibility to bribes to act expeditiously to eliminate that practice."" Important as U.S. business interests are, there is more at stake in the anti-corruption initiative. Persistent corruption by major multinational companies across the developing world, and in Eastern Europe, has four particularly damaging effects: It distorts ""fair"" trade and makes a mockery of the concept of international competitiveness. It sustains corrupt autocrats in power (for example, look at much of the former Soviet Union, not to mention many African countries) and diminishes prospects for building democracy. It leads to a massive misallocation and waste of scarce public-sector budget resources, especially in poor countries, and so has dire human rights consequences -- in many countries palaces and sports stadiums are built while the rural and urban poor do not even have minimal health care and school facilities. It renders foreign aid programs ineffective. European and Japanese multinational corporations routinely pay bribes around the globe. After effective public criticism of its environmental and human rights policies, the Royal Dutch Shell group recently announced a new set of corporate values. But Shell avoided the bribery issue, perhaps because a lot of its business is in Nigeria, which is widely seen by business as the world's most corrupt country. Other leading European multinationals are just as shy as Shell. And no wonder, given the lack of evidence of sincere interest by European leaders in tackling the issue. The United States has done all the work, constantly pushing in the OECD and other forums and stressing that transparency in international contracting is vital. Strong anti-corruption statements by top ministers from other leading industrial nations have been noticeably absent. The new understandings on a treaty are a victory for the U.S. administration and worth applauding. But there is merit in striving now to cement the gains and keep the feet of OECD governments to the fire on this hot issue. Accordingly, the subject of international bribery should be on the agenda of the Group of 7 summit in Denver next month. President Clinton should put it on the agenda and secure some advance support for it. Calls by the president to the heads of the British and Canadian governments could just possibly win their support for a bold Denver declaration. British Prime Minister Tony Blair has, after all, started talking about giving U.K. foreign policy a humanitarian element. The U.S. needs allies in its campaign to curb corruption. Without them the leading Europeans and the Japanese are likely to continue their pro-bribery policies. The writer is vice chairman of Transparency International, a Berlin-based organization seeking to curb corruption in international business transactions."4-Jun-97,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (95%); SWITZERLAND (94%); CENTRAL EUROPE (59%);","Swiss banks have uncovered little more than $ 3 million in assets belonging to Zaire's deposed dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, following a government-ordered search of accounts, the nation's chief banking supervisor reported today. The holdings, assessed in a review of more than 400 banks, amount to only a fraction of the multi-billion-dollar fortune that Kinshasa's new rulers say remains hidden in Swiss accounts. The result prompted fresh demands for a more intensive investigation to determine whether front companies, false identities or secret numbered accounts have been used to hide much of Mobutu's wealth. Switzerland's federal banking commission announced that six banks have identified holdings worth 4.8 million Swiss francs (about $ 3.4 million) that are clearly connected to Mobutu, his family, or people and companies associated with them. The assets include foreign shares, bonds, securities and a safe deposit box whose contents have not been revealed. But the new government in Kinshasa, headed by President Laurent Kabila, insists it has evidence that a substantial portion of the funds and resources that Mobutu siphoned out of the country during nearly 32 years in power may still be locked in Swiss vaults. Celestin Lwangi, justice minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly Zaire, said last week that her government believes Mobutu has stashed 11 billion Swiss francs (about $ 7.7 billion) within a secret financial empire that he and his family established over the years in Switzerland. Other estimates, based on World Bank figures and Mobutu's former advisers, place his family fortune at closer to $ 4 billion. Daniel Zuberbuehler, deputy director of the Swiss banking commission, said he is satisfied with the findings and does not believe a further search is warranted. He dismissed the latest estimates from Kinshasa as ""wild stories."" ""There are no billions,"" Zuberbuehler said. ""Of course, they can say anything, but these would be dreams. It would be nice if Mobutu had billions here, but he has probably spent the money."" After Mobutu fled his homeland last month and Kabila took power in Kinshasa, Switzerland impounded all the dictator's assets within its territory, including a 30-room villa near Lausanne with an estimated market value of more than $ 5 million. Bern also ordered a sweep of the nation's banks to trace any accounts linked to him or his relatives. Zuberbuehler said the bulk of the assets uncovered in the search is held at one Swiss bank in two large accounts. He declined to release the names of the banks involved and indicated they may face legal action. Since 1990, Switzerland has sought to impose tougher restrictions on banks to prevent money laundering by drug dealers and corrupt potentates. The new laws are part of an effort to clean up Switzerland's image as a haven for tainted money. But the nation's banks have been reluctant to dilute the traditions of discretion and secrecy that have brought them their best clients. The credibility of Swiss banks has also suffered because of controversies about the fate of looted Nazi gold and the dormant accounts of Holocaust victims. After insisting that they had made public all pertinent information, the banks have been embarrassed repeatedly by subsequent revelations. Jean Ziegler, a Socialist member of parliament and prominent critic of Switzerland's banking industry, charged today that Swiss banks are hiding the true extent of Mobutu's holdings in the same way they tried to deny they were hoarding Nazi gold or the assets of Holocaust victims. ""The banks are lying once again to save their client Mobutu,"" Ziegler said. ""It shows they have not learned anything from the scandal involving the Holocaust accounts."""17-Jun-97,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (93%); CENTRAL AFRICA (79%);","Every day, Western businessmen in suits and ties risk riding in creaking elevators at the Ministry of Mines, an imposing 20-story building on the main street of this capital. They wait on chairs with foam protruding from the cushions for audiences with officials of the new Government in order to buy the right to go into malaria-infested jungles. A Western mining executive, standing before a geological map hanging on the wall outside the minister's office, explained why. ""This is all money,"" he said, his hand sweeping an arc over the eastern rim of this vast country, passing over symbols for cobalt, zinc, magnesium, iron, copper, diamonds and gold. The businessman would not give his name, nor that of his company. If he could have, he would probably have denied his presence in the country. His partner in front of the map would not utter a single word while a reporter was present. The stealth and secrecy reflect a fiercely competitive atmosphere here as mining companies vie for concessions in ""potentially the wealthiest country in the world,"" as the man in front of the map called it. No mineral trader wants to let a competitor know where his lode is. An Australian mining executive said there might be 250 tons of gold, worth $3 billion, to be mined in Congo, the Central African giant formerly called Zaire. At the moment, the gold riches are virtually untouched, he said. Congo is believed to have 80 percent of the world's cobalt reserves. Its copper mines are said to be capable of yielding 500,000 tons a year; they now yield no more than 50,000. The wealth has always been here, of course. But the avarice of the country's longtime former ruler, Mobutu Sese Seko -- bribes were required to get in, and then a share of the action went to a Mobutu crony once business became profitable -- scared away foreign investors for decades. Now, after the collapse of Mr. Mobutu's rule, it is seen as a new day here for business. Laurent Kabila, who was sworn in as president last month after an eight-month push ending the country's civil war, has a guerrilla past and uncertain plans for the future. But his ministers talk like capitalists and have vowed to end corruption. ""Everything I've seen shows they want to govern honestly, that they want foreign investment,"" said W. S. Turner, general manager of Anvil Mining, an Australian company that has signed a copper-mining contract with the new Government. ""As long as that philosophy is there, we're happy to be part of it."" The new Government has slashed the fee for a diamond trading license to $50,000 from $150,000. ""We are trying not to be too greedy; we want to be humble,"" Finance Minister Mwana Mawampanga said. Besides, the state was not really losing anything in cutting the fee; the money, he said, used to go largely into the pockets of Mr. Mobutu and his friends, not into the treasury. There is also a desire for more companies to trade in diamonds. ""We need competition, so our people get the best prices for their products,"" said Mr. Mawampanga, who has advanced economics degrees from Penn State and the University of Kentucky. One monopoly the Government says it intends to break is that of De Beers Consolidated Mines, the South African diamond group under the Anglo American Corporation that was the only company to buy the production of the Congolese state diamond company during the Mobutu era. The Government has not yet decided what it will do with the diamond-mining company, the Societe Miniere de Bakwang, known as MIBA, or with the state mining company known as Gecamines. But officials said in recent interviews that the Government was exploring the possibility of selling large interests in both to one or more international companies. ""We want a market economy,"" Mr. Mawampanga said. ""But we want to ask those companies who come to invest in our country to be good corporate citizens."" The potential for outside investment extends beyond the nation's mineral wealth, with staggering possibilities for public works contracts. In a country of perhaps 50 million people in an area comparable to the United States east of the Mississippi, there is less than 1,500 miles of paved road. Much of the country is not served by telephone. But for now, the focus of the action is in the ground. From Poland to South Africa, from Canada and the United States to Australia and Japan, the mining companies are coming, small, medium and large. The Ministry of Mines says possible investors include another Australian company, Rhodes Mining, as well as several Canadian ones like the Barrick Gold Corporation and the Caledonia Mining Corporation. A Government mining official, Jean-Claude Muyambo, said that many of the companies were trying to take advantage of the lack of experience at the Ministry of Mines. Mr. Muyambo, who is 32, was a human rights lawyer until the new Minister of Mines, Mututulo Kambale, a former professor of English at a teachers' college, asked him to help out. ""They think they are smarter than we are,"" said Mr. Muyambo, whose dark suit, white shirt and tie would have blended in at a New York City law firm but who looked alien in his squalid office -- the carpets beyond threadbare, the walls stained and wires protruding from holes in the ceiling where there should be light fixtures. He said the companies proposed contracts that gave them the right to explore, mine and trade, while paying an amount based only on the right to explore. ""When we tell them something is wrong with the contract, they think we want bribes,"" Mr. Muyambo said. With the stakes so high and Government officials so poor, how is it going to be possible to stop the corruption? ""It's a very good question,"" Bernard Maneno, a senior official in the Ministry of Mines, said with a heavy sigh. But the Government will have to do so if it is serious about attracting foreign investment, Mr. Turner of Anvil Mining said. ""On the technical side, the risks are very low,"" he said, adding that the mineral deposits were high grade, easy to find, easy to mine and easy to process. ""The big issue, he continued, ""is the political risk. The Government doesn't have to do very much to create the right political climate."" A start for Mr. Kabila, Mr. Turner said, would be to create a multiparty democracy. That, he said, would help bring in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, whose financing may be required for large-scale mining projects. And a democracy could give rise to the rules and stable institutions that would spur business confidence in investing in Congo. But the new President has for the present banned political party activity and declared elections to be two years away. So for now, potential investors simply remain hopeful his Government will succeed, and that hope has encouraged all manner of participants in a new gold rush. The other day, Al Andersen, a missionary with the Baptist International Church of Congo, was in the Ministry of Mines in search of a concession. The church's land, it seems, holds a gold deposit. Where? Mr. Andersen, as if taking a cue from the big mining companies' approach, put his hands over the map to cover up the area, in a gesture of mock secrecy. ""I don't want everyone to know where our mines are,"" he said. ""Nobody else is here yet. All the big guys are over there,"" he said, pointing to the east."21-Jul-97,LIBERIA (94%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%); AFRICA (92%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (79%); EUROPE (79%); UNITED STATES (79%);,"Charles Taylor, the warlord who started and dominated Liberia's brutal seven-year civil war, appeared today to have won by election the power he was unable to seize in battle. Early returns from Saturday's presidential vote gave Taylor a huge lead in what Liberians say was their country's freest balloting ever. With about 12 percent of votes counted, Taylor had 62 percent. His top rival, former World Bank and U.N. official Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, had 18 percent. It also appeared that Taylor's party would get a majority in a new legislature, which is being elected by a proportional representation of the nationwide vote. Final results are expected Wednesday. The credible election fulfills a goal of the United States and European and West African nations, which are trying to help rebuild the collapsed Liberian state. But Taylor's victory frustrates the longtime desire by many of those countries to keep him out of power because they see him as a corrupt and pompous authoritarian. Though incomplete, the results announced tonight appeared unlikely to be reversed. They came from disparate areas, including parts of Liberia where Taylor's opponents were thought to have important bases of strength and included no ballots from his own regional stronghold. The election represents an important step forward for a country riven by factional ethnic strife. But Taylor's apparent victory will raise immediate new concerns. If Taylor has proven himself Liberia's most popular political figure, in some circles he remains its most hated. During a war that killed an estimated 150,000 or more people and included brutality on all sides, human rights groups frequently reported atrocities by Taylor's forces, which included gun-toting children. In addition, Taylor has bitter enemies among Liberia's Krahn and Mandingo ethnic groups, and the commander of West African peacekeeping forces deployed here announced today that a government official, a Krahn, had confessed to participating this summer in a plot to kill Taylor. He said the man had repented and had been released after Taylor forgave him. International election observers withheld final assessments of the vote pending the completion of the count, but said it appeared so far to have been conducted fairly. Johnson-Sirleaf accused peacekeeping soldiers of casting votes for people too confused to vote themselves and of beating members of her party who objected, the Associated Press reported. Observers from the United Nations, the European Union and other groups had high marks for the way yesterday's balloting was conducted. Still, the control that Taylor's faction exercised in much of the country gave him huge advantages during the campaign. For years, his forces have run a quasi-government in much of the country, financing it by selling off the riches of Liberia's mines and forests. But a Taylor victory will have been won with more than his war booty. Taylor's persona as a powerful leader appealed to many who believe the country needs a firm hand following seven years of fratricide. A political analyst suggested last month that while a government run by Johnson-Sirleaf would be more honest and efficient, a Taylor administration might offer other hope of reviving the crushed Liberian economy. ""A main disease of this country is an insular complacency,"" said Bill Frank Enoanyi, a columnist and public relations consultant here. While Enoanyi said he did not favor a Taylor presidency, he added that Taylor ""is a hard-driving person"" who could ""jolt Liberians to work."" Another root of Taylor's apparent victory is that, while he may appropriate the country's resources, he also is a master at highly public generosity. For example, Taylor won newspaper headlines last week when he paid $ 23,500 to charter an airplane for the Liberian national soccer team to attend the African Nations Cup tournament in Togo. The Liberian government had said it lacked the money to finance the trip. Taylor funds charities such as the Charles Taylor Educational and Humanitarian Relief Foundation and the Charles Taylor Peace and Unity Child Health Care Center in his home town of Gbarnga, about 90 miles northeast of Monrovia. During the campaign, these institutions stepped up programs such as soup kitchens and other forms of aid to the poor. Taylor has promised magnanimity in victory. On Thursday, a Taylor campaign advertisement promised that a Taylor-led government ""will encourage the principle of voluntary inclusion of Liberians from other parties. . . . We sincerely invite all and look forward to [Johnson-Sirleaf] . . . and many others coming aboard for the betterment of Liberia."" Taylor first came to prominence in Liberia as head of the government's General Services Administration under President Samuel Doe, who took power in a coup in 1980. When Doe accused Taylor of embezzling about $ 900,000 in 1983, Taylor fled to the United States. He was arrested after Doe applied for his extradition, and a U.S. investigation found evidence to support the embezzlement charge. But before his extradition was decided, Taylor broke out of a Massachusetts jail. He reportedly spent time in Libya before turning up at the head of a rebel force that invaded Liberia from Ivory Coast on Christmas Eve 1989. His insurgency reached the gates of Doe's presidential palace in 1990, but Taylor was denied power that year when a West African peace force was dispatched to Liberia and a rival faction seized Doe and killed him. In the years of warfare that followed, his forces established themselves as Liberia's dominant faction, but were never able to seize control of the capital from the Nigerian-led peacekeepers deployed here. The peacekeeping force, which was the principal obstacle to Taylor's taking power, was composed of troops from many West African states and has been financed principally with an estimated $ 500 million from Nigeria but also with more than $ 75 million from the United States. Last year, after attacks by Taylor and others on Monrovia prompted West African states to reinforce the peacekeepers, Taylor and the other warlords agreed to the peace process that resulted in Saturday's election. The peacekeepers are due to stay in Liberia for at least six months after the installation of the new government."3-Aug-97,NIGERIA (94%); UNITED STATES (93%); INDONESIA (79%); GERMANY (79%); PAKISTAN (79%); INDIA (74%); CENTRAL EUROPE (52%);,"For the second year running, a survey of executives and public opinion worldwide has found that Nigeria tops the list of the most corrupt countries to do business, an independent monitoring organization said in a report last week. The third Corruption Perception Index issued by the organization, Transparency International, listed Denmark as the least corrupt place to do business. The United States was ranked the 16th-cleanest country among the 52 nations surveyed for the 1997 report. Introducing this year's survey, Dr. Peter Eigen, a former World Bank official who is chairman of Transparency International, said his five-year-old organization ""is not saying in this index that one country is more corrupt than another."" ""We are reporting how business people around the globe perceive levels of corruption,"" he said. The compilers of the survey acknowledge that some of their information comes from companies involved in corrupt practices. Some are large international corporations frequently criticized by developing nations for indulging or acquiescing in practices that the companies and their governments then condemn. Over the last few years, corruption has become a much more public issue as international aid organizations, like the United Nations Development Program and the World Bank, have warned developing nations that bad reputations are costing them needed investment. In a period of shrinking foreign aid, governments are also under pressure to withhold or reduce assistance because of the perception that a considerable part of the money spent is wasted on bribes and kickbacks. In May, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, representing the world's industrial nations, asked its members to agree this year to pass laws against corrupt practices and to put an end to tax deductibility for bribes paid in business transactions. Frank Vogl, vice chairman of Transparency International, said in an interview on Thursday that the founders of the organization have been surprised by the chord that their message has struck in many capitals, including in the third world. Transparency International has chapters in more than 70 countries and its headquarters in Berlin. It compiles its annual list using information gathered from its own Internet network and from studies made by major polling or risk-analysis organizations -- including Gallup International, the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy of Hong Kong and the DRI/McGraw-Hill Global Risk Service. The list, which is drawn up under the direction of Dr. Johann Graf Lambsdorff, an economist at Gottingen University in Germany, sets 10 as the cleanest score and 0 as the most corrupt. Nations are arrayed on the scale after information from four or more sources is averaged. Nigeria scored a 1.76 this year, substantially lower than the next country most frequently cited for corruption, Bolivia, at 2.05. Other countries scoring under 3 were Colombia, Russia, Pakistan, Mexico, Indonesia, India, Venezuela and Vietnam. At the top of the scale after Denmark, with a 9.94 score, business leaders consider Finland, Sweden, New Zealand, Canada and the Netherlands -- all with scores over 9 -- the least corrupt countries. Among other countries that scored higher than the United States, with a 7.61 rating, were Singapore, Ireland and Israel. The Transparency International list is limited to 52 countries because the compilers do not have enough sources of information to make a fair judgment on other nations, Dr. Lambsdorff said in a statement accompanying the report. At the Nigerian Embassy in Washington, Patrick Ayendi, the information attache, said that the perception of Nigeria as corrupt was no longer based on fact. ""I can tell you very categorically that the present regime in Nigeria has fought corruption down to its barest minimum,"" he said. ""At Government level, if any official is found to be corrupt in Nigeria, you are not only relieved of your duties, you are also prosecuted."" He said the Government welcomed cooperation from other nations where accusations of corruption against Nigerians arise."8-Aug-97,"KENYA (95%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (79%);","The International Monetary Fund, stepping up efforts to combat corruption in the developing world, has adopted a new policy of denying financial assistance to countries where graft threatens to undermine their economic recovery programs. And showing that it means business, the IMF -- which in the past has based most of its lending decisions strictly on economic criteria -- is cutting off a $ 220 million loan to Kenya because of the refusal of Kenyan authorities to clean up pervasive bribery and self-enrichment. Kenya's currency has plunged as much as 20 percent this week as a result. The moves are among the most significant in a series of recent measures taken against corruption by aid agencies, Western governments and international organizations. They come in the wake of criticism aimed at the IMF and other aid donors over the blind eye that they allegedly turned toward rampant bribe-taking in Zaire during much of Mobutu Sese Seko's 32-year reign. Mobutu's corruption and repression spurred a rebellion that toppled him in May, and the nation was renamed Congo. The IMF's new policy, enshrined in guidelines approved Monday by its board, does not mean that IMF money will be withheld from any country where payoffs are common. Rather, it amounts to a warning that the IMF may pull the plug on a country when it believes corruption to be so corrosive as to endanger the attainment of goals specified in a recovery plan. ""Financial assistance from the IMF . . . could be suspended or delayed on account of poor governance,"" the guidelines state, ""if there is reason to believe it could have significant macroeconomic implications that threaten the successful implementation of the program, or if it puts in doubt the purpose of the use of IMF resources."" ""The guidelines are very important,"" said Frank Vogl, vice chairman of Transparency International, an anti-corruption advocacy group. ""It's long overdue that multilateral organizations involved in financing developing countries place on a par with macro policies the basic soundness of the government institutions with which they're dealing."" The cutoff of the loan to Kenya, he added, ""sends a signal, especially because the guidelines are being issued at around the same time."" Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi blasted the IMF's decision as ""purely political,"" according to press reports from Nairobi. The developments reflect a rising determination in Western capitals, especially Washington, to crack down on corruption. IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and World Bank President James D. Wolfensohn have vowed in major policy addresses to take action based on research showing that bribe-taking by public officials tends to impede development, because scarce government funds are funneled into unproductive investments to earn payoffs. The guidelines state that the IMF should not ""interfere in domestic or foreign politics"" of a borrowing country. But they call for its employees to point out the economic consequences of corrupt practices that they may perceive during the periodic consultations they hold with government officials from the IMF's 131 member countries. And in the cases of countries borrowing from the IMF that have been judged to be seriously plagued by corruption, its staff might insist, for example, on ""the removal of individuals from involvement in particular operations where corruption had occurred,"" according to the guidelines. The Kenya loan was suspended late last week because anti-corruption measures the government was taking ""fall short of meeting the clearly expressed concerns of IMF member countries in the area of governance,"" according to an IMF statement. The suspension came just before the board's approval of the guidelines. An IMF official said the move was ""probably the first time that we have said openly that governance issues were at stake"" in such a decision. The suspension followed the Kenyan government's dismissal of its top customs official, Samuel Chebii, who is widely regarded as a crusader for cleaning up corruption in the nation's notoriously graft-ridden ports."11-Aug-97,KENYA (93%); HONG KONG (92%); UNITED STATES (92%); ASIA (79%); CAMBODIA,"At their last annual meeting for the world's finance ministers, the World Bank's president, James D. Wolfensohn, and the International Monetary Fund's managing director, Michel Camdessus, announced that for the first time they would use their leverage with poorer nations to stamp out corruption and to promote better governance. As the finance ministers prepare to gather in Hong Kong next month for the next annual meeting, the first fruits of that new policy are starting to become visible. This month the Monetary Fund sent the Kenya shilling and the Nairobi stock market into a tailspin. It suspended a $220 million loan to Kenya after President Daniel arap Moi failed to create the powerful new anticorruption authority the fund had demanded and to reinstate Samuel Chebii, who had been dismissed as Commissioner for Customs and Excise. Mr. Chebii had earned a formidable reputation for combating graft, to the Government's evident discomfort. At the same time, the fund's executive board, which represents its member governments, formally agreed that all such assistance to third-world countries can be suspended as a matter of course in the future if government corruption is found to be having an adverse effect on a nation's economic development. The World Bank uses the faith and credit of its member countries to borrow inexpensively on financial markets and lends that money to poorer nations. The fund makes loans to distressed governments provided that they adopt policies it favors. While the fund said it was not changing its traditional view that reducing inflation, controlling Government spending and promoting ""macroeconomic stability"" remain the principal keys to growth, it made clear that it would put increased emphasis on fighting corruption and promoting better governance in countries it aids. Financial assistance ""could be suspended or delayed on account of poor governance, if there is reason to believe it could have significant macroeconomic implications,"" state new guidelines on governance questions adopted by the fund's board earlier this month. The fund also showed a new readiness this month to interpret what it means by good governance quite broadly when it persuaded Romania to cancel a planned $1 billion purchase of 96 Cobra attack helicopters from an American company, Bell Helicopter, a division of Textron Inc. Romania had hoped the purchase of sophisticated American military hardware would speed its entry into NATO, although the alliance's secretary general, Javier Solana, said the purchase was unnecessary. The fund contended that such a large arms purchase risked disrupting the economic reforms to which Romania had agreed in return for a loan, by shifting money away from health and education programs that the fund considers more important for the country's successful transition to capitalism. Last year the fund also showed its teeth in Asia by suspending disbursements on a $120 million loan to Cambodia for six months after anticipated Government revenues from logging concessions did not materialize. Next month, it will be the World Bank's turn to publish a three-pronged plan for combatting corruption and promoting better governance. The bank already took the first step last year when it tightened procurement rules governing contracts financed by the $19 billion in loans it disburses annually, saying it will disqualify companies it considers corrupt and require those bidding for contracts to open their books to the bank's auditors. The bank also is to recruit more procurement specialists to oversee the awarding of contracts, at an annual cost of $13 million, and to encourage third-world governments to include a pledge in projects it finances to take steps to prevent bribery. Finally, it plans to step up assistance to governments developing anticorruption strategies. It is already helping several countries develop strategies, including Latvia, Tanzania, Uganda and Ukraine. Unlike the fund -- which usually makes just one loan to a government and which can suspend it at will -- the bank tends to have several loans outstanding at the same time in various sectors of any third-world country's economy where conditions may vary considerably. So it plans a more selective approach to delinquent countries, making decisions on its lending on a project-by-project basis until it is satisfied with the way they are all being run. ""You will see us giving a much higher profile to governance and corruption concerns in a selective way, delaying disbursement until we are satisfied, or suspending it altogether"" said Masood Ahmed, who is coordinating the bank's new policies in this area. In an early example of this approach, Mr. Wolfensohn recently delayed the $70 million second installment of a $150 million loan to a Kenyan energy project because of doubts about the way it was being run. He also delayed a health services loan to Kenya until the bank was satisfied with procurement procedures. The bank also has suspended operations in several countries where it believes its money is unlikely to benefit ordinary people because of endemic corruption and inefficiency -- including Nigeria, the Sudan, Congo and Afghanistan. In deciding to fight corruption and promote better government, both institutions have had to reinterpret requirements in their own bylaws that all lending should be based on economic considerations alone and should take no account of a country's politics. In its new governance guidelines, the fund makes clear that its judgments still ""should not be influenced by the nature of a political regime of a country, nor should it interfere in domestic or foreign politics of any member."" But it also concedes that staff ""may need to be prepared to face some tension in the working relationship with country authorities in specific cases potentially involving corrupt practices."" Both institutions now contend that corruption and bad governance are in themselves obstacles to economic development, as are poor education, inadequate infrastructure and an ineffective health care system, all of which they have previously accepted as within the scope of their responsibility."17-Aug-97,KENYA (94%); RWANDA (92%); AFRICA (92%); EASTERN AFRICA (92%); UGANDA (92%);,"The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have provided the summer's most welcome change in the way global finance and business operate. But they have also furnished a jarring reminder to prognosticators that things often fail to work out as we think they will. Kenya is at the center of the international bankers' reforms and the failure of past conventional wisdom. Because of corruption, the two world financial institutions have suspended loans to the government of President Daniel arap Moi, who also faces bloody street protests because of his dictatorial rule. When I lived in Kenya in the early 1970s as Africa correspondent for The Post, there were two firm bits of conventional wisdom about that beautiful East African nation: One was that Moi, a politician of limited intellectual ability who hailed from a minor tribe, was a transitional figure who could not survive long as president. The other was that Kenya's resources, international visibility and dynamic society should enable it to overcome its crippling internal ethnic rivalries and become a great African success story. Neither prediction looks very good today. Moi's unshakable hold on power for nearly 20 years has been accompanied by a steady decline in the nation's stability and prosperity. There can be little doubt now that the two factors are intimately connected. When the Central Intelligence Agency commissioned an independent study on why states fail two years ago, political leadership was listed among the leading indicators of national catastrophe. East Africa today provides confirmation of this in several ways. Uganda and Rwanda, after enduring terrible bloodlettings and economic collapse, have emerged from their times of trouble with secure and assertive political leadership. Rwanda's Paul Kagame and Uganda's Yoweri Museveni have, through their support of change in the Congo, sketched the basis for a promising regional alliance that is likely to gain increasing international support. But they still must overcome the other failed-state criteria the CIA-commissioned study lists: infant mortality, population pressure, closed trade borders, weather, ethnic tensions and more. The study recommended an official ""watch list"" of countries that get in the trouble zone. It is unclear if the agency ever established such an indelicate document for policymakers. A Michelin guide to political turmoil could be a bestseller in international circles. But you can understand the agency's reluctance to acknowledge that it is watching for three-star hellholes to come. Imagine the hurt feelings, and expulsions of spooks, that would follow. Would a country like Kenya make such a list today, despite all the advantages it still has over its neighbors? It is a measure of Kenya's intrinsic strength that it has been going downhill every year for two decades in the eyes of many of its citizens, former residents and visitors, but still works as a center of global tourism and as a regional headquarters for business and international organizations. The pragmatism of founding President Jomo Kenyatta and his advisers -- as well as the munificence of Kenya's glorious wildlife reserves, tea and coffee plantations and seaside resorts -- gave Moi a substantial heritage to squander after he came to power in 1978, on Kenyatta's death. Moi had been chosen as Kenyatta's vice president in part to secure a tribal alliance between Kenyatta's Kikuyu and Moi's Kalinjin followers. The Kikuyu politicians who squabbled over succeeding Kenyatta let Moi come to power on the theory that they could easily manipulate him and toss him aside later. That was a disastrous miscalculation. Moi divided and conquered the Kikuyu, shuffling the army and internal security commands into the hands of his tribesmen and allies. He let corruption flourish to buy off his more pliable opponents, using harsher measures against others. But Moi's misrule is now being challenged in the streets of Nairobi, where his police killed five demonstrators in one recent protest, and in the board rooms of the world's leading international financial institutions. In a departure from past practice, the International Monetary Fund this month suspended a $ 220 million loan to Kenya because Moi failed to create a strong anti-corruption authority demanded by the fund. The World Bank has also recently delayed smaller loans to Kenya because of concern about corruption. This apparently coordinated squeeze on official corruption in Kenya -- and presumably elsewhere in the future -- is a welcome innovation. International organizations have for too long averted their eyes and treated corruption as an internal matter beyond their reach. Flagrant corruption that is tolerated or assisted by national governments is not a matter of sovereignty. It is a cancer on the international system as well as on the national state. It should be identified and fought far more quickly than it has been in the past. The predicament becomes even more acute as Russia and China pursue their efforts to integrate into the global economy. The forms of corruption that plague these two ex-centrally planned economies differ, but raise many of the same problems present in Kenya. Corruption on a national scale is a proper target for international condemnation and action as well as intelligence scrutiny."22-Aug-97,KENYA (99%); UNITED STATES (92%); EUROPE (79%); JAPAN (79%);,"A Kenyan court charged 62 suspects today with robbery and violence during a raid on a police station that began a week of attacks around this port city that some observers said were politically motivated. Despite the political turmoil, the International Monetary Fund said it was sending a team to Kenya for talks on resuming aid. ""To show our goodwill in this respect, I have asked a mission to leave immediately for Nairobi,"" the Fund's managing director, Michel Camdessus, told reporters in Washington. He said the decision followed a personal appeal from President Daniel arap Moi. The I.M.F. suspended a $205 million, three-year loan to Kenya on July 31 citing concerns over corruption. The World Bank followed suit and delayed disbursements. Mr. Moi, 73 and in power since 1978, faces elections later this year for which no date has been set. He had accused the I.M.F. of acting on political grounds. The 62 suspects in Mombasa court were accused of robbing the police station at Likoni on Aug. 13, killing a policeman, stealing weapons including 40 rifles and damaging property. They were also charged with arson and taking an unlawful oath binding them to kill if called on to do so. The maximum penalty for robbery with violence is death. The accused included Amir Hamisi Ali Banda, prayer leader of a mosque south of Mombasa, and Ali Said Chidzondo, chairman of the unregistered National African Democratic Union. All denied the charges and were scheduled to appear again in two weeks. Security forces beat the opposition leader Raila Odinga and damaged his car today when he tried to visit the Likoni police station with other opposition activists, local journalists said. ""One of them hit me with the butt of his gun on the side of my head,"" Mr. Odinga told reporters.""This confirms our fears that the Government has something to hide."" A police spokesman, Peter Kimanthi, said he was unaware of the incident. But he confirmed that the police had shot and killed a man at Tiwi village south of Mombasa on Wednesday. This took the toll from nine days of violence to 40 dead. Six policemen and seven civilians including five attackers were killed on Aug. 13 in the well-organized attack on the Likoni police station, just south of Mombasa. Mr. Kimanthi said the police recovered a rifle today and 50 rounds of ammunition and arrested 101 people, taking the number of arrests since Aug. 13 to at least 410. President Moi and the opposition have blamed each other for fueling tribal tensions on the coast. Missions of 10 European countries, the United States and Japan welcomed an agreement in principle by Government and opposition to start talks before elections. ""We urge both sides to enter into dialogue in the spirit of compromise and with the commitment to agree on reforms necessary to ensure free and fair elections,"" they said in a statement. The attacks on the coast, the center of Kenya's tourism and its top foreign currency earner, have shaken the industry and tour operators say cancellations have increased. Tourism earned $465 million in 1996 and is Kenya's top employer. About 60 percent of last year's 770,000 tourists went to beaches to the north and south of Mombasa."8-Sep-97,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (95%); MOROCCO (94%); AFRICA (93%); SOUTH AFRICA (92%); FRANCE (90%); EUROPE (79%); SWITZERLAND (79%); CENTRAL EUROPE (57%); BELGIUM (53%);","Mobutu Sese Seko, 66, whose despotic and corrupt regime ruled Congo -- the country he called Zaire -- for 32 years before he was toppled in a civil war last May, died last night in Rabat, Morocco, where he had lived in exile since his ouster. Mobutu, who had long suffered from prostate cancer, was admitted to Mohamed V military hospital in late June for treatment of internal bleeding and never left; the official Moroccan news agency said Mobutu died there ""after a long illness"" but gave no further details. He had spent most of the final year of his rule in Switzerland and France, where he underwent surgery and intensive therapy in an effort to arrest the advancing disease. The Reuter news agency quoted diplomatic sources in Rabat as saying the former ruler's second wife, Bobi Ladawa, and other family members were at his bedside when he died and that Mobutu, a Roman Catholic, would be buried in Rabat's Christian cemetery. At the same time, however, the new Congo government did not rule out burial in the country of his birth. ""Why shouldn't the body be repatriated?"" Reuter quoted Information Minister Raphael Ghenda as saying. ""While he was alive, we said we would be happy for him to return."" Mobutu fled his capital, Kinshasa, on May 16, one day before a powerful rebel force led by Laurent Kabila marched into the city to claim victory in a seven-month civil war and supplant a reign of corruption that had made Mobutu a billionaire and left Africa's third-largest country and its 48 million people in poverty and chaos. France, a country he considered his second home, and several other nations in Africa and Europe refused to grant him political refuge before Morocco's King Hassan II agreed to give him asylum. Mobutu, a former army sergeant who rose to become commander in chief, president and one of Africa's patriarchal ""big men,"" seized power in the former Belgian Congo by means of a coup in 1965. At the time, the country was reeling from almost continuous bloody strife that began when it gained independence five years earlier. Although over the years he had to contend with periodic insurgencies at home and invasions from abroad, Mobutu was credited with providing his mineral-rich and strategically placed homeland with a measure of peace and stability. During the Cold War, he was hailed in the West as a bulwark against communism. Mobutu stayed in office through political guile, the sharing of graft with colleagues and potential enemies, outright oppression -- including torture and murder -- and a marked ability for making himself seem indispensable. Twice during the civil war that brought about his downfall, he returned from France to a hero's welcome, assuring his people that his stature and presence alone would be enough to restore peace in the land -- a pledge the millions pinned their hopes on. Each time time he failed, and the war went on, ultimately to his eclipse. Throughout most of his career, Mobutu received crucial aid from foreign allies with varying strategic, economic, political and commercial interests in West Africa. His chief patron for much of that time was the United States, which provided about $ 2 billion in foreign assistance. In return, Washington got a secure base for operations in neighboring Angola, where Western-backed UNITA rebels were locked in a long civil war with a Marxist government supported by Cuban troops and Soviet arms. France and Belgium were key Mobutu allies in Europe. At crucial points, both sent paratroops to help him quell disturbances. So did Morocco. France was granted a base in his country for operations in Chad and elsewhere in its former African empire. At stake was a country that covers half the area of the United States, shares borders with nine other African nations and holds vast potential wealth. Its mineral resources include 65 percent of the world's known reserves of cobalt and large deposits of copper, tin, uranium, gold, oil and diamonds. The nation also was subject to enormous centrifugal forces that threatened to tear it apart since the day it gained independence. Its borders were drawn to settle rivalries between colonial powers without respect for ethnicity, language, culture, natural features or other factors that go into making a nation. With no tradition of statehood or economic reason to look to the central government, its regions tended toward autonomy. Mobutu sought to hold the nation together by making it more ""authentically"" African and by presenting himself as its creator and savior. In 1971, he changed its name, and that of the great river that runs through it, from Congo to Zaire. The following year, he changed his own name. The former Joseph-Desire Mobutu became Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu wa za Banga, which, according to an official translation, means, ""The all-powerful warrior who, because of his inflexible will to win, will go from conquest to conquest leaving fire in his wake."" Mobutu also made himself the object of a personality cult that would have done credit to any dictator. In the controlled news media he was referred to by such names as the Guide, the Father of the Nation, the Messiah. Television pictured him descending god-like from the clouds. His mother was compared to the Virgin Mary. His picture was everywhere. Always he was shown wearing his sartorial signature -- a leopard-skin hat and a high-collared, shirt-like jacket similar to those favored by China's Mao Zedong. Mobutu designed it himself to replace the Western jacket and tie with a garment he said was African, and he directed that Zairian men wear it on formal occasions. His hold over Zairians was almost mystical. In a land where superstition is an important part of the culture, it was rumored, for example, that the carved black walking stick he always carried in public had magical powers and was so heavy a normal person could not lift it. While deifying himself, Mobutu closed off avenues that might permit rivals to challenge him. The army was purposely kept weak, although there was a well-paid, well-armed military auxiliary called the Presidential Division. Until 1990, the only political party that was allowed to exist was the Popular Movement of the Revolution, described officially as ""the nation politically organized."" Politics aside, the defining characteristic of Mobutu's rule was corruption, and he was the chief beneficiary, gaining a fortune estimated at anywhere from $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion. Stealing was so widespread that the word ""kleptocracy"" was coined to describe the regime. In a speech in 1977, Mobutu described his country in terms that might have been taken from a World Bank report. ""Everything is for sale, anything can be bought in our country,"" he said. ""And in this flow, he who holds the slightest cover of public authority uses it illegally to acquire money, goods, prestige, or to avoid obligations."" Graft was Mobutu's first choice as a way of rewarding friends and disarming foes. He suggested only that it be done discreetly. ""If you want to steal, steal a little in a nice way,"" he once said. ""But if you steal too much to get rich overnight, you'll be caught."" Mobutu had extensive holdings in Zaire, as well as deposits and estates in Europe. For visits abroad, he sometimes chartered a Concorde. In the 1980s, he imported 5,000 sheep from Venezuela for one of his ranches; he did it by ordering a government-owned DC-8 to make 32 round trips between Caracas and Zaire. His most ambitious project was the rebuilding of Gbadolite, his ancestral village. In 1965 it had a population of 1,700; by the 1980s it was a city of 37,000, complete with modern water and sewage systems, street lights, telephones that worked and a palace, a luxury hotel and an airport capable of handling large jet aircraft. Mobutu often was compared to King Leopold II of Belgium, who in 1876 claimed the Congo as private property to be exploited for his private gain. The king extracted an enormous fortune in rubber and ivory while leaving a record of brutality that was virtually unmatched in the colonial era -- severed heads to quell any idea of resistance, severed hands as the penalty for failing to meet production targets. In 1904, Leopold was forced by outraged world opinion to abdicate, and the colony was annexed by the Belgian government. Nearly a century later, Zairians barely eked out an existence as they coped with the consequences of Mobutu's misrule. Under his leadership, a nation with seemingly unlimited prospects became one of the poorest in the world. By the late 1980s, per capita income was less than a tenth of what it had been at independence. In the 1990s, the degree of poverty dropped below measurable levels. Hyperinflation rendered the currency worthless. Barter was the usual means of exchange. The country's infrastructure collapsed. Only one paved road in 10 that existed at independence survived into the 1990s. There was no way to get the products of the country's once thriving farms to market. The Zaire River became virtually the only form of surface transportation, but there were few boats to ply it. Fifty percent of the country's children died by age 5. Schools and hospitals closed. But in the context of the Cold War, Mobutu's peculation and abuse of human rights counted for less in Washington than his anticommunist credentials. Mobutu first became an ""asset"" of the CIA in 1959 during a meeting in Brussels. He made his first visit to the White House in 1963, when he was still chief of staff of his nation's army, as a guest of President John F. Kennedy. President Ronald Reagan twice welcomed him to Washington and called him ""a voice of good sense and goodwill."" President George Bush entertained him at his summer retreat in Maine. By the early 1990s, however, the conditions that had made him a valuable ally had changed. The great rivalry between Washington and Moscow had been settled in Washington's favor. U.S. diplomats began to suggest that the time had come for Mobutu to step aside. But Washington also had to acknowledge that while it had done much to advance Mobutu's career, it could not bring it to an end when it wished. Mobutu was born in Lisala, in the Congo's Equateur Province, on Oct. 30, 1930. His father was a cook, his mother a hotel maid. He attended a Catholic school and then was selected by Belgian colonial authorities to go to the Institut d'Etudes Sociales de l'Etat in Brussels. In 1949, after a year of study, he returned home and joined the Force Publique, the colonial army. He rose to the rank of sergeant major, the highest available to a Congolese. In 1956, he turned to journalism and politics, working on newspapers and magazines in Leopoldville, now Kinshasa. In 1958, he joined the Mouvement Nationale Congolais, a political party founded by Patrice Lumumba, a left-leaning nationalist; the party's program was independence for the Congo. A year later, rioting broke out in the colony, and the Brussels government abruptly decided to grant independence. Little had been done to prepare for it -- out of a population of about 15 million at the time there were only 16 university graduates. In January 1960, a conference met in Brussels to work out details. The question of independence having been decided beforehand, the most difficult issue facing the conference was the form of the new state -- a strong central government or broad regional autonomy. Lumumba favored the former; representatives of the copper-rich province of Katanga, now called Shaba, favored the latter. Having been jailed for agitation, Lumumba could not attend the meeting. Mobutu went as his chief representative and successfully argued for a centralized regime. On June 20, 1960, Belgium transferred power to a coalition government in which Joseph Kasavubu was president, Lumumba premier and Mobutu defense minister. Eight days later, the army revolted and turned on its Belgian officers. On July 11, Katanga seceded under the leadership of Moise Tshombe. Subsequently, secessionist movements arose in Kasai and Orientale provinces, and the Congo was plunged into a crisis that seemed to confirm the worst fears of Africa's friends about the continent's ability to govern itself. For Mobutu, the situation provided a road to power. He gained it by exploiting disputes among his rivals. His first opportunity came less than three months after independence and involved Kasavubu and Lumumba. Over the president's objections, the premier appealed to the United States for help in ending the Katangan revolt; when he was refused, he turned to the Soviet Union. Moscow responded with arms and money. Meanwhile, the CIA station chief in Leopoldville cabled Washington that the Congo was ""experiencing classic communist effort takeover government. Whether or not Lumumba actually commie or just playing commie game to assist solidifying power, anti-West forces rapidly increasing power Congo and there may be little time left in which take action avoid another Cuba."" He was authorized to take steps to protect U.S. interests. In August 1960, the United Nations sent a military force to the Congo. European mercenaries assisted Katanga and Tshombe, while the Congolese army, brought under control by Mobutu after its mutiny in June, made up yet another force. As the summer wore on, Lumumba prepared to oust Kasavubu; on Sept. 14, before he could act, Mobutu staged a coup and announced that all politicians had been ""neutralized."" Lumumba fled the capital. Two months later, he was caught and turned over to Tshombe in Katanga, and, in February 1961, he was killed. In the communist world he was revered as a martyr; Mobutu and the CIA were implicated in his death. With Lumumba out of the way, Mobutu turned the government over to Kasavubu, who installed Cyrille Adoula as premier. The secession in Katanga lasted until 1963 and ended only after a war between U.N. and Katangese forces during which Tshombe fled to Spain. In 1964, however, Kasavubu fired Adoula and persuaded Tshombe to return to the Congo and take the premiership. The former leader of Katangese independence now became a champion of the central government with the responsibility of ending revolts in the eastern Congo. But he soon found himself at loggerheads with Kasavubu and was dismissed in 1965. On Nov. 25, 1965, Mobutu intervened again and led the bloodless coup that put him in power for nearly the rest of his life in the country he renamed Zaire. In 1966 and 1967, Mobutu had to put down revolts by Tshombe's former gendarmes in Shaba, and between 1975 and 1978, he was threatened by invasions of the region by forces of the opposition Congolese National Liberation Front, then based in Angola. In the same period, he sent Congolese troops to support the UNITA rebel movement in Angola. In the end, however, he began to lose his grip as a result of mismanagement and graft. As the economy declined, opposition increased. And as unrest grew, the regime cracked down harder and harder. In one incident, students were killed during a demonstration in Lubumbashi, the capital of Shaba. The United States responded by cutting off all aid except humanitarian assistance. As Cold War-era leaders around him began to fall, Mobutu hung on with promises of reform, but his vow in 1990 to hold multi-party elections was never fulfilled, and opposition marches were met with military force. In 1991 and 1993, riots by the Zairian army, which had not been paid, tipped the situation into free-fall crisis. Kinshasa and other cities were looted with heavy loss of life. As he grew ever more isolated, Mobutu spent most of his time in Gbadolite or living on a yacht on the Zaire River. In 1994, however, he regained a measure of support when he allowed international aid organizations into the country to care for more than 1 million refugees who had fled tribal warfare in Rwanda. The exodus began when extremists among Rwanda's Hutu majority went on a killing rampage against the Tutsi minority and massacred hundreds of thousands of them. A Tutsi-led rebel force then seized power, triggering a flood of Hutu refugees who feared Tutsi reprisal. Although many refugees returned home in 1996, an estimated 350,000 Hutus, uncertain of the fate awaiting them at home, remained in Zaire. There they exacerbated Kinshasa's relations with Zairian Tutsis, who joined forces with Laurent Kabila when he began his rebellion last October. Mobutu vowed again early this year to hold elections and said he would ask the voters to retain him in power -- determined, as he said, never to be called ""the ex-president of Zaire."" But the civil war and the relentless advance of Kabila's troops made the issue moot. On March 23 of this year, Mobutu met with reporters for the first time since returning to Zaire two days earlier with the promise that he would bring peace and order out of the chaos -- even as Kabila's forces were marching almost unopposed toward Kinshasa. ""I am Mobutu, I am Mobutu,"" he intoned as he stood outside his mansion in a garden in which peacocks strutted. ""I didn't come back to busy myself with my own interests and my own future, as you have been writing from time to time. I am here to concentrate on the higher interests of Zaire -- this is to say, our unity and out territorial integrity."" It was a familiar refrain, but by the time he was driven into his final exile just weeks later, it was clear that few people were listening."5-Oct-97,"AFRICA (93%); UNITED STATES (92%); ERITREA (79%); ETHIOPIA (79%); RWANDA (79%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (79%); UGANDA (79%); CENTRAL AFRICA (79%); SOUTHERN AFRICA (71%);","CONGO PRESIDENT Laurent Kabila's refusal to permit a United Nations team to investigate alleged massacres of refugees in his country has presented the U.N., the United States and others with a new danger. Congo should not be isolated under its new leadership, with its people continuing to languish as they did under Mr. Kabila's predecessor, longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. But the U.N., the World Bank and developed nations must make clear, in unison, that Mr. Kabila cannot expect the aid and trade his country needs as long as he stonewalls on these terrible massacre issues. Last May Mr. Kabila and his troops completed an astonishingly swift march across Zaire, as one of Africa's largest and most populous nations was then known, and toppled the corrupt and rotting dictatorship of Mr. Mobutu, who has since died. Most of the world's leaders welcomed Mr. Kabila's success, grudgingly at first and then more effusively once his victory appeared inevitable. Much help was promised for the rebuilding of Congo, which is rich in natural resources but poor by almost every other measure. But much alarm also was expressed at well-documented reports of ethnically generated massacres that had taken place during Mr. Kabila's campaign. Aid would depend on the new government's cooperation with investigations and humanitarian missions to remaining refugees, thought to number 200,000 or more. Since then, however, the U.N. has met with nothing but obstacles. U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has gone a long way to accommodate Mr. Kabila's concerns -- too long, in the view of some critics. The U.N. replaced the leader of its human rights mission, at Mr. Kabila's insistence, and broadened the mission's mandate to include alleged crimes by Mr. Kabila's vanquished foes as well as by his own troops. Yet even so, Mr. Kabila has kept the team bottled up in the capital -- while evidence is reportedly erased. He now threatens to expel the U.N. team altogether. Apart from his troops' alleged complicity in the massacres, Mr. Kabila has some understandable reasons to stiff the international community. The world's rich countries ignored him and propped up Mr. Mobutu all these years, he may well feel; why should he play ball now? In addition, Congo's new president can be seen as one of a new, post-post-colonial generation of African leaders who are determined to establish true independence. The heads of Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda and Rwanda likewise see that dependence on foreign aid has gotten their countries nowhere, and they want to be more self-supporting. It's a trend that should be welcomed, one that offers real hope for long-postponed development in central and southern Africa. Still, all these countries remain poor and dependent on outside help -- if not traditional foreign aid, then investment, debt forgiveness and trade. The U.N., the World Bank and major donor nations need to work together to convince Mr. Kabila that he won't get such help if he doesn't cooperate on human rights and humanitarian aid. But as Oxfam International points out in a new report, that kind of threat won't mean a thing unless the donors also are prepared to offer substantial aid and incentives. If Mr. Kabila insists on isolating Congo, no one can stop him. But a united international community can make it very, very tough for him to do so."5-Oct-97,KENYA (96%);,"The political stalemate that has led to violence here over the last six months has been broken, after President Daniel arap Moi's agreement last week with opposition leaders on reforms that would level the playing field somewhat before the coming election. Opposition leaders and diplomats said it remained to be seen if the governing party would carry out the reforms as promised, or if the police and local officials would follow the laws once they were enacted. But as debate began on the bills in Parliament, hopes for a peaceful election began rising here in the capital as well as in the port city of Mombasa, where more than 50 people have been killed in ethnic clashes since August. ""It looks like a big breakthrough,"" a diplomat said, insisting on anonymity. ""The big question is: will the reforms be implemented in sufficiently good faith?"" Diplomats said the proposed reforms are not mere window dressing. If passed, they would mark significant concessions by Mr. Moi, who only three months ago vowed that he would allow no political changes before the general election, which must be held by the end of this year. Mr. Moi, 73, has been in power since 1979 and is a product of the one-party system erected by Jomo Kenyatta, the country's first President. He resisted multiparty democracy until 1992, when domestic and international pressure finally forced Kenya's Government to change. But for the first free election in 1992, Mr. Moi's party -- the Kenya African National Union -- used the machinery of the state to undercut challengers. Mr. Moi garnered the largest block of votes, about 38 percent, because the opposition splintered along tribal lines and could not unite behind a single candidate. This year, the major opposition leaders vowed they would not take part in the election unless the rules were changed to give challengers a better chance and unless civil liberties were expanded. More than a dozen people were killed in prodemocracy demonstrations over the summer. The unrest undermined Kenya's tourist industry and battered its currency. With the economy reeling, Mr. Moi and his Cabinet appeared to be in trouble just a month ago. Not only was Kenya facing international condemnation for violently breaking up demonstrations, but it was also fending off threats from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to suspend aid because of official corruption. Over the last three weeks, however, moderate backbenchers from the governing party reached out to moderate opposition leaders in Parliament and found some common ground, politicians and diplomats said. Some older opposition politicians said the umbrella coalition that had organized the summer's protests had been taken over by radicals intent on overthrowing Mr. Moi rather than changing the Constitution. Many moderates in the coalition became disenchanted with the movement after protesters beat two police officers to death at a rally in early August. ""I found out that we had reached a stage where, for us who were purely for reforms, we were being taken for a ride,"" said Martin Shikuku, an opposition party leader and presidential aspirant. ""We folded up the umbrella, and we went into discussions, and the result is that we have managed to get much more than we envisioned."" Later Mr. Moi endorsed the raft of reforms that moderates on both sides of the aisle had hammered out in Parliament. Diplomats say his change of heart appears to be motivated partly by the threat of a loss of foreign aid and tourism. But in practice, the proposed bills have also divided his political enemies and tripped up the coalition of civil-rights advocates, clergy and politicians who had been pressing for constitutional change. Some of the more radical civil-rights advocates and opposition leaders are still holding out for greater changes, saying the proposed reforms are cosmetic. But they are having trouble rallying support. A protest called last weekend to burn voter-registration cards drew only a handful of people. The reformers' umbrella coalition -- known as the National Convention Executive Council -- has called off strikes scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday. Among other things, the bills would do away with sedition laws that give the Government the right to hold people without trial for political reasons, and would grant greater freedom of assembly. They would also make the police department independent of the governing party and make it a felony for the police to harass or jail people on political grounds. The reforms would also expand the electoral commission to give opposition parties 10 more seats."29-Oct-97,AFRICA (95%); UNITED STATES (94%); EUROPE (92%); ASIA (92%); ERITREA (79%); RWANDA (79%); NORTH AMERICA (79%); JAPAN (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (71%);,"U.N. AMBASSADOR Bill Richardson set off for Africa last week bad-mouthing his own chances of success. Yet the U.N. ambassador managed to secure from Congo President Laurent Kabila a promise to allow, finally, a U.N. investigation of massacres and human rights abuses. It's too soon to know whether these welcome words will be backed up with action. But it's not too soon for the United Nations, United States and other interested parties to take maximum advantage of the opening Ambassador Richardson and President Kabila have provided. ""We are looking at a more coherent overall policy for the Great Lakes region,"" Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said yesterday. That's an urgent task. The turmoil that has rocked financial markets from Asia to North America to Europe in recent days has left Africa largely unscathed -- not because Africa is more economically sound but because it so much less integrated into the world economy. At a time like this, that might seem an advantage -- but it's not. While incomes in Asia have grown over the past two decades -- and will likely continue to grow despite the current troubles -- Africa risks being left behind altogether. Now, though, a new generation of self-made, self-confident leaders has come to power in much of the continent, from South Africa north to Eritrea. Their record is short thus far and mixed, but many of them proclaim a commitment to reining in corruption, promoting economic growth, fostering more responsive government and tying their nations to the world economy. The Great Lakes region at the continent's heart, and particularly Congo with its 65 million people, are crucial to this movement, and to Africa's stability. Mr. Kabila's performance thus far has been disappointing -- particularly his refusal to permit a U.N. inquiry into credible allegations of massacres and terrible mistreatment of refugees. He and others in the region are suspicious of the United Nations and Western nations, in part because they propped up the dictator Mobutu for so many years, in part because the West did little to prevent genocidal massacres in Rwanda in 1994. That resentment, however, cannot excuse Mr. Kabila's stonewalling. His progress makes possible a measure of progress in other parts of the West's relationship with Congo. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund should join with the United Nations, the United States, Japan and the European Union to fashion a constructive policy. One element must be relief from Mobutu's massive debts. Aid and trade must figure in too. This isn't something the United States can do alone, but it's something that isn't likely to happen at all without U.S. leadership."20-Nov-97,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (93%); AFRICA (79%);","Mile 42 on National Highway No. 1 was the end of the line for Nsimba Ndona, who makes his living driving a truck hauling boards from the capital, Kinshasa, to Congo's only seaport, Matadi. At a point just shy of this town, Mr. Ndona's truck foundered in a sea of mud that swamps the route every year throughout Congo's long equatorial rainy season, putting him in the company of about 400 other drivers of heavy trucks now stranded along the 210-mile route to the sea. ""We are waiting for the Government to do something,"" Mr. Ndona said. ""It's up to them to make the decision to repair the road. My boss just tells me: 'Go. Do whatever you can.' "" The situation of this driver is not unlike the situation of his country. Six months after the rebel forces led by Laurent Kabila routed the longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, Congo's new Government shows scant promise of cleaning up the economic wreck Mr. Kabila inherited. The Government's policies, Congolese and foreign business people who deal with it say, are a hodgepodge of 1960's third-world statism, 1990's World Bank liberalism and a no-holds-barred frontier capitalism, characterized by shady business deals struck with international mining tycoons. Most disturbing, they say, are signs that old habits of deep corruption are not dead. On Dec. 3 Mr. Kabila's Government will attend its first major meeting with international lenders in Brussels. Although Congo boasts one of the world's richest arrays of natural resources, after three decades of misrule by Mr. Mobutu it ranks as one of Africa's poorest nations. So the new President is clearly hoping for hundreds of millions of dollars to be made available to help begin the work of rebuilding the country's economy. The obstacles to any major new aid packages loom as large as the gulf between this country's reality and its promise. The hurdles range from a long-stalled investigation of wartime atrocities and restrictions on political liberties to a crippling $14 billion debt left over from the Mobutu era and a fast-spreading reputation for official corruption that is taking the bloom off Mr. Kabila's image as a nationalistic righter of wrongs. ""There is little immediate prospect for an economic resurrection here,"" said one pessimistic Western diplomat. ""Kabila may have taken over the country, but he has done very little so far to change the economic realities of the Congo. ""Kinshasa, like just about every other city, is cut off from the rest of the country, except for a trickle of river traffic. What you are left with is not so much a national economy, but a collection of micro-economies, and the scary thing is that it is becoming difficult to see how things are going to get better."" The daunting scope of the task ahead was acknowledged the other day in a rare press briefing given by a handful of Mr. Kabila's ministers. The ministers said the Government's top priority would be the construction or rehabilitation of 13,000 miles of roads -- a job that they estimated would cost $2.5 billion. One minister said $530 million was needed right away to buy 2,000 tractors and other supplies needed to restart the country's devastated agricultural sector. Hundreds of millions more will be needed, it was said, to construct electrification projects, to supply safe drinking water and to rescue the country's dilapidated health care system. ""Our principal preoccupation is the welfare of the people,"" said Energy Minister Pierre Lokombe Kitele, adding that the Government wanted to focus on ""ending the misery of people in the countryside, who should benefit from the riches of this country just as much as we do."" But with the treasury empty and international development assistance still on hold, Mr. Kabila's Government has work to do at marketing its two most salable assets: the country's fabulously rich deposits of minerals -- copper, cobalt, zinc, diamonds and gold, among others -- and a huge oversupply of electricity from one of the world's biggest hydroelectric dams, at Inga on the Congo River. A few foreign investors have given Mr. Kabila's team high marks for its handling of business matters. ""I have only dealt with two ministers: mining and finance,"" said Norman J. Gross, a Washington-based investor looking for deals in the mining sector. ""I have found each of them to be straightforward and to have a genuine interest in the welfare of the people."" But many other business executives and foreign diplomats said the Government has begun to cut corners in ways that for some already recall the worst of the Mobutu days. One supplier of electrical equipment, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Government officials placing an order for $2 million in goods had asked that they be billed $4 million, allowing them to pocket the difference. The businessman said that he had declined the request but that discussions were continuing. Others say they have been told that to get Government approval for their deals, they must deposit large payments in a newly created bank whose shareholders are widely reported in the local press to be close associates of Mr. Kabila. ""There are a lot of new businesses out there where if you did right by Kabila in the past, a lot of opportunities open up to you,"" said one foreign businessman who has had extensive dealings with the new Government. ""There are lots of deals that are being held up, ostensibly for reasons of paperwork, but which really have to do with money and connections. This has already begun to shake investor confidence pretty badly."" The deal that is being most talked about in Kinshasa these days is one of the first that Mr. Kabila's team made -- even before it captured the capital in May -- and one whose threatened collapse could have disastrous consequences for the Government. Under an agreement signed in April in Lubumbashi, the capital of the southern mining region, a company registered in the United States, American Mineral Fields, agreed to invest $350 million over the next three years in a copper mining project at Kolwezi. The signing, before the fall of Kinshasa, was considered a major coup in the industry, and company officials say that on the basis of their agreement, they have spent more than $10 million on surveys and site preparation. But people close to the Government and people close to American Mineral Fields separately confirmed that when the company sought approval of a final tax convention that would allow exploitation of the field to proceed, it was urged to provide a large payment into a Kinshasa bank to seal an already signed deal. At the same time, people close to the company said they had been informed that Economy Minister Pierre Victor Mpoyo had begun discussions with the South African mining giant, Anglo American, for the same property that had been awarded to American Mineral Fields. Mr. Mpoyo failed to return several telephone calls seeking comment. ""We have reason to believe that Anglo American has been interfering with our contract,"" said Jean-Raymond Boulle, the largest shareholder in American Mineral Fields and the man who struck the deal with the Kabila Government. ""We have informed Anglo American of this and are reviewing our options."" Mr. Boulle would not outline those options, but people close to his company say that if its contract for the Kolwezi mine is broken, American Mineral Fields will sue, potentially tying up huge tracts of mineral-rich land in litigation for years and giving Mr. Kabila's Congo an early reputation as a risky place for investment. ""Remember, this was supposed to be a reformist Government,"" said one Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""Tying up the crown jewels of the Congolese economy for a few upfront payments is hardly the message the world was waiting to hear.""

He hawks tours to passers-by in downtown Nairobi, and these days tourists are as scarce as the endangered species he entices them to see. ""High season, we used to get five or six tourists a day,"" he said, as he scanned the busy street for foreigners and found none. ""Now you might get one. Some guys go two or three weeks without getting anything."" A month after President Daniel arap Moi won re-election to a fifth term, his Government is facing the monumental task of putting back together an economy shattered by torrential rains, political upheaval, ethnic violence, a steep drop in tourism and the suspension of foreign aid. Diplomats have taken the opportunity in recent weeks to push Mr. Moi and his allies once again to take a stronger stand against official corruption, suggesting that a resumption of foreign aid and low-interest loans to Kenya might hinge on such actions. ""Kenya's between a rock and a hard place economically,"" one diplomat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ""They really need this money. That's the only leverage we have."" Some diplomats have also used their leverage to urge the Government to do more to stop ethnic clashes in the Rift Valley, which have taken at least 100 lives in the last three weeks. Coming after months of political tension and demonstrations, the violence has scared away investors and tourists, business leaders said. Though the election on Dec. 29 was generally peaceful, since then Mr. Moi's supporters from his Kalenjin ethnic group have clashed repeatedly in the Rift Valley with Kikuyu people, who by and large supported their kinsman, Mwai Kibaki, the runner-up. The police and local authorities have been slow to respond to attacks on Kikuyu families, diplomats said. The United States has been at the forefront in pressuring Mr. Moi to put an end to the violence. Last weekend, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, President Clinton's special envoy for democracy, visited the region where the killing has been taking place, talked to victims and then met with President Moi on Monday. In the meeting, Mr. Jackson said, he told Mr. Moi that regardless of how the violence began, the United States was expecting some ""hands-on"" leadership from Mr. Moi in bringing the clashes under control. He also urged opposition leaders, who have accused Mr. Moi of orchestrating the attacks, to ""cool down provocative rhetoric."" Mr. Jackson said that Kenya's economic recovery was being crippled by the violence, and he suggested that aid from the United States and American support for loans might be jeopardized. ""There is a debate about who started it,"" Mr. Jackson said. ""There can be no debate about whose responsibility it is to end it. The Government must do it."" Mr. Jackson's visit came as Kenyan officials met with a delegation from the International Monetary Fund for the first time since the Washington-based lending institution suspended a $205 million low-interest loan to Kenya last July, citing rampant corruption among top officials. Issues in the talks included several promises Kenya made last August to persuade the fund to restore the loans, including a commitment to crack down on official graft and improve efficiency among civil servants. The fund's decision on resuming aid is seen as critical to Kenya's economic future. It is usually a guidepost for other donor countries, who together provide about $500 million in aid annually. A series of disasters have beset Kenya's economy in the last six months. Heavy rains and floods wiped out roads and bridges, twice cutting the main highway to the port of Mombasa in the last month. The rains have destroyed crops as well, crippling production of coffee, tea, corn, wheat, beans, rice and sugar. The drop-off has hurt exports and caused local prices to soar. The deluges have also caused epidemics of malaria and cholera, overburdening a creaking health care system at a time when nurses were on strike. The floods also contributed to an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever, a rare illness that has killed at least 600 people and thousands of livestock in the last three months. The political and ethnic turbulence before the December election also hurt this nation of game parks and beach resorts, where tourism is the largest earner of foreign exchange. Kenya's balance of payments was hit hard by a $280 million decline in tourism receipts because of ethnic clashes on the Indian Ocean coast in the second half of 1997. Then in January, when more clashes over land and political allegiances erupted between Kikuyu and Kalenjin ethnic groups in the Rift Valley, tourists and foreign investors continued to keep their distance. ""Foreign investors are not very comfortable with the political situation right now,"" said Lincoln Ndwiga, a Nairobi stockbroker. ""They are the big players. If they shy away, so do the local investors."" To make fiscal matters worse, strikes in December forced the Government to agree to labor settlements with teachers and other civil servants that provided for a tripling of salaries, which is likely to add millions in unexpected expenditures to the $3.1 billion annual budget. ""We definitely need an important infusion of foreign aid,"" the new Foreign Minister, Bonaya Adhi Godana, said. ""Obviously we would be glad to have had it not only restored but increased."" These problems would have been tough for any government to handle, but there is ample evidence that Kenya's has not been particularly well managed in recent years, diplomats and foreign economists say. The country's infrastructure has visibly crumbled in the last five years, despite millions of dollars in loans from the World Bank for improving roads. On average, the Government completes only about 3 percent of its capital projects each year, a fraction of the average for most countries.  Even though the World Bank has approved nearly $600 million in loans for major projects, it has been able to disburse only about $30 million because the Government has been so slow to get projects off the ground, officials said. In addition, Kenya's civil payroll is bloated with nearly 485,000 workers. The country is also paying horrendously high interest rates of more than 25 percent on its treasury bills and commercial debts. About a third of the budget goes for debt service, most of it to domestic banks. The budget deficit is expected to balloon to around 4 percent of this year's domestic output. Few resources are left over for building roads, hospitals, schools. ""This is catastrophic,"" said one diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""You can't develop a country with these kinds of numbers.""

Senator Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee's foreign operations subcommittee, said in a letter to James D. Wolfensohn, the World Bank's president, that he found news reports of possible wrongdoing uncovered by the bank's internal investigation ""shocking."" He said that it was time for an independent review of the institution's management and operations. Mr. McConnell's subcommittee was scheduled to vote next week on providing $800 million for next year to the arm of the World Bank that makes low-interest loans to the world's poorest countries. His aides said he probably would write the bill to require a full explanation of the reports of wrongdoing and the bank's failure to apprise Congress of the problem before he released the money. Mr. McConnell's letter came after newspapers reported that the bank had found evidence of kickbacks being funneled to employees in at least two cases, and was investigating other accusations as part of a broad inquiry into wrongdoing within the bank. The bank's investigations were first disclosed by the Washington Post and the Asahi Shimbun in Tokyo. When compared to the billions of dollars that the institution routinely lends to rickety, poor and sometimes corrupt governments around the world, the two cases at the center of the bank's investigations are miniscule in financial terms. In one case, World Bank officials are investigating whether two Japanese employees took $11,000 in kickbacks for steering a consulting contract to a subsidiary of a Japanese securities firm. In the only other case to have progressed beyond the initial stages of investigation, the bank filed a civil lawsuit seeking to recover tens of thousands of dollars it suspects were funneled to an employee by a technology company he hired to work on a project in Algeria. No criminal charges have been filed in either case. Analysts who follow the World Bank generally see internal corruption as a far smaller problem than the bank's attempt to wrest full control over the more than $20 billion it channels each year into construction projects, education, health and nutrition projects and other programs in scores of countries across the world. But since the institution has embarked on a high-profile effort to insure that the money it lends goes to fighting poverty and not to enriching corrupt government officials and business executives, officials at the bank were concerned that the institution be able to live up to its own standards. And with the bank's poverty-fighting effectiveness under attack in Congress and internationally among economists and development specialists, the investigations brought more criticism that the bank is not sufficiently accountable to taxpayers in the United States and other wealthy nations that help finance its operations. The Treasury Department said it had encouraged the bank to ""investigate fully and then take all appropriate actions."""4-Oct-98,"EUROPE (94%); CAMEROON (94%); DENMARK (94%); CANADA (92%); INDONESIA (92%); KENYA (92%); SWITZERLAND (92%); UNITED STATES (92%); VENEZUELA, BOLIVARIAN REPUBLIC OF (92%); FINLAND (92%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (92%);","Transparency International, a small independent organization that has been tracking for four years how the public and international businesses view corruption worldwide, has published its largest survey to date, looking at 85 countries and ranking only one completely clean: Denmark. The 1998 Corruption Perception Index, like its predecessors, is a ""survey of surveys,"" using a combination of studies by risk analysts, opinion polls and research institutions to rank countries by how they are perceived. ""No surveying approach is perfect,"" Frank Vogl, vice president of Transparency International and a former World Bank official, said of the report released last week. ""At best we get a good set of impressions."" The impressions this year are that all but 3 of the top 10 countries in the least-corrupt category are European -- Denmark, followed by Finland, Sweden, New Zealand, Iceland, Canada, Singapore, the Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland. At the other end of the scale, from the bottom up, are Cameroon, Paraguay, Honduras, Tanzania, Nigeria, Indonesia, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Russia and Vietnam and Kenya in a tie. The United States falls behind most European countries and Hong Kong, tying with Austria at 17th place. The annual index has provoked criticisms from countries that rank low on the trust scale, among them Cameroon. ""The Cameroon Government condemns strongly the arrogance of certain bodies that are in the pay of neo-colonial clusters of people at work to impede the progress of our countries instead of supporting efforts and sacrifices made by our people,"" the Government said in an official radio announcement. But Transparency International is not alone in drawing attention to corruption through its branches in all parts of the world. Last month, the United Nations Development Program and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development joined forces to publish a study of anticorruption initiatives in 25 countries that serve as models in the battle against bribery, money laundering and other impediments to economic growth. ""The international community's concern with corruption issues is not a passing phenomenon,"" top officials in the two organizations wrote in a preface to the report, ""Corruption and Integrity Improvement Initiatives in Developing Countries."" It called for ""concrete measures -- preventive as well as punitive -- that address issues of accountability, transparency and inequity at various levels of social and economic systems."" Djibril Diallo, public affairs director of the United Nations Development Program, said at a news conference that corruption is thought to siphon billions of dollars out of development each year. The O.E.C.D. has been working toward making the payment of bribes illegal in Europe, where some countries still permit tax deductions for such payments by businesses. The United States, with its 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, has been a leader in trying to stem the tide of bribery in international business. Officials at Transparency International say that they are now working on a Bribery Propensity Index to balance its Corruption Perceptions Index in the future. The 1998 corruption index can be found through the Internet at www.transparency.de."1-Jan-99,"ANGOLA (94%); NIGERIA (93%); AFRICA (92%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (79%); PORTUGAL (79%);","Civil war has ruined Angola's economy, but the chaos wrought by conflict has been a boon for politicians and generals, providing a smoke screen for rampant corruption and mismanagement in the oil and diamond industries, financial analysts and diplomats say. This southwest African nation could well become Africa's number-one oil producer over the next decade, possibly surpassing Nigeria, the current leader. Diamond deposits along Angola's many rivers and in its ancient volcanic rock, though less lucrative on a large scale than oil, are among the highest quality and most sought gemstones in the world. But as in Nigeria, which has long been one of the continent's most corrupt nations, Angola's vast and largely unaccounted-for wealth moves through a shadow economy. Oil revenue simply disappears and is believed to be taken by government officials, business sources here say. And while it is common knowledge that the UNITA rebel movement has financed itself with the diamonds in its territory, diplomats and analysts say they believe that illicit deals are made by and between rebel leaders and army generals who, when dollars are not on the table, are otherwise at war. While corruption here may not approach the level of the utterly thieving regime of Mobutu Sese Seko, the late dictator of the former Zaire, analysts and diplomats say it has become systemic. Based on anecdotal evidence, the officially enforced dearth of budgetary data and official books that just do not add up, analysts say they believe that the trend toward corruption has been set by a powerful group around President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. The group is called the Futungist faction, for the Futungo presidential compound along the Atlantic coast south of the capital. ""Everybody knows it,"" said a loyalist to dos Santos's ruling party, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). The party loyalist described corruption as the MPLA's ""life-insurance scheme,"" which took hold gradually but soon became commonplace. ""Like a virus, you could not stop it,"" he said. As he described it, independence from Portugal in 1975 turned the MPLA's guerrilla fighters into politicians who had the best of intentions but found themselves mired in bureaucratic responsibilities. With a continuing war against UNITA wearing them down at the same time, they succumbed to the temptation of simply securing their own wealth. An analyst who has attempted to decipher Angola's chaotic economic system said there is little indication in government accounts of how oil and diamond revenue flows in and out of the budget. Controls and accounting procedures for government revenue are virtually nonexistent, reducing the budget to a document of fiction, the analyst said. Half of what the government says it spends cannot be traced to a revenue source, he said, and much of what is believed to be produced in oil revenue is unaccounted for. The analyst said oil produced about $ 1.5 billion in revenue last year, with two-thirds presumed to go toward defense, leaving $ 500 million unaccounted for. ""It is not clear what really happens to this revenue,"" he said. ""There's widespread speculation that a significant chunk of it leaks out."" Leakage also is endemic in the diamond sector. No figures are available on precisely how much diamond revenue has been produced. UNITA rebels have controlled virtually all of Angola's diamond-producing territory in recent years, although the diamond-rich provinces of Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul have changed hands a few times in the past year's fighting. The economic analyst estimates that only 10 percent of diamond revenue reaches government coffers, with most of the rest going to UNITA and, to a lesser extent, to government generals. The traffic in uncertified diamonds has continued despite a U.N. embargo last June against diamond deals with UNITA. Global Witness, a Britain-based human rights group, has criticized the government for poor controls in the diamond industry and has accused international diamond conglomerate De Beers of trafficking in UNITA-mined diamonds, a charge that De Beers denies. The government rarely comments on its economic details. Officials here do, however, acknowledge that the economy is in chaos -- mired in debt and in need of reform. But when voices of criticism are raised from within the ruling party, they are silenced. Lopo do Nascimento, a former prime minister, was removed as party secretary general at a party congress last month when a reform movement loosely coalesced around him tried to open debate on the need for economic reforms, sources knowledgeable about party affairs say. Rather than entertain a reform agenda, dos Santos quashed debate on the issue and hammered at the need for unity in the face of the MPLA's chief nemesis and convenient bogey man, rebel leader Jonas Savimbi. Savimbi's UNITA -- the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola -- has been fighting the MPLA off and on since well before independence. Most government attention has been focused on checking UNITA's strength, as in the current round of fighting, which began last month with a government attempt to take UNITA's stronghold. More than two decades on a war footing has warped the economy. While defense spending is the focus of the budget, schools and clinics are not built, factories are not rehabilitated, roads -- except for a few in the capital -- are not repaired, and towns in the interior that have been destroyed by fighting stand as exhibits of the Angolan nightmare. Most of Angola's 12 million people live in utter rural poverty made all the worse by the land mines sown in the soil and the bandits who work the roads. It is notable, though mysterious, analysts say, that a private foundation established in 1997 by the president, the Fundacao Eduardo dos Santos, has been building schools with funds from an unknown source. Murky budgetary practices are one of the reasons that Angola cannot get loans from the International Monetary Fund, which has conditioned credit on more transparency and control in government accounts. Angola's external debt is about $ 10.5 billion, and the service on that debt accounts, on paper, for 20 percent of gross national product, one of the highest such percentages in the world, according to the World Bank. Angola is in such a deep financial mess that the government routinely rolls over its debt by seeking oil-guaranteed short-term loans that, in effect, mortgage future oil revenue, the financial analyst here said. The government also has no money to pay for imports, and cannot pay public servants and government contractors. But oil keeps flowing, with a host of international oil firms pumping out in the Atlantic Ocean or bidding here in the capital, Luanda, for the deep-water oil fields that industry analysts say will catapult Angola into the oil-production big leagues. Current production of 750,000 barrels per day is expected to double over the next decade. And the cost of doing oil business here also is going up, including hundreds of millions of dollars in ""signing fees"" that the government demands for oil exploration rights. Seven percent of U.S. oil imports come from Angola, and that amount is expected to double along with production. American companies, such as Chevron, are major players in the industry."7-Feb-99,UGANDA (94%); AFRICA (93%); UNITED STATES (79%);,"On a weekend morning here, with the vibrant local newspapers sticking it to the powers that be and the pundits interrupting each other on ""The Capital Gang,"" it is easy to understand why the world has grown optimistic about Uganda, a country that a quarter-century ago was competing for the title Worst Place on Earth. But read those papers, and listen to those pundits, and it's even more apparent why the optimism has become riddled with doubt: The president's brother reportedly is making off with millions, the vice president is snagged in an aid scandal, and the order of the day appears to be the pursuit of lucre by the governing elite. That's par for the course in many countries, not a few of them in Africa. But it wasn't supposed to happen in Uganda. The battered country that charming, resilient President Yoweri Museveni lifted from the legacy of dictator Idi Amin Dada had, over the intervening 13 years, built an enviable reputation as the exception to the continent's rule. The economy has grown at an impressive 6 percent annual rate and aid dollars have followed, on an assumption of good governance. Uganda's ultimate validation arrived last April in the person of President Clinton. On the longest visit to Africa by a U.S. president, the only place Clinton lingered longer was Nelson Mandela's South Africa. But in the eight months since, the glow has steadily faded. Museveni's reputation for statesmanship has been sullied by misadventure in neighboring Congo, where Ugandan troops have incurred the wrath of some other African leaders for supporting the second rebellion there in three years. They also happen to be occupying a Congolese gold mine. Meanwhile, in the capital, Kampala, the unclassifiable ""movement"" government -- some call it no-party democracy -- that Museveni conceived as an antidote to corruption has been rocked by scandal after scandal. Three ministers have resigned in disgrace so far. And in December the nation's top defense official -- Museveni's brother, Maj. Gen. Salim Saleh -- was caught trying to secretly buy a stake in Uganda Commercial Bank while it was being privatized. Compounding the embarrassment was its timing: Museveni ended up firing his kid brother the night before foreign donors convened in Kampala to vote on the aid that provides 40 percent of the country's roughly $ 2 billion annual budget. They ended up voting to maintain help at its promised level -- for now. ""If Uganda continues to kind of ignore the problem as it did last year, and do nothing, some of this money will begin to disappear,"" a senior aid official said in an interview. The official estimated that $ 200 million to $ 300 million is siphoned off through corruption each year -- as much as the World Bank alone spends in the country. ""There's a feeling that corruption is much worse than it was,"" said a diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""It's at a higher level with much higher amounts."" That feeling extends to the streets of Kampala. Here concern over the Congo war is less pronounced than concern over the chronic insurgency in northern Uganda. But speculation has grown that if the president is surrounded by corruption, ""he must be eating as well,"" as one resident put it. The accusation infuriates Museveni. For suggesting it, opposition politician K.K. Chapaa was charged with sedition; for reporting Chapaa's suggestion, an editor and reporter were jailed beside him. If the reaction smacks of African Big Man politics, however, Museveni characteristically also offered a more measured response. After complaining indignantly to the donors about ""paternalistic sermons from some friends abroad,"" he vowed ""to fight the other criminal and corrupt wings of the state"" -- but not, apparently, by using the government. ""Investigative agencies are not active enough. Maybe they are not well manned,"" Museveni told the state-owned New Vision newspaper. He thus urged Uganda's lively news media and parliament to help ferret out wrongdoing. ""We were asking: Did he want us to back off?"" said New Vision editor William Pike, referring to corruption. ""His line was, it's not an indictment of his government but a vindication of it that it can be investigated."" So it goes in Museveni's Uganda, a vibrant society with nearly all the trappings of democracy but fewer certainties. The conundrum at the heart of Museveni's government is his National Resistance Movement. The ""movement system of government"" grew out of the guerrilla army he led to power in 1986. It is founded on the idea of perpetual reform, and Ugandans acknowledge that it did wonders with the army that under dictators Amin and Milton Obote had murdered civilians by the hundreds of thousands. ""I do give Museveni this,"" said Chapaa, the opposition politician charged with sedition: ""When a soldier stops me at night, I no longer worry that I'm going to be killed."" Less popular than the reform of the army has been the outlawing of political parties. Museveni bases the ban on Uganda's ""pre-industrial"" status. In a country where 80 percent of the people are peasants sharing the same economic interest, Museveni argues that parties can make no positive contribution by consolidating economic or class interests. Their only likely effect, he says, would be division along sectarian or tribal lines. The catch is how much his movement resembles a party itself, especially since the 1996 elections that brought Uganda's parliament back to life. Though dominated by nominal movement members, the legislature features alliances that amount to caucuses, and its independence has forced the resignations of three ministers. ""Looking at it from the outside, the ingredients are there for a powerful pluralistic system,"" said Patrick Quarcoo, host of ""The Capital Gang,"" heard every Saturday morning on one of a dozen newly licensed private FM radio stations. ""Only why don't you finalize it?"" That option has been promised. Under the constitution approved before the 1996 election -- the first since Museveni came to power 10 years earlier -- Ugandans are scheduled to vote next year on whether to continue with the ""movement system"" or to allow parties. Legislation now pending before parliament would temporarily legalize ""political organizations"" to campaign on the referendum. Museveni has grown visibly exasperated, reassuring people that the referendum will in fact occur, but some uncertainty is understandable. When the Uganda Young Democrats last spring convened a series of upcountry ""seminars"" ostensibly permitted under current law, police closed down one session and clubbed participants of another, said Michael Mabikke, the group's secretary general. ""Restrictions create defiance,"" said Cecilia Ogwal, who heads an offshoot of the Uganda People's Congress, which held power before Museveni. ""The government has to create an opening to let off the steam."" The tension is the hallmark of Museveni's government: Despite his earnest appeals for building institutions, his movement remains identified, like so many African states, by one man. That may be especially true in the countryside, where the referendum will be decided. An hour north of the capital is the Luwero Triangle where Museveni's guerrillas waged the five-year war that brought him to power. It is also where the president came for a recent retreat when the corruption headlines hit their peak. ""The Capital Gang"" does not reach radios there. Political opinion remains largely private, but a half-dozen interviews gleaned the outlines of opinions, all deeply anchored in the reality that Ugandans remain among the poorest people in the world. Most of the country's storied economic growth has come in sectors such as hotels and telecommunications, although poverty has been reduced at the margins. ""We are not so poor as we were before,"" said Steven Dennis Sentongo. ""Now we are halfway okay."" Halfway may not be enough, though. In his 1996 campaign, Museveni won universal acclaim by promising free primary education; two years later, the promise is being delivered spottily. The problem, said Robert Sekitto, a father of four, is that the teacher salaries budgeted in Kampala are not reaching the teachers in Luwero. Corruption ""is a big problem,"" Sekitto said, ""even in this area."" President and Mrs. Clinton's visit last March to President Museveni, at right, was a vote of confidence in his rule. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni jailed two journalists. Ugandan army soldiers trained last year in the northern region where a chronic insurgency is continuing."15-Feb-99,UGANDA (94%); AFRICA (92%); UNITED STATES (79%);,"Karl Vick's Feb. 7 news story on Uganda was most misleading. While it raises a number of important issues on political developments and corruption, it fails to put these issues in historical context or acknowledge many of the actions the government has taken to address these problems. Mr. Vick spends considerable time giving the views of the opposition and neglects some of the most important reforms the government has implemented. The fact is that today Uganda is an open, stable, democratic country and one of the best economic performers in Africa. The article did note the vibrancy in parliament and the press, but little credit was given for this to the National Resistance Movement (NRM) leadership that has nurtured and facilitated this dramatic change. Today there is an honest debate about the role of parties in Uganda, but the fact that ""multiparty"" advocates have prominent roles in the government is not mentioned. The constitution, which was developed in an open and consultative way over a two-year period, provides for a referendum that will decide the future role of parties. President Yoweri Museveni has committed himself to live by its results. On corruption, the government has been prepared to speak openly and has acted on cases of abuse. President Museveni acknowledges that the government's performance often is weak and subject to abuse. He stresses that the capacity to deal with this issue must be strengthened, particularly with respect to the police and legal systems. While the article notes the disorder that existed when the NRM government assumed power in 1986, it fails to recognize that past practices of abuse will take time to overcome; in fact many of the most outrageous practices of the past (such as confiscation of land, use of government regulations to bankrupt competitors, attacking the role of the press) have been stopped. And although the article did refer to one of President Museveni's statements at the recent donor meeting, it failed to mention that during the meeting the government presented a detailed plan for dealing with this problem. Moreover, the government has agreed to the public release of a paper the World Bank completed on corruption in Uganda -- the first government in Africa that has been prepared to take this step. Finally, although the article noted the ministerial resignations that parliament was involved in, it didn't mention the recent firing of the inspector general of police for misuse of his office. I want to assure The Post's readers that the fight against corruption remains a high priority of the president and very much a continuation of the fight against the abuses so prominent in the pre-NRM period.

Olusegun Obasanjo, 61, whose election on Feb. 27 was welcomed by the West, appeared frank and direct as he spoke about the unsavory reputation Nigeria had acquired. But he declined to offer specifics on what he vowed would be sweeping reforms. ""I'm sure you are used to bad news from Nigeria,"" he said, adding that his country had been ""among the leading corrupt nations of the world."" He said: ""There is virtually no sector of our society that has not been wounded. We have to bind the wounds and bring conciliation and unity, give people hope and a sense of belonging and participation."" Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation, with 108 million inhabitants. Under Gen. Sani Abacha it suffered five years of ruthless dictatorship, which ended last June when he died unexpectedly. His successor, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, began reforms, allowing elections that ended in victory for Mr. Obasanjo, a retired general and former President. He is to be inaugurated on May 29. Mr. Obasanjo exuded charisma and self-confidence at a news conference yesterday, with his powerful frame cloaked in a majestic blue robe. He said his trip here, part of a world tour, was aimed at reassuring political and business leaders of his sincerity, skill and determination. He is expected in Washington today to meet with top American officials, including Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and, tentatively, President Clinton, as well as leaders of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. He arrived here from Europe, where he had offered his message of hope to the leaders and investors of France, Germany and Britain, among others. Large advertising spreads in international newsmagazines and on CNN in recent weeks have also sought to drive home the point that Nigeria, one of the world's largest exporters of oil, has embarked on a new course. Mr. Obasanjo was asked yesterday whether he would follow the South African model of healing society's wounds with the equivalent of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate the misdeeds of his predecessors and their aides. He declined to commit himself. ""When I am on the saddle, then I'll make definitive pronouncements,"" he said. He added that he did not now have the information he needed. He was slightly more forthcoming in an interview with a syndicated columnist, Jonathan Power, that appeared in the Los Angeles Times on Sunday. On corruption, he said, ""You must show that the practices you want to get rid of are punished,"" and added: ""I will more than crack the whip. I will use the whip."" Mr. Obasanjo, a Yoruba from southern Nigeria, is said to have close links to northern military leaders and was viewed during the election campaign as a bridge between the two regions. He is the only Nigerian ruler ever to have stepped down voluntarily, which he did in 1979. At the time, he set the stage for a democratic system, which was overthrown a few years later. http://www.nytimes.com"12-May-99,UNITED STATES (93%); YEMEN (92%); GHANA (92%); MALI (92%); BENIN (92%);,"TWO THINGS HELD in common by the countries of Benin, Georgia, Guyana, Malawi and Mongolia: Few Americans could find them on a map, and all are emerging democracies. They represent a class of nations that just in the past few years have embraced political reform against large odds and have received little attention for it. So it's appealing that representatives of these and other nations -- Bolivia, El Salvador, Ghana, Guatemala, Macedonia, Mali, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia and Nepal -- will next month gather in Yemen, itself an emerging democracy, to swap advice and seek some measure of recognition. The global trend toward democratization, along with some notable holdouts and recidivists, has been much remarked upon. Countries such as South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand have famously given the lie to those -- most notably in China, Singapore and Burma -- who argued that democracy was not suitable for Asia. Chile and Costa Rica have set well-noted examples for their regions. South Africa is an inspiring story of its own. Many nations emerging from the Soviet Union or its control -- such as Hungary, Poland and Lithuania -- have received at least some well-deserved attention. Now the most populous nations of Africa and Southeast Asia, Nigeria and Indonesia, are soaking up -- as they should -- much of what aid exists for transitional democracies. Relatively out-of-the-way nations such as Mali struggle in the shadow both of the success stories and of the nations gone disastrously wrong. But their struggles are in some ways all the more heroic for their relative obscurity. Moreover, there are practical reasons to help them along. Small countries can have a contagious effect on larger, more strategically significant neighbors; success can set a positive example, backsliding a demoralizing one. And the failure of small countries can have a disproportionate human and financial cost, as Rwanda and Serbia demonstrate. The June conference is sponsored by Yemen's government and the U.S. National Democratic Institute, with help from Japan, Canada and others. Hillary Clinton will attend, as will representatives of the World Bank and other financial institutions, which increasingly recognize a connection between participatory government (they still hesitate to use the d-word) and economic success. The goal of the conference goes beyond morale-boosting; representatives will trade tales on party-building, balancing political and economic reform, fighting corruption and other nitty-gritty of democracy-building. But if there's some morale-boosting, well, good."13-Aug-99,LESOTHO (94%); SWITZERLAND (92%); SOUTHERN AFRICA (88%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); GERMANY (72%);,"It's a tale involving millions of dollars allegedly funneled into Swiss bank accounts by giant international companies competing to build one of the biggest infrastructure projects under construction in the world. The companies stand accused of paying bribes to win lucrative dam-building and engineering contracts on the Highlands Water Project in the southern African kingdom of Lesotho. While bribery in Third World construction projects hardly rates as stunning news, the allegations involve big-name European multinationals, notably ABB Ltd., a Swiss-Swedish firm with about $ 31 billion in revenue last year. Moreover, the project is partly backed by the World Bank, which has recently embarked on an anti-corruption drive. And the case may prove embarrassing to the bank because its new anti-bribery guidelines won't necessarily apply. The allegations, spelled out in a charge sheet that Lesotho authorities filed July 28 against Masupha Sole, the former head of the project, contain highly specific data on payments totaling about $ 2 million that 12 companies, mostly European, allegedly provided for deposit in Sole's bank accounts in South Africa and Switzerland. A Swiss court has also found evidence indicating that the bribes were paid, according to the Swiss newspaper Sonntags Zeitung. The list of companies ""reads like a Who's Who of the dam-building industry,"" said Patrick McCully, campaigns director of the International Rivers Network, a California-based environmental activist group that opposes dams. According to the charges, ABB paid Sole about $ 40,000. Spie Batignolles of France allegedly provided about $ 120,000, Impregilo of Italy allegedly paid $ 250,000, ED Zueblin of Germany allegedly chipped in about $ 447,000, and Acres International of Canada allegedly paid about $ 188,000. Several of the companies, contacted by The Washington Post, denied paying bribes to win contracts in Lesotho. ""No payment for whatever sum at whatever time has been made by Impregilo"" to Sole, said Romano Allione, an official of the Italian company. John Fox, a spokesman for ABB, said: ""We have been working with the Lesotho authorities, supporting their investigation. About allegations, I can't comment at this point."" But some corruption experts said that if the accusations pan out, the firms should be ""debarred"" by the World Bank--that is, prohibited from bidding on projects funded by the bank, a major source of financing for dams in developing countries. A little more than two years ago, the bank cracked down on bribery after a speech by its president, James D. Wolfensohn, denouncing the ""cancer of corruption"" and its corrosive impact on poor countries. The bank, which has 181 member countries, adopted guidelines pledging to ""declare a firm ineligible, either indefinitely or for a stated period of time, to be awarded a bank-financed contract"" if the firm is found to have ""engaged in corrupt or fraudulent practices in competing for, or in executing, a bank-financed contract."" So far, the bank has debarred nine relatively small companies, but it's far from certain that the companies accused of bribery in the Lesotho case will suffer punishment by the bank even if the charges are proven. That's because, although the bank was heavily involved in formulating the project, it lent only about $ 100 million of the estimated $ 2.4 billion cost, for objectives such as engineering design and access roads--and the companies listed in the indictment may be able to avoid debarment by claiming that they won contracts for other parts of the project. Indeed, the World Bank's official statement on the Lesotho scandal suggests as much. ""We eagerly await the outcome of the court case, at which point the World Bank will decide on further steps,"" said Junaid Ahmad, the bank's deputy resident representative in South Africa. ""We will conduct an internal investigation to ensure that Bank policies and procedures have been followed on the components of the project that have been financed by the World Bank."" The bank's acting general counsel, Daoud Khairallah, said yesterday: ""We cannot eradicate corruption in all situations where we have no control. . . . If any of our funds have been tampered with, yes, we can debar. But not if it's something that we didn't have any control over."" Jeremy Pope, executive director of Transparency International, an organization dedicating to fighting corruption, voiced incredulity that the companies might get off the hook. ""It's a project the World Bank was involved in, and logic says--if you're bribing, you're bribing; and if you're unfit to be bidding for business, you're unfit."" In any event, he said, ""when these companies go bidding for public sector business, their competitors will use this and say, 'If you do a deal with that lot, everyone will think you've been bribed.' "" The bank's anti-corruption efforts are part of a broader drive against bribery in the industrialized world. After considerable agitation by the United States, which made it a crime in 1977 for U.S. firms to bribe foreign officials, the 29 wealthy countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ratified a convention in December 1997 pledging to criminalize foreign bribery. But less than half of the nations have passed the necessary laws, and in any case the alleged bribery of Sole took place before the convention was adopted. The Lesotho project is located in a country of about 2 million, entirely surrounded by South Africa, that is rated as one of the world's poorest, with almost no natural resources other than water. The project, which includes a dam more than 600 feet high, provides water to an industrial region of South Africa and provides employment to Lesotho, most of whose workers must find jobs in South Africa. But the International Rivers Network charges that the project has disrupted communities and led to the establishment of squatters' camps, replete with prostitution and AIDS, in once-remote mountain communities. The group also asserts that massive bribery is predictable in such projects--and notes that some of the companies named in the Lesotho indictment have figured in other corruption scandals involving dams. The follwing have been accused of paying bribes to win contracts for a major project in Lesotho:  Project: Highlands Water Venture Country: Int'l consortium Alleged bribe amt. in U.S. dollars: $ 733,404  Project: ED Zueblin Country: Germany Alleged bribe amt. in U.S. dollars: 447,425  Project: Impregilo Country: Italy Alleged bribe amt. in U.S. dollars: 250,000  Project: Acres International Country: Canada Alleged bribe amt. in U.S. dollars: 188,229  Project: Spie Batignolles Country: France Alleged bribe amt. in U.S. dollars: 120,192  Project: Dumez International Country: France Alleged bribe amt. in U.S. dollars: 82,973  Project: LHPC Chantiers Country: Int'l consortium Alleged bribe amt. in U.S. dollars: 64,332  Project: LHPC Country: Int'l consortium Alleged bribe amt. in U.S. dollars: 57,651  Project: ABB Country: Sweden, Switzerland Alleged bribe amt. in U.S. dollars: 40,681  Project: Sogreah Country: France Alleged bribe amt. in U.S. dollars: 13,669  Project: Lahmeyer Consulting Engineers Country: Germany Alleged bribe amt. in U.S. dollars: 8,732  Project: Diwi Consulting Country: Germany Alleged bribe amt. in U.S. dollars: 2,456  NOTE: Figures converted at recent exchange rates.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Not only did the World Bank finance the design of the project; it also is responsible for setting up and coordinating the financing program. According to a confidential World Bank project document, in 1991 the bank agreed to participate in a trust for offshore lenders ""to provide some comfort for lenders who might otherwise be reluctant to assist in the financing."" This type of comfort was needed because of the international sanctions then in place against the apartheid regime in South Africa. According to the same document, the World Bank loan for the project went only nominally to Lesotho, a country far too poor to qualify for large loans, while the real borrower was South Africa's apartheid regime. It is unacceptable for the World Bank to claim that it is a passive bystander in the unfolding corruption investigation. Should the corruption allegation be substantiated, the World Bank must debar the companies involved in the bribery from future World Bank-financed activities. It also should launch an investigation into its own role in this controversial project. Besides serious allegations of corruption, the project, which includes the highest dam in Africa, has caused the vulnerable Highlands population to lose fields, grazing lands and access to fresh water sources. Despite promises, their livelihoods have not been reestablished, and poor people have been pushed closer to the edge in their struggle for survival. Problems of erosion and the downstream effects of massive water diversion will disrupt ecosystems and people's livelihoods. In Lesotho, as in many places, corruption, environmental degradation and increasing poverty have a tendency to go together.

We agree that such allegations must be taken seriously. For this reason, we are pleased that the governments of Lesotho and South Africa have investigated the matter promptly and brought the case to court. We also agree -- indeed, we are proud -- that the World Bank played a leading role in making this important project happen, even if our financial contribution was less than 5 percent of total costs. Our commitment to preventing corruption extends well beyond our financial involvement in a project. Corruption hurts the poor most of all -- whether it involves official aid, private investment or the use of a developing country's own taxpayers' money. Therefore, we are determined to help African countries fight corruption in all its forms. The Lesotho project was in the making for more than 20 years and is important for southern Africa as a whole, not just Lesotho. In addition to meeting South Africa's water needs, the project is helping poor communities in Lesotho through a social fund set up with revenues from the project. World Bank involvement helped ensure that the project was designed to the highest economic, social and environmental standards. Large development projects can carry special risks, but they can be designed successfully. Most non-governmental organizations in Lesotho and South Africa support the project and appreciate the openness and care with which it was prepared. Dealing seriously with corruption is consistent with that openness and with the World Bank's interest in seeing such projects serve the poor. Washington The writers are vice presidents for the Africa region at the World Bank."25-Sep-99,LESOTHO (94%); AFRICA (93%);,"In their Sept. 12 letter regarding corruption allegations in the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP), Callisto E. Madavo and Jean-Louis Sarbib of the World Bank claim they are ""determined to help African countries fight corruption."" We, as members of nongovernmental organizations in Lesotho, appreciate this sentiment. We are troubled, however, by their failure to promise World Bank sanctions against the 12 multinational corporations accused of bribing the former chief executive of the LHWP. What better way is there to ""fight corruption"" than to punish the big companies that tempt us ""poor"" Africans with big bribes? Mr. Madavo and Mr. Sarbib also claim that the project is ""helping poor communities in Lesotho through a social fund"" set up with LHWP revenues. Unfortunately, this is not our perception here on the ground. The fund has been and continues to be a tool of opportunistic politicians. Although the committee designated to select projects to be supported by the social fund has not yet met, money from the fund has been used to support ill-conceived projects built by workers hired according to political party affiliation. In Lesotho we see the same stretch of road repaired, torn up the next week, repaired again the following week and then torn up once more at the end of the month. We see workers increase the height of unused dams and then cut spillways in them that effectively reduce their carrying capacities to their original levels. These projects are supported by the LHWP's social fund. Is this how large development projects ""serve the poor""? We do support the LHWP, but we are beginning to question the openness and care with which it was prepared. Punishing the corrupt multinationals involved with the LHWP and closely monitoring the implementation of the project's social fund would reassure us of the World Bank's concern. If Mr. Madavo and Mr. Sarbib want to serve the ""poor,"" they can help us to challenge the existing power and economic relations that keep us ""poor.""

The organization, based in Berlin, which released both reports, the Corruption Perceptions Index and the Bribe Payers Index, in Washington, found that once again officials in northern European countries were perceived to have the cleanest hands, while the highest levels of bribe-taking officials appeared to be in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the former Soviet bloc. When it came to countries whose companies pay bribes abroad, China was perceived to be the worst offender, followed by South Korea, Taiwan, Italy and Malaysia. No country's corporations were regarded as innocent of bribe paying. But the Europeans, Australia and Canada came out best. The idea that corruption is a third world phenomenon raises tempers in developing countries every year when the Corruption Perceptions Index is published. The survey this year is the fifth and largest. ""There was a sense in some countries that we were a group from the richer north that was singling out the poor countries"" said Frank Vogl, a former World Bank official and now vice chairman of Transparency International, which he helped found in 1993. ""People said that basically there is a conspiracy of corruption between the takers of bribes and the givers of bribes, and it should be recognized. We thought we would create a Bribe Payers Index."" Both indices plot perceptions, not concrete evidence, though in different ways. The Corruption Perception Index is a ""poll of polls,"" based on data from 17 surveys from 10 independent institutions that analyze business conditions around the world. The 1999 index includes 99 countries, up from 85 last year. The Bribe Payers Index was based on a survey conducted for Transparency International by Gallup International in 14 leading emerging-market countries. They were Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Morocco, Nigeria, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Korea, South Africa and Thailand.  Gallup International, which is based in London, interviewed 770 senior executives in those nations. Mr. Vogl said in an interview on Friday in New York that the two indices were ""two sides of the same coin."" He said it was fashionable now to be against corruption and to demand that developing countries clean house before aid was granted. ""But there is hypocrisy,"" he added. ""Many major industrial countries do quite well on the C.P.I. Yet they are not discouraging their own firms from corrupting foreign governments."" Although the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of industrial countries, has adopted a convention making bribery of foreign officials a criminal offense, member nations have not stopped the practice, Mr. Vogl said. No country scored a perfect 10 on the Bribe Payers scale, where a low score indicates corrupt practices. The best rating was Sweden's at 8.3, followed by 8.1 for Australia and Canada. The United States, which has had a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act on the books for 22 years, scored 6.2. At the bottom, China registered 3.1. On the Corruption Perceptions Index, the ranking by the perceived honesty of officials, there was one perfect score. Denmark scored 10. The United States had 7.5, behind the northern Europeans, Singapore and Hong Kong. Transparency International, founded six years ago by a small group of people who had seen development aid fail to achieve its goals as corruption flourished, has 77 national chapters. Mr. Vogl said he was impressed less by that growth than by the explosion of public demand that governments and businesses stop corrupting one another. Concerns about corruption are finally becoming part of policy making, he said, pointing to the questions that Washington is now confronting about dealing with Russia. ""Five years ago, we couldn't get into the World Bank,"" Mr. Vogl said. ""We were told that this was politics."" Now, he added, there is a ""vast civil society movement"" that is asking questions in many capitals about why health care or other services receive no money while officials buy airplanes. http://www.nytimes.com"31-Oct-99,"KENYA (94%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (94%); UZBEKISTAN (93%); INDONESIA (93%); CAMEROON (93%); NIGERIA (93%); AZERBAIJAN (92%); GERMANY (92%);","LIKE music CD's, box office receipts and the world's richest people, corruption has its own top 10 list. For the last five years Transparency International, a nonprofit group based in Berlin that specializes in tracking global thievery, has released the annual Corruption Perceptions Index, ranking the world's most corrupt countries. Last week the group declared Cameroon, Nigeria, Indonesia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Honduras, Tanzania, Yugoslavia, Paraguay and Kenya as the world's most graft-ridden countries, populated by public officials who are much quicker to take bribes than their counterparts in countries like Denmark, New Zealand and Sweden. But while Transparency's work has been lauded by economists and other analysts for helping to make corruption a centerpiece of debates about economic development and public policy, critics say the group's hit list unfairly tars countries that may be no more corrupt than those ranked much lower on the list. Indeed, the critics say the media is so quick to latch on to top 10 lists that agencies like Transparency International have an obvious incentive to present their information that way to score public relations coups. All the attention generated by the Corruption Perceptions Index, and criticism that it tended to highlight poor countries without noting the role that industrialized countries play in fomenting corruption abroad, led Transparency to introduce yet another ranking last week -- the Bribe Payers Index. ""One of the worries people have had is that the ranking is very misleading,"" Rafael di Tella, an economics professor at Harvard Business School and one of Transparency's outside advisors, said of the Corruption Perceptions Index. ""Transparency International has become a slave to the success of the index and it doesn't want to address the problem."" The problem, as Mr. di Tella and others see it, is that the data used to analyze corruption -- surveys, for example, of business executives' perceptions -- are so fuzzy that huge margins of error exist when assigning a numerical yardstick to graft. Johann Graf Lambsdorff, a German statistician responsible for orchestrating Transparency's numbers into a coherent whole, says critics of the list unfairly imply that his methodology is faulty when, in fact, the only issue is how the results of Transparency's surveys are presented. Even so, Mr. Lambsdorff says he is comfortable with his group's list. ""A ranking is easier to convey information to a large public, like a football ranking,"" said Mr. Lambsdorff, a professor at Gottingen University. ""We can clearly say that Denmark is cleaner than Germany and Germany is cleaner than Botswana. But in between there may be some problems -- saying that Kenya is cleaner than Tanzania, for example."" But that is precisely the problem, say critics, pointing to Bolivia's Presidential election in 1997 as an example of the list's far-reaching influence. The former dictator Hugo Banzer won the Presidency that year on an anti-corruption platform bolstered by the release of Transparency's rankings shortly before the election -- rankings showing that corruption in Bolivia was worse than in many of its neighbors. Mr. Lambsdorff says Transparency cannot avoid having such an impact because elections are occurring in many countries when their rankings are released. ""We keep on stressing that these are perceptions, not hard facts,"" said Frank Vogl, Transparency International's vice-chairman and co-founder. ""You always have this problem of how to present the data."" Nonetheless, the list has stirred dissent within the group's own membership. ""Transparency's index was good when there were no other numbers available but we need to go further now,"" said Luis Moreno Ocampo, a prominent anti-corruption crusader in Argentina who is a member of Transparency's advisory council. ""The issue is not which country is worse than another, the issue is how to solve the problem. We need to track where the money is going and who is stealing it."" Mr. Moreno has been working with the World Bank to come up with new methods of measuring and presenting data on corruption. Daniel Kaufmann, a senior manager with the World Bank, says grouping countries in broad categories -- rather than ranking them -- is the fairest way to shine a spotlight on corruption. ""The idea that Transparency International had is brilliant and now we all want to be more rigorous and circumspect when we analyze corruption,"" he said.  http://www.nytimes.com"25-Dec-99,COTE D'IVOIRE (96%); AFRICA (95%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%); FRANCE (90%); KENYA (79%); UNITED STATES (79%);,"Army troops in the West African country of Ivory Coast seized control of the capital, Abidjan, today and proclaimed a military government, an uprising unprecedented in a country long considered one of Africa's most stable. Soldiers began seizing government installations Thursday in what they said was a mutiny by an Abidjan-based unit over unpaid wages. Today, the former army chief of staff, Gen. Robert Guei, announced on state television that President Henri Konan Bedie was no longer in power. But Bedie said later in a radio interview that he retained power and was meeting with mutinous troops. Bedie appealed for popular resistance to the coup, but poor people in Abidjan's vast slums cheered his reported overthrow, said residents. Bedie's Democratic Party of Ivory Coast--the only party that has ruled there in nearly 40 years of independence--has lost support in the past decade over official corruption and rising demands for real democracy. Still, as some senior military officers and foreign diplomats reportedly implored Guei to halt the coup, independent observers found reason to hope that the crisis might be resolved peacefully. Ivory Coast--known officially by its French name, Cote d'Ivoire--has a large, educated middle class and civil society unlikely to support military rule. The strongest reason for optimism lay in how strongly the flavor of events once so common to transfers of power in Africa--dueling broadcasts, mutinous soldiers firing automatic weapons into the air and a man in uniform declaring the constitution null and void--now seemed out of place. Since the end of the Cold War, coups have become less frequent in Africa and, indeed, have never occurred in Ivory Coast. Self-appointed rulers who once could count on the United States or the Soviet Union to prop them up must answer to an array of Western donors, starting with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. And their primary condition for foreign aid is at least the appearance of democracy. ""That's the new atmosphere,"" said Herman J. Cohen, a former assistant secretary of state for Africa. ""This general on the television doesn't seem to realize that."" Ivory Coast, long ruled by the French troops and bureaucrats who created it, has remained one of France's most loyal former colonies in Africa. Its founder, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, ruled the country tightly for 33 years, permitting opposing political parties only when he could no longer prevent them without heavy bloodshed. Bedie, a bland machine politician in the ruling party, took power when Houphouet-Boigny died in 1993. Bedie won a disputed election and rode out protests and riots in 1995 after disqualifying his chief opponent. Soon after, Bedie dismissed Guei as army chief; officials alleged that Guei had been plotting a coup. On Thursday, soldiers drove into the state television station and fired into the air when some employees resisted orders to leave. Some of the employees fled to the U.S. Embassy's cultural center around the corner, and told Washington Post researcher Solomon Ababio that the troops were demanding back pay for their unit's service in a U.N. peacekeeping mission in the Central African Republic. In numerous parts of Abidjan, soldiers looted shops and were joined by impoverished civilians, residents said. No deaths were reported. Guei appeared on state television today, saying he had taken power at the troops' request. ""From this instant, President Henri Konan Bedie is no longer the president of the republic,"" he said, and proclaimed the dissolution of parliament and other government institutions. A Military Committee of Public Salvation announced a dusk-to-dawn curfew and called on soldiers to cease looting. From a hiding place in the city's diplomatic neighborhood, Bedie responded in an interview on Radio France Internationale. He called on Ivorians to ""resist and oppose this grotesque and retrograde military coup by all means possible,"" and vowed to remain at his post. He pledged to resolve the pay demands of the soldiers through ""dialogue."" An American reached by telephone in Abidjan described the mutineering soldiers as raucous, but said residents were calm. ""There are [soldiers] roaring through the streets looking pretty ugly, with cars that have obviously been stolen,"" the resident said. ""All the danger is potential danger, but the potential danger is there."" The Christmas Eve crisis followed months of mounting opposition to Bedie. Like virtually all black African states created as European-ruled colonies, Ivory Coast is an artificial mix of ethnic groups. While Houphouet-Boigny ran an authoritarian government, he assiduously dampened ethnic tensions, partly by distributing wealth from the cocoa farms that are the pillar of the economy. But cocoa prices have fallen and the economy has struggled to keep up with a flood of immigration from Burkina Faso, Mali, Liberia, Ghana and other neighbors. In 1995, Bedie--an ethnic Baoule from the country's center--alienated many Muslim northerners by disqualifying northerner Alassane Ouattara from the presidential race, and tensions over that issue have revived as Bedie faces reelection next fall. ""For a place where things are good, things are bad at the moment in Ivory Coast,"" said I. William Zartman, director of African Studies at the Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies. He said the coup could yet be reversed or result in a more even-handed election than Bedie was prepared to allow.

Robert Guei, said today that he was suspending the country's staggering foreign-debt payments. General Guei's announcement apparently reversed his pledge last week to honor international commitments inherited from the elected government that he ousted in a coup on Christmas Eve. ""We have temporarily suspended payments of foreign commitments,"" General Guei said in a statement, explaining that coffers were empty. ""Only after a thousand gymnastic moves were we even able to pay salaries."" ""As you can imagine, the pillage was immense and systematic,"" General Guei said in the statement. He said his administration had begun auditing state accounts to learn who is responsible for missing funds. He did not say whether Ivory Coast intended to resume debt payments later on to the World Bank, European Union, International Monetary Fund and other lenders. On Tuesday, General Guei named himself president and defense minister in an interim coalition government. The new cabinet was sworn in today. Ivory Coast, long one of Africa's most stable and prosperous countries, built up a huge debt -- estimated at $19.7 billion in 1996 -- during nearly four decades under the party of the ousted president, Henri Konan Bedie. The junta's move to halt debt payments threatens to aggravate the financial crisis. Last year, the monetary fund and the European Union slashed aid to the country after corruption allegations against the Bedie government. Since the coup, the United States and Canada have also cut aid to the West African country. France, the former colonial ruler, is scaling back its support. And the European Union's representative, Catherine Travin, said today that European officials were scheduled to hold talks with the junta that could lead to further aid cuts. The coup came during an economic decline linked to falling prices for Ivory Coast's main exports, coffee and cocoa. Tensions increased sharply during the final months of Mr. Bedie's government, which was widely accused of corruption and stirring ethnic enmities.  http://www.nytimes.com"13-Mar-00,LATIN AMERICA (92%); ASIA (92%); INDIA (79%); BRAZIL (79%); MEXICO (79%); EUROPE (79%); AFRICA (79%); MIDDLE EAST (79%); BANGLADESH (78%); THAILAND,"During the past few days a good deal of coverage has been focused on the Meltzer Commission Report on the International Financial Institutions, and what it might mean for the World Bank. Let me take this opportunity to lay out some real concerns that we at the bank have, and also to set the record straight. We are, of course, pleased that the issue of poverty reduction should be headline news. We share the commission's concern that more must be done by all the players in the fight against poverty, and we applaud all who broach this difficult subject. We also welcome the commission's call for debt relief, and we hope that funding support from Congress will follow it. This is crucial. We nevertheless believe that a number of the commission's proposals are based on a fundamental misreading of the development challenges we face today. Poor people in developing countries will be the losers if these proposals are implemented. If the World Bank were to withdraw entirely from Asia and from Latin America; if it were to stop lending to countries with a per capita income above $ 4,000 a year, it would cut out the marginalized, the poorest, the excluded who live in these countries. Private-sector investors will not fund the improvements in health, education and other essential public services that people need to pull themselves out of poverty. Moreover, if the World Bank were to stop lending for anti-corruption work, good governance, regulatory reform and institution building, it would cease to create the kind of enabling environment that can attract private funds to countries and areas that currently receive little. No other organization is doing this work on a global scale. A critical strength of the World Bank is its ability to learn from developing countries in all regions of the world and to reflect those lessons in its policy advice and operations and in its global research programs. Under the commission's proposal to devolve country programs to regional development banks, our clients would be limited to countries in Africa, the Middle East, Europe and the former Soviet Union. This would undermine the World Bank's global character at the very time that the demands of globalization are pointing in the opposite direction. The loss of the bank's cross-regional perspective and the synergies it generates would hurt everyone--especially the poor of the developing world. But the burden would fall heaviest on the 2.2 billion people living on less than $ 2 per day in Asia and Latin America, since the bank would no longer be involved in country programs there. We would need to withdraw our support for maternal health in Bangladesh, AIDS programs in India, legal reform in Thailand, social security reform in Brazil, financial sector reform in Mexico and so on. Reflecting other commission recommendations, we also would need to withdraw from important country programs in Europe, such as Poland, where we have supported the creation of market-friendly legal and regulatory frameworks and financial sector and health care reforms. Nor do the commission's recommendations seem to be supported by sound analysis and careful use of statistics. The report states that 70 percent of the World Bank's non-concessional lending goes to 11 countries that have substantial access to capital markets, but it ignores the fact that these countries are home to more than 60 percent of the poor people in the developing world. The report's authors also fault the bank for neglecting its own insight that aid can be effective only in countries with good policies. But in 1997-99, the best-performing countries annually received almost five times more International Development Association resources per capita than poor performers. We have changed, and we are changing. By the late 1990s, the financial sector and the social sectors--such as education and health--absorbed about a quarter each of total annual World Bank lending, up from around 5 percent each during the early 1980s. None of this is reflected in the commission's report. Nor is the fact that our operational performance has improved markedly over the past few years. Instead, the report bases much of its argument on a distorted use of statistics on bank effectiveness. We welcome debate. But we need to test the commission's recommendations against the challenges that we face on the ground every day. Unfortunately, against this measure I believe that many of them significantly miss the mark.

The latest charge comes from Congress's Meltzer Commission [""Limiting the Scope of the World Bank,"" op-ed, March 13]. Yet the bank president's response is to repeat in various ways a single mantra: If the World Bank's powers are restricted or limited in any way, the poor of the world will suffer. But James Wolfensohn evades the real question: Does the bank really help the poor? There is ample evidence that it does not. From 1980 to 1997, per-capita income for sub-Saharan Africa, which is largely under World Bank tutelage, fell by 21.6 percent. The bank's structural adjustment policies force countries to reduce services to the poor in order to service foreign debt owed to the bank as well as to private corporations. Forty percent of the World Bank Group's lending is for extraction industries--oil, gas and mining--that are accompanied by environmental destruction, corruption, forced relocation of the poor and indigenous and the enrichment of multinational corporations.

Yet the World Bank is poised to lend $300 million to them and to the Exxon Mobil Corporation and the Chevron Corporation to develop oil fields in Chad and build a pipeline to Cameroon.

I have to pay mine. That's a critical question hanging over the ""dump the debt"" rally scheduled to take place on the Mall this afternoon, when demonstrators will urge international lenders to write off the hundreds of billions of dollars owed to them by the world's poorest nations. Without declaring bankruptcy and giving up control of our own finances, most of us cannot imagine being excused from paying back money we had borrowed--and if we did, we certainly wouldn't expect the bank to lend to us again. Even World Bank President James Wolfensohn--who supports a certain amount of debt relief himself--thinks it would be ""whimsical"" to cancel every nation's debt. ""If you have a society based on debt forgiveness,"" Wolfensohn said in February, ""who's going to invest in debt anymore? So you really screw up the market."" In more than one Third World embassy here in Washington, the same fear has been expressed. Of course these diplomats want debt relief. But their countries are poor, many of them devastated by natural disasters or civil wars, and they will surely need to borrow more money to survive and develop. What bank would throw good money after bad? Let's consider that question. In particular, let's consider Africa, the continent where 33 of the 41 Heavily Indebted Poor Countries--the HIPC nations, so defined by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund--can be found, and therefore the continent on which much of the debt-relief campaign is focused. Having spent much of the last 20 years reporting and writing from Africa, I'll begin with a bit of history.  The bottom began falling out of African economies in the early 1970s. Most nations had been independent for little more than a decade, and either didn't understand--or didn't want to--that the boom in prices for their mineral and agricultural exports was not permanent. Inexperienced or corrupt leaders borrowed, spent and then borrowed some more, urged on by Western commercial lenders eager to start earning interest on the petrodollars that had been deposited in their banks by newly flush OPEC moguls. This symbiosis of greedy governments and overeager lenders meant that billions of dollars flowed into African nations for economic expansion, which often took the form of huge industrialization projects and ostentatious, politically visible structures in capital cities. In addition, about 20 percent of the funds lent during these Cold War years went to arms purchases. Debt was increasing but new governments did not feel it. The lenders were getting their initial paybacks. Good money was borrowed and thrown after bad whenever needed. Everyone was making out like bandits; everyone, that is, except poor African citizens, growing in numbers and generally not sharing the wealth of their rulers. Then came the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979, which triggered worldwide inflation and recession. Prices for African commodities collapsed; prices for basic necessities like fuel and fertilizer skyrocketed. By the early 1980s, Africa was reeling just as repayment on loans taken out a few years earlier came due. Most of Africa's debt at that time was owed to private banks. When these institutions realized African nations could not cover their debts, they lobbied multilateral agencies such as the IMF to lend African countries the money to pay off the debts. That's how Citibank got out of bad loans to the country then called Zaire (and it helped that Mobutu Sese Seko's Zaire was a Cold War ally of the United States). Citibank got bailed out, but Zaire (now Congo) didn't--it just owed money to a different lender. Trapped in this ruinous cycle of debt servitude and underdevelopment, Africa and its people have paid a heavy price. Ironically, within this historical experience lie truths that argue for the possible success of debt relief. To put the argument briefly, things are changing in Africa, and some things already have changed significantly. These days, both banks and wealthy governments are much more cautious about their money. The rules for lending are tougher: The U.S. government can no longer simply sign off on a loan made for political reasons without paying attention to how the money will be used. Loans are made more responsibly than in the aggressive Cold War years. And the lenders have a practical goal: Africa, like China, does not have to be a drag on the world economy if it can use its natural resources and labor force in productive work. And developed economies would mean future markets for the West in Africa. Meanwhile, the governments seeking debt relief today are dramatically different than those that fell into ruin. Military rule and ""Big Man"" government have gone out of fashion in Africa; Mobutu and his fellow ""kleptocrats"" are largely gone. Africa's new governments, I believe, are smarter and less corrupt. I once asked Issaias Afwerki, president of Eritrea--a country that didn't exist as a separate entity a decade ago--what it had meant to his people to fight their 30-year war for independence from Ethiopia. ""If there was any good in a conflict of such length,"" Afwerki responded, ""it was that it gave you a chance to watch and learn from everybody's mistakes and to plan how to avoid them."" Apparently, he is avoiding at least some of them: The World Bank Web site advises that even though Eritrea has a per capita GNP less than half the African average, ""the economic outlook is promising because of sound management and relatively diversified production."" While democracy is far from perfected on the continent, I can tick off a list of leaders from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic who are seriously engaged in developing civil societies that respond to citizen concerns and needs. Certainly there are still regions of terrible armed conflict--Angola comes immediately to mind--but conflict need not define what Africa is today. As a practical matter, the continent is a better place to lend money than it was a generation ago. The truth of that statement is what underlies the African Growth and Opportunities Act, a House bill with broad bipartisan support that aims to promote development by easing trade barriers. If you're cynical, you'll say governments there will squander any new loans all over again. The Africa I see suggests the opposite. In fact, there already is a consensus among commercial banks, multilateral lending institutions and governments that there has to be debt relief. This is a pragmatic, not a charitable, conclusion. Every banker in the world knows that it has become impossible for the HIPCs to pay their staggering debts. African countries alone owe $ 227 billion; Mozambique's tab is $ 1.4 million a week.  To pay that off, every bit of work and every cent of earnings would have to go toward debt payments. That would be politically unsustainable--and if Mozambique's government collapses, nobody's going to get paid anything. That's why some lenders have already begun--slowly--to reduce the debt, through limited cancellation, some restructuring and some rescheduling. In fact, agreement was reached at an international summit in Cologne, Germany, last June to cancel about $ 111 billion of the $ 354 billion owed by poor nations. ""It's not like the [World] Bank, the [IMF] fund, and the United States are waiting for their money,"" Lisa Wright, a Church World Services official who tracks the debt issue closely, told me recently. In other words, the money has already been lost. So forgiving the debt usually means little more than changing an entry in a ledger. And how will that ledger entry be accounted for? Well, the IMF can make up some of its losses by selling off part of its 103-million-ounce gold reserves. The United States, Britain and other wealthy nations are kicking in some money to a new multilateral debt relief trust fund. (The European Union promises to put up $ 700 million when the United States hands over the $ 600 million it promised last year.) This is essentially foreign aid by another name; some brave bureaucrats are even willing to float the idea that instead of loans the poorest HIPCs should get direct grants. None of these partial measures, of course, satisfies critics like those in Jubilee 2000, the debt-relief group that has organized today's rally. They say that the ""structural adjustments"" proposed under the HIPC program would force debtor nations to make such strict economic reforms that they would have to abandon vital social programs. They have three broad but closely related objections to the HIPC program: It's too little too late; the burden of debt servicing is still too heavy; and it is designed to serve the needs of creditors rather than the poor. But the World Bank and the IMF emphatically reject full cancellation of debt as unrealistic. Cancellation would raise false expectations of assistance that could not be met because foreign aid money is so limited, they argue. Besides, they also say, sounding very much like a relief worker at the African grass roots, debt is only part of a larger social problem. The IMF and the World Bank also claim to have learned from past mistakes--and they want to make sure their largess is responsibly used. In the end, the question is not whether debt should be forgiven; it's how fast and to what extent. My experience suggests that the faster and broader the debt relief, the better for Africa--and the world.

The delay is an embarrassing new complication for a global debt-relief program that Congress is skeptical about funding. Uganda, an early participant in the program, has won praise for using the savings from canceled debt payments to improve primary education. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank had hoped to announce approval of an expanded package for Uganda at a meeting of their governing committees this week here. But last week officials delayed implementing the plan, some of them appalled at the idea of forgiving more loans just when a luxury jet was ordered. Sources said the reported cost of the plane, about $ 35 million, is about what Uganda would save annually in debt-service payments under an expanded aid plan that now has been delayed. Thousands of demonstrators were expected to turn out today to protest the World Bank and IMF, which they say finance a world order based on exploitation. The institutions have cited the debt-relief program as proof that they care about countries left behind by the global economy and are taking tough decisions to help them. The program grows from a decision last year by industrial nations to forgive $ 28 billion in debt owed to the World Bank and other ""multilateral"" lenders. More than 30 countries could potentially qualify. The core requirement is that money saved on debt payments must go to schools, public health programs and other desperately needed services. Participating countries must work out detailed plans with lenders--the idea is to assure that corruption and local political priorities that often led to the squandering of the original loans don't lead to the misuse of money saved on debt service. With Congress delaying a White House request for funding of the U.S. share of the global program, proponents were worried that the delay would give new ammunition to the program's critics. Some were urging Uganda to reverse itself. ""We don't think that the plane is pro-poor . . . and we think the government of Uganda should reconsider its priorities as soon as possible,"" said Seth Amgott, a spokesman for Oxfam International, a relief agency that has promoted the debt-relief program. An IMF director representing Uganda in the organization said he believed the delay would be short. Questions were posed about the jet, but not ""in a challenging way,"" Cyrus Rustomjee said. ""We don't recognize this as being any extraordinary expenditure."" The plane's purchase had been discussed in Uganda's parliament. It would be used by President Yoweri Museveni, who has been in office since seizing power in 1986. Phone calls placed yesterday to Uganda's embassy were not answered."23-May-00,AFRICA (94%); UNITED STATES (93%); CAMEROON (92%); CHAD (92%); CENTRAL AFRICA (73%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (55%);,"The World Bank will delay a vote on financing a $3.5 billion oil pipeline project in Africa led by the Exxon Mobil Corporation and the Chevron Corporation to give its board more time to consider the contested plan, a bank spokesman said. The vote, initially scheduled for tomorrow, will be held off until June 6 because ""some governments wanted more time,"" Robert Calderisi, the spokesman, said. Mr. Calderisi declined to say which nations sought the delay, although human rights groups and environmentalists have pressed the United States and European Union to oppose the project, which has already been delayed two years. They say that corruption in Chad and Cameroon will siphon off pipeline revenue meant to ease poverty in the region and that pollution controls are inadequate. The United States, the World Bank's largest shareholder, is still weighing how to vote on the bank's contribution, which would include about $200 million in direct loans and several hundred million dollars more to be syndicated through commercial banks, an official said. The delays have angered African officials, who said the central African nations would benefit from the pipeline. The project is expected to yield one billion barrels of oil over 30 years. http://www.nytimes.com"26-May-00,CAMEROON (93%); NIGERIA (79%);,"The Post is naive to think that by splitting control of an oil project in Chad and Cameroon between multinational oil corporations and the government, good will come to the two countries [editorial, May 22]. It is an understatement to say that Chad has ""weak democratic institutions"": Nonviolent protesters against the oil project have been gunned down by the army, and a parliamentarian who expressed opposition to the project was thrown in jail and now lives in exile. According to Transparency International, Cameroon has the most corrupt government in the world. If the project is left up to the governments, terrible things will happen. But would multinational corporations be any better? Shell, Elf and Agip caused the strife in Nigeria. This project will lead to the destruction of rain forests, will cause the death of indigenous cultures and will lead to massive pollution and human rights abuses. Only the oil consortium and the government will benefit, no matter how the project is organized, at the expense of people and the environment.

The report, prepared jointly with the United Nations and African development institutions, said Ghana, Mozambique and Uganda were among a handful of African nations that have piloted a way out of extreme poverty. But it says that with AIDS, malaria and civil strife rising, conditions in the region as a whole are worsening. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the two leading international lending agencies, have come under intense scrutiny over their multibillion-dollar African aid programs. Protesters who ran noisy demonstrations in Washington at the spring meetings of the bank and the fund said the two institutions had made Africa poorer through failed policies, a position that the bank's analysis partly vindicates. The 280-page report acknowledges that the heavy flow of aid in recent decades did relatively little to ignite sustained economic growth, but the study adds that the World Bank has reinvented how it manages aid. ""The temptation is to retreat into pessimism,"" the bank's vice president for Africa, Callisto E. Madavo, said. ""But I think if you look at what we have been doing recently, you can see that we're really on the right track."" Sub-Saharan Africa is the only major region that moved backward in the later decades of 20th century, says the report, which catalogs the many woes while prescribing some remedies. In the early 1960's, African nations were widely considered more advanced than East Asian nations. But between that time and the end of the 90's, Africa retreated in real economic terms, while East Asia's economic output increased fourfold. Today, sub-Saharan Africa's 48 nations have a collective economic output that does not much surpass that of Belgium. Poland alone has more roads. Africa's share of world trade has steadily declined to less than 2 percent. Africa depends more on foreign aid today than ever, the reports says. Loans and grants from rich nations account for 10 percent of total economic activity, and a heavy debt burden constrains the ability of governments to put their fiscal houses in order. Infectious diseases like malaria and AIDS take more of a toll now than at any time since the early part of the 20th century. Africa accounts for 70 percent of the AIDS cases reported around the world. Even if progress against the disease is made, experts expect AIDS to reduce the average African life expectancy by 20 years, erasing all the gains since World War II. Endemic corruption and war, including the conflicts in Ethiopia as well as western and central Africa, are the main causes of the bleak performance, the report says. But the World Bank accepts some blame. The report says the bank and its sister agencies have wasted billions on ill-conceived projects. Even when projects were carefully managed, they sometimes competed with national governments, drawing talented bureaucrats and leaving nations ""project rich and cash poor,"" it says. The bank calls on rich countries to open their markets to imports of African goods. Wealthy nations collectively spend $300 billion to subsidize and protect their own farmers against foreign competition, the report says, a figure that is as large Africa's total economic output.  http://www.nytimes.com"2-Jun-00,CHAD (98%); CAMEROON (94%); AFRICA (92%); NIGER (92%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (92%); NIGERIA (92%); UNITED STATES (79%);,"A controversial $ 3.7 billion oil and pipeline project in Chad and Cameroon will finally be put to a vote by the World Bank's board of directors on June 6. The project, the largest construction venture in sub-Saharan Africa, involves the drilling of 300 oil wells in Chad and the construction of a 650-mile pipeline from southern Chad through Cameroon to the Atlantic Ocean. Exxon Mobil Corp. is leading a consortium, which includes Chevron, in charge of the enterprise. The World Bank's share of the financing--a $ 365 million loan--has met with stiff resistance from environmental groups concerned about ecology and human rights violations by the government of Chad. These nongovernmental organizations say the project will cut through rain forests in Cameroon and lead to the forced eviction of inhabitants in the area. Board members of the bank have raised concerns about corruption and the fate of the displaced. Daphne Wysham, a research fellow focusing on environmental issues at the Washington-based Institute for Policy Studies, said the World Bank is ""gambling with the lives of the poorest."" Supporters of the project at the bank say it is taking a gamble in the interest of those people. Two weeks ago, Wysham said, military and administrative officials loyal to Chadian leader Idriss Deby ""threatened to kill men, women and children supporting the rebellion in Chad and those who oppose the oil extraction project. We have this from reliable sources and human rights groups in Chad we unfortunately cannot name."" Chad has experienced ethnic, regional and political upheaval. Wysham, citing the example of oil company and government collusion in the Niger Delta at the expense of the local population, said she feared another ""nightmare"" in which ""the poor are made poorer by corrupt officials, constant oil spills and deadly joint military and oil company responses to protests."" Human Rights Watch has said Chevron was responsible for a number of serious environmental hazards, including the pollution of the water supply in the Niger Delta. The late Nigerian military leader Sani Abacha misused the country's oil wealth and dealt harshly with his opponents. Now torture victims and their families are suing Chevron in U.S. courts for complicity in human rights abuses by the Nigerian military against unarmed protesters. The protesters, some of whom were killed, were seeking to draw attention to oil spills and and their own neglected economic needs. Other groups based here, such as the Chadian Association for the Defense and Promotion of Human Rights and the Center for International Environmental Law, issued a news release yesterday discussing the threats against the Chadian opponents of the project. ""Under the constant threat of brutal government repression, it is highly unlikely that the citizens of Chad will reap any benefits from the World Bank's proposed oil pipeline if it goes forward now and, clearly, they stand to be harmed if they try to voice their concerns,"" said Delphine Djiraibe, a spokeswoman for the association. The nongovernmental organizations involved in the issue have called for a two-year moratorium to allow Chad to develop a proper legal framework, and establish environmental safeguards and human rights protections. The Exxon Mobil-led consortium will not go ahead without the World Bank because of the volatility of the region and the need for adequate management, which they want the World Bank to provide. The project is projected to bring $ 28 billion to the consortium in the next 20 years and $ 1 billion to the government of Chad. Affected communities will receive $ 600,000 in an endowment plan for resettlement. ""This oil will not be developed without private investment. Chad has been waiting since 1969, when oil was discovered there. We think the deal is within international norms, a fair deal,"" said Robert Calderisi, the World Bank spokesman for Africa. The bank has created a revenue management plan that has been severely criticized as leaving loopholes for Chad in a study prepared by Peter Rosenblum, a professor at Harvard University involved with human rights work. ""Our view is not only is this [plan] adequate, but it sets a precedent and a model for oil revenue management,"" Calderisi said. The plan calls for setting aside 80 percent of revenue to invest in rural health and needs, 10 percent to be invested overseas for future generations and 5 percent for development of oil production capacity, he said. ""We know we are taking a risk. It is the result of seasoned judgment that likely benefits far outweigh the risks,"" Calderisi said. Once the project is operational it will add between 45 and 50 percent to Chad's annual revenue and a much smaller 3 percent to Cameroon's public revenue, he added.  Room at the Top  Margaret Jay, the leader of Britain's House of Lords and the Labor Party government's minister for women, told Washington Post editors and reporters yesterday that her country ""needed to learn from the U.S. experience how to make sure that top universities are open to every good student--whatever their background. You've done it at Harvard and Yale. We should do it at Oxford and Cambridge."" She spoke amid a controversy at home over Harvard's acceptance, with a considerable financial package, of an outstanding British public high school student who had been rejected by Oxford. Jay, who addressed the Oxford and Cambridge Committee's 54th annual dinner, said she also was here to look into plans for encouraging entrepreneurship credit and to help get some women off welfare rolls."6-Jun-00,CHAD (96%); UNITED STATES (95%); CAMEROON (94%); AFRICA (94%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%); FRANCE (77%);,"With American support, the World Bank is expected to approve on Tuesday a $3.5 billion project to develop an oil pipeline in Chad and Cameroon in West Africa, despite widespread concerns about the potential for corruption and environmental damage. The Clinton administration will vote in favor of World Bank sponsorship after specifying an unusually detailed list of safeguards that officials hope will earmark the oil revenues for development projects and ward off abuse, a senior American official said today. Although the project does not have united European support, the United States, as the major shareholder in World Bank, is confident that there will be enough votes for a loan to pass, the official said. Exxon Mobil is the lead company that is seeking the loan. The World Bank is generally expected to contribute $90 million to $200 million. The proposed 663-mile pipeline, which would link oil fields in landlocked Chad to the Atlantic Coast of Cameroon, has stirred an outcry among environmentalists and antipoverty crusaders. They say the project will provide a boon to corrupt African officials, dislocate indigenous peoples and harm ecologically sensitive areas. The senior American official said critics had ""very legitimate concerns."" But after more than two years working with the oil companies, officials and independent figures in both countries, he said, planners have come ""a very long way"" in addressing them. ""This is a project with substantial development potential,"" the official said. ""I'm confident that it will be approved."" Environmental groups contend that the companies have failed to set aside adequate money to clean up an oil spill, allocating less than $1 million, despite Dutch researchers' citing a need for $28 million. The pipeline, the critics add, will threaten the livelihoods of hundreds of Bagueli people, or pygmies, and endanger the habitats of endangered black rhinos, gorillas and chimpanzees. ""Any time you lay a pipeline, you're basically building a road for loggers and poachers,"" said Alejandro Queral, associate Washington representative of the Sierra Club. Other critics say the World Bank will effectively be lining the pockets of a corrupt government in Chad that the State Department says brutally persecutes its enemies. Nearly every region of Chad, a nation two and a half times the size of France, has erupted in ethnically based unrest. Providing oil revenues to the central government is ""like adding more fuel to the fire,"" asserted Korrina Horta, a senior economist at Environmental Defense in Washington. ""It's a very dangerous situation,"" Ms. Horta added. Exxon Mobil has insisted on World Bank participation as a hedge against instability, Ms. Horta said. She referred to the bank's role, which represents less than 10 percent of the project, as ""political risk insurance"" for investors. ""You make the World Bank a shareholder in the project, and no government is ever going to nationalize it,"" Ms. Horta said. In addition, the support clears the way for Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Petronas to seek additional financing before investing $3 billion of their own, she said, adding, ""It's the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval."" In tandem with its support for the loan, the administration has insisted on a framework to be monitored by the World Bank that would reduce the risk of corruption or mismanagement. That structure would include an escrow account for oil revenues that would set aside most of the income for health, education and development and allow for monitoring by nongovernmental groups in Chad. The American-backed strictures also require that money be set aside to create national parks, compensate displaced people and respond to oil spills. The pipeline would be one of the largest that involves direct foreign investment in Africa in decades, officials said. Experts expect it to generate $80 million to $100 million a year for Chad and $20 million in transfer fees for Cameroon. American officials acknowledged that the project would be something of a test for the World Bank. Last week, the bank released a report in which it faulted itself and the International Monetary Fund for making Africa poorer through failed lending policies over 40 years.  http://www.nytimes.com An article on Tuesday about the World Bank's consideration of an oil pipeline in Africa referred incorrectly to a recent report by the bank on African poverty. The study concluded that Africans were poorer than 40 years ago and that a share of the blame belonged to the bank and the International Monetary Fund. But the contention that the two organizations had made the continent poorer through failed lending policies came from recent Washington demonstrators, not from the study."10-Jul-00,AFRICA (94%); CAMEROON (94%); CHAD (94%); CENTRAL AFRICA (90%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%);,"Behind the hills next to this Pygmy village in the Central African rain forest, a pipeline is to be built in a few years to carry oil to the Atlantic coast, where it will be shipped to the West. The pipeline, which the World Bank endorsed in June after heated debates, will be a huge project, costing $3.7 billion. It represents a big, risky test for the bank and for African development policies. Historically, the oil exploitation in Africa has generated ruinous corruption or long-running wars, not wealth for nations and their citizens. In this village, there are both doubts and hopes. ""I don't know where the oil is coming from and where it's going,"" said the village chief, Marc Nzie. ""I only know it will pass behind those hills. If they stay behind those hills, then it's no problem. We won't hunt there anymore. We'll go the other way."" But he said that in this village, which is without electricity, ""if the pipeline is going to pass behind those hills, they have to give us light."" Even before the World Bank voted on June 6, the pipeline drew a level of opposition in the West unusual for an African project. Human rights and environmental groups had joined forces with residents here and in neighboring Chad, the two countries the pipeline would cross. The underground pipeline is to start in southern Chad, a landlocked desert nation where oil was discovered three decades ago but where civil wars and unrest have prevented exploitation, leaving it one of the poorest countries. ""We were very interested in working with Chad to find a way of exploiting these oil resources in a way which would channel these benefits for the poor and to make a difference in terms of poverty,"" said Callisto Madavo, the World Bank's vice president for sub-Saharan Africa. ""The stakes are very high. We should be able to pull this thing off. But I wasn't born yesterday. There are risks, and I wouldn't underplay them."" Before the 665-mile pipeline ends, in Kribi, it will have to cross the Sahel in Chad, the savanna and mountains of northeastern Cameroon and the virgin rain forests in the south, where the canopy of trees is broken only by loggers and Pygmy villages like this one. To reach this village near the pipeline route, a traveler has to follow a footpath that breaks off a dirt road and winds through the forest up and down muddy hills and across creeks to Mabolo, a village of 13 mud huts. On one morning, heavy rains had dissuaded the men from going into the forest to hunt. Many sat together in an open area. A knock on the chief's door found him on a bamboo bed, suffering from malaria. Mr. Nzie, in his 50's, is renowned as a healer, but he had been unable to rid himself of a persistent case of malaria. He calls it ""Kabila,"" after President Laurent Kabila of Congo, whom the Rwandans and Ugandans, who are supporting the rebels, have been unable to oust for two years. The chief's eldest son, Louis Bitouti, 27, who was building a toy truck, said many younger Pygmies hoped to get jobs from the pipeline. ""Why not?"" asked Mr. Bitouti, who like other Pygmies here uses his grandfather's name as his last name. ""I want to be rich like everyone else. If I lose my father here, how will I live?"" The villagers founded Mabolo five decades ago, they said, and with about 50 inhabitants it was one of the biggest Pygmy villages in the region. Although Pygmies are traditionally nomadic hunters, the villagers have become somewhat sedentary, continuing to hunt deep in the forest but also growing cassava and yam. In this country of 14 million people, the Pygmies, the indigenous rain forest dwellers, number perhaps 100,000. They have remained without formal schooling, and few speak French, the language of the former colonial rulers. The dominant ethnic groups in Cameroon often discriminate against the Pygmies. Many Pygmies have been forced out of their home areas by logging companies and security forces, several human rights studies report, including the State Department report on human rights in Cameroon in 1999. A peaceful people, the Pygmies have, perhaps inevitably, become a focus of those opposed to the pipeline. The Pygmies may be the most vulnerable and have the most to lose. Under the plan, the World Bank will give $200 million in loans to the Chad and Cameroon governments. The amount is small, given the cost of the project, which will be borne mostly by the oil companies involved in the joint venture, Exxon Mobil, which would have 40 percent; Chevron, another American company, 25 percent; and a Malaysian company, Petronas, 35 percent. The World Bank support is far more important to the companies than its financial contribution. Many diplomats in the region say they believe that the companies would have withdrawn and that Chad would have turned to other partners, perhaps Libya, if the bank had not voted yes. In the last quarter of a century, the western African coast between Nigeria and Angola has become one of the hottest spots for oil exploration. But the Western multinational companies have come under increasing criticism for their practices, especially Royal Dutch Shell in Nigeria and Elf Aquitaine in Gabon and the Congo Republic, whose capital is Brazzaville. ""There is not one example in Africa where oil has led to development,"" said Samuel Nguiffo, secretary general of the Center for the Environment and Development, a leading environmental organization here. ""Look at Nigeria, Angola, the two Congos, Gabon. They all have an overabundance of oil, and what do they have to show for it? ""We can even say that the exploitation of oil has retarded their development. What are the chances that things will be any different in Chad or Cameroon?"" In an interview in the capital, Yaounde, where he was visiting officials, Mr. Madavo said he was aware of the history of oil here. He said he was also aware that Chad had a poor human rights record and that Transparency International, an organization based in Berlin that studies corruption, had ranked it the most corrupt country for two years. ""It's very, very important that the World Bank, as an economic institution, not become so risk averse that it would only do the sure thing,"" he said. Early in June, the bank decided to proceed with the biggest project that it has been associated with in Africa. In Washington, officials at the State and Commerce Departments backed the plan. Their counterparts at the Agency for International Development and the Environmental Protection Agency, concerned about how the oil revenues would be spent and the pipeline's environmental effects, opposed it. Under the agreement with the bank, Chad agreed to a spending plan for its oil revenues, with 80 percent for education, health, social services, rural development and infrastructure; 10 percent to be kept in a trust for the future; and 5 percent earmarked for development in the oil-producing region of Doba. The last 5 percent would be discretionary. In Chad, where 80 percent of the seven million inhabitants live on less than $1 a day, the oil revenues would amount to up to half of the national budget. Oil money is widely expected to start flowing in four years and to last for 25 years, for a total of $2 billion. The government has pledged to respect its part of the bargain. ""There will not be any place for predators of oil revenues,"" President Idriss Deby said in a speech after the bank had voted. ""We will make sure that every centime from oil will produce a positive effect in the life of every Chadian family."" The money that Cameroon would derive is estimated at $500 million, or 3 percent of the national budget. Concerns in this country center more on the ecological effects, because many environmental group contend that the huge oil companies have used substandard controls while exploiting oil in places like the Niger Delta in Nigeria. Didier Amougou, an official at Planet Survey, a Cameroonian environmental organization, said groups like his had shifted from opposing the project to trying to ensure that it would be properly built and managed. He said his group would also try to make certain that those affected by the construction would receive fair compensation, especially the Pygmies, who are dominated by Bantus in the rain forest. ""To the Pygmies, we are the white men,"" said Dieudonne Mbuel, 37, a Bantu, explaining how the Bantus had seized most of the rain forest from Pygmies. Mr. Mbuel, who lives in a nearby Bantu village, Madoungou, said he had received $500 from the joint venture because the pipeline is expected to pass through his land. He expected more. ""You see this mango tree?"" he asked, standing in the thick of the forest and pointing to a tree taller than the others. ""They'll have to compensate me for that."" None of the Pygmies interviewed have received any compensation, although some are eventually supposed to under the agreement. Not too far away, in Ndamayo, Jean Bikanda, a Pygmy, said he did not believe that he would ever receive any money for the pipeline. Several months ago, loggers ripped through the forest, creating a road just in front of his house. He received no compensation, he pointed out. Asked his age, Mr. Bikanda stood up in his hut and opened a nylon bag that was hanging in a corner. He took out his identity card, which most people in Cameroon have. But he was one of the few Pygmies interviewed who had one. Born in 1938, the card read, ""Profession: Chasseur."" Hunter. The prey that Mr. Bikanda hunts -- rats, porcupines, rabbits, boars and antelopes -- fled deeper into the forest because of the loggers, he said. ""Maybe we will get work from this pipeline,"" he added. ""Maybe this will be good for Cameroon."" But his son Pierre Mbang, 34, said: ""Work is good, but the forest is our life. Work is good, but it will end."" The son was unsure what to make of the World Bank decision. ""That's where all the money in the world is kept,"" he said of the bank, reinforcing the distance between bank decisions and life on the ground. Mr. Madavo, the bank vice president, who is from Zimbabwe, was hopeful. ""If it succeeds,"" he said, ""wouldn't that be wonderful for a story to be written 20 years from now, that on an issue where there was a lot of doubt and skepticism, that the World Bank stood up, did its homework, supported something that made a tremendous difference to Africa? I would love to be alive to see that.""  http://www.nytimes.com A picture caption on Monday about an oil pipeline that is to run from Chad through Cameroon to the Atlantic Ocean referred incorrectly to construction in a Pygmy village.

Then suddenly in 1996, after Spanish and French oilmen had left, the Americans struck liquid gold. The discovery was so unexpected that the State Department, in a cost-cutting measure, had closed its embassy in Equatorial Guinea several weeks earlier and had begun handling relations with this economic backwater from its embassy in neighboring Cameroon. The embassy has yet to reopen, but American investments here are now estimated at nearly $5 billion. The figure would rank this obscure nation fourth in American investments in sub-Saharan Africa, behind only more familiar places like South Africa and the two oil giants, Nigeria and Angola. ""They said there was no interest and no possibility of finding oil in Equatorial Guinea,"" Cristobal Manana Ela, the country's minister of mines and energy, said of the earlier exploration companies. ""But we were very optimistic about our geology. We knew it was logical that if Nigeria was producing, Cameroon was producing and Gabon was producing, here in Equatorial Guinea we could be producing."" Here in the capital, which is groaning under the weight of an influx of foreigners, there is heady talk of Equatorial Guinea -- population 465,000 -- becoming a Kuwait of Africa. There is also an acute awareness that the same term was applied decades ago to countries like Gabon, which despite a small population and huge oil reserves remains dependent on foreign aid because of mismanagement and corruption. So Equatorial Guinea stands at a crossroad: significant oil production started two years ago, and it will be two more before the government's coffers begin filling with piles of cash unimaginable until now. People in Africa and the West will watch closely what the government does with its money, and how the oil companies, especially Exxon Mobil, the main producer, operate here. The scrutiny will be greater than it has been elsewhere because Equatorial Guinea's oil production comes when governments and human rights organizations in the West have rallied around the reality that Africa's riches -- diamonds or oil -- have seldom improved the lives of average Africans and often enriched only corrupt African leaders and their Western partners. Indeed, African oil has perhaps never been as politicized as it is now, as suggested by the fierce debates about the World Bank's endorsement of a $3.7 billion pipeline between Chad and Cameroon. In an interview, Mr. Manana, who was accompanied by Gabriel Nguema Lima, the secretary of state at the Ministry of Mines and Energy and a son of Equatorial Guinea's president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, said the government had already held a conference to examine how and why its neighbors had squandered their oil dollars, ""to evaluate what to do not to have the same thing happen here."" An international development official who has been in Equatorial Guinea for three years said there had been some positive changes. ""The government and the country are much more open to the outside than when I first arrived here,"" the official said. ""But so far there have been few positive effects on the lives of Equatorial Guineans. That has been the case for all of Central Africa. A country's natural resources are regarded as the patrimony of the head of state. We'll have to wait and see if things will be different here."" The outside interest will be a big change for Equatorial Guinea, which long remained severely isolated for a number of reasons. Its capital lies on an island connected to the mainland only by irregular flights, most of them aboard rickety second-hand Soviet-era planes. As the only sub-Saharan country to have been colonized by Spain, its Spanish-speaking citizens are surrounded by people who speak French or English. And then its first post-independence president, Francisco Macias Nguema, ruled with a brutality comparable to that of tyrants like Idi Amin of Uganda, driving a third of the population into exile. He was overthrown in 1979 and executed by a government led by his nephew, the current president, Mr. Obiang. Mr. Obiang cautiously opened up the country, building links to France and French-speaking African nations. But there is still little political openness, and other legacies of the country's isolation survive. In Malabo, there is not a single newsstand. The country's leaders would have probably continued ruling quietly, unnoticed by the rest of the world, had it not been for the oil found in 1996. In 1997, gross domestic product shot up 76 percent, according to the African Development Bank, and has kept climbing by two digits since then. Today, Exxon Mobil pumps 112,000 barrels a day. A new $560 million platform started production last month, even as another American company, Triton Energy, announced a big find. Other American companies are expected to arrive this year to search in unexplored waters. Ken Keag, the director general here of CMS Energy, a Houston oil company, described the oil companies' interest in Equatorial Guinea as intense. ""It's not unreasonable to imagine Equatorial Guinea producing one barrel per person per day in a few years,"" Mr. Keag said, alluding to production of half a million barrels a day. CMS Energy, which pumps a modest 9,000 barrels a day, and two other American companies are building a $420 million methanol plant here scheduled to be completed next year. As an indication of how ill prepared Equatorial Guinea was for all this new investment, the plant's builders have had to be completely self-sufficient. They have built a camp to house about 800 foreign workers because of the severe shortage of hotels and housing in Malabo; they have their own electrical power and their own fresh water filter and sewage treatment systems. On weekdays, this city of Spanish colonial buildings now buzzes with car and pedestrian traffic. It is nothing on the level of a typical African capital but enough that every day recalls the activity seen only on payday before the oil boom. More than anything the city buzzes with the intangible, the promise of oil and its potential benefits. ""Bar Internet,"" said the sign on a hole in the wall here with plenty to drink but not one computer. Only a few people in the government and the oil companies know how much money Equatorial Guinea has earned so far from oil, and they are not saying. Mr. Manana, the mines and energy minister, pointed instead to the improvements made in the last two years in Malabo: the new paved roads and a new electricity plant that provides reliable power for most residents of Malabo, whose population has topped 50,000 since the oil boom started. Before being the host for a conference of Central African nations last year, the government built a convention hall and 17 villas for visiting dignitaries. But there are other developments the government shies away from publicizing: the new presidential wing at the airport, a shiny glass structure with a dozen parking spots that sits incongruously on the side of a simple airport made up essentially of a runway and a small building. A drive through the rich neighborhood known as Little Spain shows construction workers busy on new villas -- houses that pale in comparison with the villas of, say, Nigeria, but dwarf the shanties in the slum of Newbuil across town. Newbuil, whose name is short for ""new building,"" is a sprawling collection of wobbly houses jammed together beside open gutters. The neighborhood was created some four decades ago to house mostly Nigerians who had come to work on Equatorial Guinea's cacao plantations. It enjoyed a certain seedy reputation -- to describe someone as a ""Newbuil girl"" or ""Newbuil guy"" still amounts to an insult. Newbuil's dirt streets were muddy from the rains on a recent Friday. Still, there were signs that the oil money had begun trickling down. Antennas rose from aluminum roofs, above houses in which there had been no television sets until a year or two ago. ""There were no traffic lights before and now we have electricity 24 hours a day,"" said Nicanor Obama, 22, who was selling medication by the pill at the Botiquin drugstore in Newbuil. ""It is a development that should accelerate."" But the arrival of a greater variety of goods at the main market, especially second-hand clothes with ""Nike"" and ""Adidas"" tags from Europe, had taken away business from Emil Epee, a tailor. Voicing a simmering resentment that most were still afraid to express, Mr. Epee said: ""All I know is that I have to eat, and it is you who are eating our oil money. We are not eating any of this oil money. The only money I eat is from my clothes. It's our oil, but it's you Americans who are eating our oil."" Whether those feelings become more widespread will surely depend on how wide the distance between Newbuil and Little Spain becomes. Politically, the reforms have been mixed. Most people acknowledge that years of repression have given way to greater freedom. Soldiers do not harass ordinary people as openly or frequently as they once did. ""People can walk freely,"" said Isabel Tonka, 25, who is a member of the Bubi ethnic group, the indigenous people of this island, which is now dominated by Bantu people from the mainland. ""It is not like before. I can go to my village and come back to Malabo without hassle."" Raimundo Evemba Melenga, the director of a private publishing group, and others recalled applying for a permit to start a newspaper. The application languished for two years, Mr. Evemba said, so they submitted an application for another newspaper. To their surprise, both applications were approved by the government a few months ago. ""We have published several times since then without any government interference,"" Mr. Evemba said of the two newspapers, Tiempo and La Opinion, which locals and foreigners in Malabo said have been sharply critical of the government. But opposition leaders said that in other ways the government's control had grown tighter. Before oil was discovered, the government often yielded to foreign pressure to allow some degree of political openness, said Placido Miko Abogo, the secretary general of the Convergence for Social Democracy party and the country's best-known opponent of the prevailing political order. ""Now that they have money, they don't care what the outside thinks,"" Mr. Miko said. ""Oil has made them more arrogant, more intolerant."" The government argues that municipal elections last month, won overwhelmingly by the president's party, were free and fair. Foreign observers agreed, but pointed out there was no real political opposition. Truly independent parties boycotted the election. Mr. Miko said others were bought by the ruling party. ""There's a lot of oil money that the government can use simply to buy people off now,"" he said. ""It's a new strategy, but the end is the same. We are returning to a situation with only one political party.""  http://www.nytimes.com Map of Africa highlighting Malabo: Discovery of oil hs caused foreigners to flock to Malabo.

There can be hope for Africa.' TONY BLAIR Prime Minister, Britain There is a dismal record of failure in Africa on the part of the developed world that shocks and shames our civilization. Twenty-one of the 44 countries in sub-Saharan Africa are affected by conflict which undermines efforts at development. Even worse, 10 times as many people died of AIDS in Africa last year as were killed in all continent's wars combined. Nowhere are more people dying needlessly from starvation, from disease, from conflict. Deaths caused not by acts of fate, but by acts of man. By bad governance, factional rivalries, state-sponsored theft and corruption. Nowhere are more people being left behind on the wrong side of a growing digital and educational divide, children being denied the opportunities that will transform the lives of their contemporaries elsewhere in the world. Yet, 30 years ago, the same depressing analysis might have been made of parts of Asia or Latin America. There can be change. There can be hope for Africa. There is political leadership, business opportunity and above all the will on behalf of people for a better future in Africa. We must be partners in the search for change and hope. 'Blind laws are offered like divine norms.' FIDEL CASTRO President, Cuba There is chaos in our world, both within the countries' borders and beyond. Blind laws are offered like divine norms that would bring peace, order, well-being and the security our planet so badly needs. That is what they would have us believe. Three dozen developed and wealthy nations that monopolize the economic, political and technological power have joined us in this gathering to offer more of the same recipes that have only served to make us poorer, more exploited and more dependent. There is not even discussion about a radical reform of this old institution -- born over a half-century ago when there were few independent nations -- to turn into a true representative body of the interests of all the peoples on Earth; an institution where no one would have the irritating and anti-democratic right of veto and where a transparent process could be undertaken to expand membership and representation in the Security Council, an executive body subordinated to the General Assembly, which should be the one making the decisions on such crucial issues as intervention and the use of force. It should be clearly stated that the principle of sovereignty cannot be sacrificed to an abusive and unfair order that a hegemonic superpower uses, together with its own might and strength, to try to decide everything by itself. That Cuba will never accept. 'A moral and humane world with liberty and progress.' MOHAMMAD KHATAMI President, Iran Democratic principles have gradually become the criteria of good-governance domestically. They deserve to become the new norm governing global interactions. Therefore, the exigencies of a few power holders should not supersede the interest of humanity through familiar practices of endorsement of undemocratic governments, not responsive to the will and needs of their people, and application of double and multiple standards of response to incidents around the globe. Moreover, the structure of power in our contemporary world must be reformed. In a global society whose constituents, much like equal individuals within nation-states, are nations of equal right and dignity, diverse cultures and civilizations can and should work collectively to build a moral and humane world with liberty and progress for all. 'We live in a society, not a marketplace.' BERTIE AHERN Prime Minister, Ireland The statistics of poverty and inequality in our world are shocking and shameful. Half the world's population struggling on less than $2 a day; over a billion on less than $1. A quarter of a billion children of 14 and under working, sometimes in terrible conditions. Death from preventable and treatable diseases; 10 people will die of malaria in the five minutes I take to address you. There was much talk some years ago of a ""new world order."" A new order is indeed dawning. The capacity of globalization to transform our economies and societies is enormous. But, unless shaped by a value system, globalization will mean an ever more lopsided world. The level playing field will remain an illusion as long as a majority of players are ill fed, ill trained and ill equipped. Perhaps the phrase ""fair world order"" better sums up what we should strive for. It recognizes that we live in a society, not a marketplace. It admits concepts of justice and human solidarity. It acknowledges that, while not everyone will live in the same way, we are all entitled to dignity and decency. 'At the Rubicon, and neither of us can cross it alone.' EHUD BARAK Prime Minister, Israel The opportunity for peace in the Middle East is now at hand, and must not be missed. We envision a peace that will preserve the vital interests and the dignity of all sides. But no one side can achieve 100 percent of its dreams if we are to succeed. My own government has shown, in negotiations with Syria and the Palestinians, as in our full implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, that it can make painful decisions for the sake of peace. It remains to be seen whether our counterparts are also capable of rising to the magnitude of the hour. The member states of the United Nations can lend a pivotal hand by encouraging the difficult process of reconciliation, and by opposing any unilateral measures, which may well spark a renewed cycle of violence and obliterate the prospects of peace. I call out to Chairman Arafat to join me in this historic passage. We are at the Rubicon, and neither of us can cross it alone. 'New horizons for secure life on the planet.' VLADIMIR V. PUTIN President, Russia The new century of the United Nations should prolong itself into a millennium of effective stability. It has to enter the annals of history as the period of real disarmament. . . . We should reliably block the ways for spreading of nuclear weapons. We can achieve this by, inter alia, excluding usage of enriched uranium and pure plutonium in the world atomic energy production. This is technically quite possible to implement. But more important is that incineration of plutonium and other radioactive elements creates prerequisites for the final solution of the radioactive residues problem. It opens fundamentally new horizons for secure life on the planet. In this connection Russia proposes to work out and put into practice a relevant mechanism with the participation of the I.A.E.A. Particularly alarming are the plans for militarization of the outer space. In spring of 2001 we shall celebrate the 40th anniversary of the first flight of man to the outer space. That man was our compatriot, and we suggest to organize on that date, under the umbrella of the U.N., an international conference on prevention of the outer space militarization. I think that the most proper place for it shall be Moscow.  'As part of a global village, we should work together.' HASINA WAZED Prime Minister, Bangladesh Can we afford islands of prosperity in an ocean of suffering and darkness? Let us resolve that as part of a global village, we should work together so that all can benefit from the process of globalization and we can have a win-win at the end. Globalization and a borderless world are not a panacea for all social and economic ills. While they can reinforce the rich and the powerful, they can also impoverish the weak and the vulnerable. 'We all know that the U.N. plays a major role.' JACQUES CHIRAC President, France Our world, which is still fraught with political, economic and financial crises, does not suffer from a surfeit of rules, but from the problems of keeping international law and practices abreast of change and progress. If we are to build a world order that meets the needs of our times, we must strengthen and improve the coexistence of great institutions such as I.M.F., the World Bank, the W.T.O. and, first of all, the U.N. We all know that the U.N. plays a major role. In its first half-century of existence, this universal, democratic institution has become irreplaceable. We must let it adapt to today's world.  By modernizing the methods of the General Assembly, which is the world's Parliament in a way. By supporting the reforms undertaken by our secretary general, Mr. Kofi Annan, whom I would like to salute here. By making the best use of the information revolution. And finally, by providing the necessary resources, as the European Union countries do, supplying more than one-third of the budget and half of the financing for U.N. funds and programs. This will enable the U.N. to fulfill its duties and influence the course of world history. 'There should not be only one color in the universe.' JIANG ZEMIN President, China The world is diverse and colorful. Just as there should not be only one color in the universe, so there should not be only one civilization, one social system, one development model or one set of values in the world. Each and every country and nation has made its own contribution to the development of human civilization. It is essential to fully respect the diversity of different nations, religions and civilizations, whose co-existence is the very source of vigorous development in the world. We should promote the exchanges between different civilizations in a spirit of equality and democracy and encourage them to learn from one another in order to attain common progress. Dialogue and cooperation in the field of human rights must be conducted on the basis of respect for state sovereignty. This is the fundamental and most effective way to protect and promote human rights. So long as there are boundaries between states, and people live in their respective countries, to maintain national independence and safeguard sovereignty will be the supreme interests of each government and people. Without sovereignty, there will be no human rights to speak of. 'Inaction speaks louder than words.' MAUMOON ABDUL GAYMOOM President, Maldives To those who learn from mistakes the past is a good guide for the future. But let us not go back a thousand years. Let us go forward to a hundred years hence. When the U.N. meets to usher in yet another century, will the Maldives and other low-lying island nations be represented here? Not only a sobering thought, but an alarming one. Now, I have only 30 seconds left. It would be a pity to disperse from this gathering without a final commitment to save the earth. I don't wish to be cynical, but, are we to believe that the world really cares? Are we to believe that all humanity is one? Inaction speaks louder than words.  http://www.nytimes.com"16-Sep-00,NIGERIA (94%); AZERBAIJAN (79%); INDONESIA (79%); UKRAINE (79%); NETHERLANDS (79%); ICELAND (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); NEW ZEALAND (79%); GERMANY (77%); AUSTRIA (57%);   SINGAPORE (79%);,"When a country gets the reputation of being deeply corrupt, it takes a lot of time -- and more than just the election of an anticorruption government -- to improve on its negative image, a watchdog group says. The group, Transparency International, uses the case of Nigeria to make that point in its 2000 Corruption Perception Index. Nigeria, under President Olusegun Obasanjo, a former advisory council chairman of Transparency International, is still at the bottom of the index, more than a year after the change of government that restored democracy after a period of corrupt military rule. In part, the low ranking is related to a change in this year's index, a measure of perceptions about corruption drawn from surveys by international economic organizations and risk analysts. For the first time, Transparency International, an independent organization founded in 1995 by former World Bank officials to expose corruption among public officials worldwide, used data from a three-year period, not a single year. Change takes time to register, says the report, which was issued on Wednesday. ""Valiant efforts are being made by President Olusegun Obasanjo to force full-scale changes in a country whose people have been robbed by the grand corruption of their past leaders,"" said Peter Eigen, chairman of Transparency International, which has chapters in more than 70 countries. ""But the process of change initiated by the new president is barely 12 months old, and so it is not surprising that Nigeria's C.P.I. score is virtually unchanged."" In the perception of business people, Transparency International found this year that officials in Yugoslavia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Indonesia and Angola, in ascending order after Nigeria, are also at the bottom of the table, which ranks countries on a score of 10 for the least corrupt to zero for the most corrupt. They all have scores below 2. The 10 countries ranked as least corrupt are, in descending order, Finland, Denmark, New Zealand, Sweden, Canada, Iceland, Norway, Singapore, the Netherlands and Britain. The United States is in 14th place, with 7.8 points on the 10-point scale. It ranks at about the same level as Austria, Hong Kong, Germany and Chile.

The recurrent images of clashes between hooded demonstrators and police officers defending the barons of global capitalism have become a powerful motif for the protests and preoccupations of a new millennium. At first blush, the demonstrators' rage may bewilder many Westerners. After all, whether the body under assault is the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank, the institutions' stated aims are surely laudable: liberalized trade, economic rescue and development. But the protests -- seizing on targets as disparate as finance ministers' gatherings and McDonald's outlets -- have touched a raw nerve at a time when the gap between rich and poor is widening, when many poor countries labor under unpayable debt inherited from the politically driven international lending of the cold war and when trade, for many, means little more than an uneven exchange of expensive Western goods for cheap commodities. Nowhere are these issues more evident than in Africa. And as Michela Wrong's ""In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz"" (Fourth Estate) appears to suggest, no single African country has taken the bizarre interface of ill-fated international lending and corrupt politics to the same extremes as Congo, the former Zaire. As the title suggests, this is not a ""business"" book or a dry academic study. It is a journalist's fast-paced account of the final years of the regime of the late President Mobutu Sese Seko, whose blend of greed, corruption and hunger for power fascinated generations of reporters from his rise to power in 1965 to his ignominious demise in 1997. It is a book whose time is right, because it illuminates much of the current debate underlying the protests in Seattle and Prague. (Published in London, the book will be issued in the United States by HarperCollins next May.) It points an accusing finger at the readiness of the International Monetary Fund to almost encourage the errant ways of a political elite that it was avowedly rescuing from itself. And, not least for anyone who contemplates greasing the wheels of business in pursuit of a quick deal, it demonstrates the perils of corruption -- a force that, in Congo's case, led directly to a national implosion. Mr. Mobutu was hardly a stranger to harsh scrutiny. No visitor to Kinshasa, the capital, in his heyday in the 1970's and 1980's could avoid the twin frisson of revulsion and bewitchment that the country inspired. Here was a dictator -- as this reporter can attest -- who kept caged leopards in his garden, dined off gold plates and repelled insurgents with the ready help of the United States Air Force and the French Foreign Legion, even as the African bush seemed to be reclaiming his decaying capital. Then as now, Congo drew outsiders into its heady web of bloodshed, absurdity and evil -- distant massacres offset against fine restaurants patronized by the elite, the pony-tailed pianist at the Hotel Intercontinental who played ""As Time Goes By"" and presidential extravagance on a scale as grand as the broad sweep of the Congo River. All this imbues the rich, anecdotal tapestry in the book, starting with a description of Mr. Mobutu's henchmen fleeing the capital, carrying machine guns and Louis Vuitton luggage as rebels advanced. (The absence of the pianist in May 1997, Ms. Wrong says, signaled that the end was nigh for Mr. Mobutu.) BUT Ms. Wrong takes the debate much further with her keen understanding of where, exactly, the Mobutu regime was coming from as the ultimate heir to a Belgian colonial administration founded on the awesome chutzpah of King Leopold II, who in the 19th century simply took over the Congo -- a country the size of western Europe -- as a personal fief. Ms. Wrong, who covered the final Mobutu years for Reuters and The Financial Times, has woven her title from an allusion to Kurtz, the central figure of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness,"" whose dying words -- ""the horror, the horror"" -- have inspired legions of journalists and moviemakers. She is quick to point out that those words have often been presented as an indictment of African ways rather than Kurtz's own acknowledgment of his own fall from grace. ""Conrad was more preoccupied with rotten Western values, the white man's inhumanity to the black man than, as is almost always assumed today, black savagery,"" she writes. And that brings her to the central theme. If Mr. Mobutu was the archvillain of his nation's tragedy, he was not a simple caricature, or, indeed, a man without a context. ""The momentum behind Zaire's free fall was generated not by one man but by thousands of compliant collaborators, at home and abroad."" This is no exculpation of Mr. Mobutu, but, in the present debate over the role of international financial institutions, it helps explain just why Congo -- and many other African countries to a less dramatic degree -- got into such an enormous financial mess. Indeed, it evokes a central question for the international institutions and donors of today as they contemplate the morass left over from the cold war: where is the morality in imposing yet more fiscal hardship on nations burdened by the same debts as those the ""compliant collaborators"" in the international community helped to create? Zaire is a particularly glaring example. But, as Ms. Wrong points out, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank were complicit -- by default at the very least -- in creating this monster. From 1975 to 1997, Zaire received $9.3 billion in foreign aid, much of it at the height of the cold war and much of it from the I.M.F. and the World Bank, at a time when the United States and other Western powers were determined to keep Mr. Mobutu in their camp. Yet throughout this period -- and particularly after the I.M.F. installed its own representative, Erwin Blumenthal, at Zaire's Central Bank in 1978 -- those institutions knew full well that Mr. Mobutu was stripping the state coffers not just of aid income but also of receipts from Zaire's fabled riches in copper, cobalt and diamonds. Mr. Blumenthal subsequently reported ample evidence of corruption, but any effort to restrain Mr. Mobutu was thwarted by bigger geopolitical considerations. In the thinking of the time, Ms. Wrong writes, ""No one wants to be the official remembered as having 'lost' Zaire, Kenya, Zambia or Tanzania."" Only in recent years have those same international institutions come to acknowledge that aid and other forms of assistance are inseparable from ""governance issues"" -- meaning that there is no point in trying to help people who are, literally, helping themselves to the state's riches. But, of course, the damage has been done. Debts have piled up, but forgiveness is hard to come by, usually involving wrenching economic reforms that look for signs of macroeconomic health long before they benefit ordinary people. And, in the bulk of sub-Saharan Africa, it is the ordinary people who have become more and more destitute. Not all of their leaders were corrupt. Often enough, in nations like Zambia and Tanzania, misguided economic stewardship did almost as much damage as Mr. Mobutu's kleptocracy -- the term that came to be applied to the robber regime. That, of course, is where the protesters in Seattle and Prague come into the picture, taking up the cudgels -- it could be argued as uninvited champions -- on behalf of those millions in many parts of Africa who have neither voice nor prospects. Ms. Wrong does not, however, oversimplify or sentimentalize the argument. Her account of Mr. Mobutu's interaction with wealth is far more nuanced, pointing out, for instance, that state corruption is an expensive business. Anyone looking for Mr. Mobutu's rumored hidden stash of looted billions, she suggests, will be disappointed: if he stole from the state, he did so in part to finance a network of complicit and equally corrupt lieutenants, ready to repay largess with loyalty. Neither is the issue made any simpler by the post-Mobutu regime of Laurent Kabila that seems a continuation of rather than a break with the history of venality. The protesters in Seattle and Prague might take note or, at least, cast a more searching look over those who lead the people that they champion.  http://www.nytimes.com Chart: ""Business Best Sellers"" HARDCOVER 1 WHO MOVED MY CHEESE? by Spencer Johnson (Putnam, $19.95).

Criticized for years over projects in developing nations that failed to return benefits to their populations, bank officials knew that the $ 3.7 billion pipeline--the most expensive infrastructure project now underway in Africa--would be closely scrutinized. So they imposed strict accounting standards and insisted on guarantees from the Chadian government to ensure that its oil profits--predicted to total as much as $ 100 million a year--would be spent to improve public health, education and vital infrastructure here, rather than disappearing into secret bank accounts or funding weapons purchases by those in power. World Bank officials said that their ""Chadian model"" would prove they could overcome the African nation's endemic corruption and that it might be applied to other corruption-prone oil-producing lands. So when Chadian President Idriss Deby declared last week that he had used $ 4.5 million of the government's first oil receipts to buy weapons instead of bolstering social programs, he sent a jolt through the bank. While the amount diverted was relatively small, World Bank officials, diplomats and Chadian advocacy groups expressed shock at its brazenness and concern that it might signal how Deby might deal with future oil revenue. Robert Calderisi, the World Bank director for Chad and several other central African countries, said he was ""sobered and disappointed"" by Deby's action, which he called an ""object lesson on the need for more transparency."" Calderisi warned that the bank and other institutions might disqualify Chad from a program for immediate debt relief that stood to save the country about $ 12 million a year. He also warned that the bank might simply bar any further projects in Chad, a nation with few natural resources where more than two-thirds of the population lives on an average of less than $ 250 a year. ""We cannot defend new projects in Chad if they violate agreements with us,"" Calderisi said. ""People are going to be very, very skeptical and reluctant to help Chad if they misuse the money."" The arms purchases ""should be a warning to show that when the oil money flows, the World Bank won't have any way to know what Deby will do with it,"" said Delphine K. Djiraibe, president of the Chadian Association for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights, which fought the pipeline for years. ""Deby feels very powerful and that he has nothing to worry about,"" she said. While the World Bank is financing only 3 percent of the pipeline project, its participation was crucial in persuading a consortium of three oil companies, led by Exxon Mobil Corp., to invest in it. Southern Chad's oil fields, which hold an estimated 1 billion barrels or more of crude, were discovered more than 30 years ago but were never developed--partly because of the pipeline's cost and partly because of Chadian history. Even by the standards of Africa's troubled post-colonial decades, Chad has been a particularly bad case. Since its formal independence from France in 1960, it has remained dependent on aid and pervasively corrupt, scourged by 40 years of almost uninterrupted civil war and repressive dictatorships. About 80 percent of Chadians survive by laboring to grow their own food, often in near desert conditions. Less than three in 10 can read and write. Even Ndjamena, the capital, has only a few paved roads and lacks regular electricity and reliable communications with the outside world. Citing Chad's endemic violence and corruption, human rights and development organizations pressed the World Bank to shun the pipeline, which is thought likely to generate $ 2 billion to $ 3 billion for the government over 25 years. These groups said the money would only escalate armed power struggles and be diverted by authoritarian rulers to buy guns or to fatten their bank accounts. To counter those fears, the World Bank demanded guarantees from Deby on how the oil revenue would be spent. In a press release after it approved the project, the bank called the agreement with Deby's government an ""unprecedented framework to transform oil wealth into direct benefits for the poor, the vulnerable and the environment."" Deby, a general who seized power in a coup in 1990, accepted two independent boards--one Chadian and the other a World Bank-supervised international body--to audit the spending of all oil revenue. He also agreed that 10 percent of the receipts would be put into a trust account abroad for future generations of citizens. Deby agreed further to put into law a commitment to spend 80 percent of the oil revenue on health, education, infrastructure and rural development programs--a step that would give Chad its first opportunity to modernize. In May, the government received its first revenue from the project, a $ 25 million bonus paid by the oil consortium's junior partners, San Francisco-based Chevron and Petronas of Malaysia. Deby publicly promised full disclosure on how the money would be spent even though the formal monitoring mechanisms were not yet in place. Then, according to government sources, diplomats and World Bank officials, the money began disappearing, just as one of the nation's endless rebellions in the northern Tibesti Mountains was heating up. Despite repeated inquiries from the World Bank and local advocacy groups, Deby did not disclose until last week that he had spent $ 4.5 million of the initial payment on weapons. ""It is patently obvious that without security there can be no development programs,"" Deby said in defending the purchases. He said the bank knew about the purchases and expressed no disapproval, a statement the World Bank vehemently denied. ""The Chadian government did not provide us with relevant information until after the fact,"" said Richard Uku, head of the bank's external affairs unit for Africa. To reassure the World Bank, the Chadian government has told bank officials that it has frozen spending of the rest of the money until the Oil Revenues Control and Monitoring Board begins functioning. It has also promised a full accounting of how it spent the first $ 15 million at a special session of parliament later this week. Ottaway reported from Washington."8-Dec-00,CHAD (94%); AFRICA (93%);,"THE NATION of Chad is war-torn, land-locked and destitute: Its average per capita income comes to just 55 cents daily. And yet, rather than help Chad fight illiteracy, high infant mortality rates or any of its other challenges, the international community may now have a duty to do the opposite. The government of President Idriss Deby has violated the terms of a huge oil development program concluded with the World Bank just six months ago. Unless Chad steps back into line quickly, it deserves neither the debt relief that it is due to apply for this month nor any further help in building its oil pipeline. Development aid understandably has critics. The money sent to poor countries with weak institutions sometimes gets wasted, or even goes to finance bad policies that deepen misery. The case for aid therefore depends on attaching conditions to it, and on being prepared to stop the flow of assistance when the conditions are not met. Just at the moment, for example, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund are arranging debt reduction for poor countries. But in order to qualify, the countries have to say how they will use the freed-up cash to reduce poverty. If donors did not require that commitment, debt relief might end up financing villas for presidential cronies. In Chad's case, the World Bank has devised an especially elaborate system of conditions, because it has backed an especially controversial project: a 650-mile oil pipeline, the biggest infrastructure development now underway in Africa, to connect Chad's oil fields to the Atlantic Ocean. The scheme was attacked by environmentalists, who feared harm to the rain forest, and by people who saw that past oil windfalls have done more to stoke corruption in poor countries than to promote development. The World Bank countered by setting up a special accounting system for the oil revenues and demanding that they be spent on education, health and other worthwhile causes. The bank even argued that this ""Chadian model"" would point the way to resource-led development in other poor countries. This seemed a fair bet six months ago, and we supported the project. But Mr. Deby has now diverted $ 4.5 million from the oil project to finance arms purchases, declaring that without security there can be no development. Even if you concede that Mr. Deby might need weapons to defend his government from rebels, there is no question that he violated the terms of the oil agreement. Unless Mr. Deby makes amends swiftly, it will be hard to justify further aid to him. This is a tough call: Cutting off aid would condemn Chad's people to continued poverty. But the World Bank has to accept that it can't battle illiteracy or infant mortality in countries whose rulers are not committed to those objectives. Financing arms purchases won't help Chad to escape poverty, and allowing Mr. Deby to violate donor conditions with impunity would damage the World Bank's ability to promote sound policies throughout the developing world."17-Dec-00,CHAD (97%); UNITED STATES (79%);,"A World Bank staff member complains that ""the Chadian government did not provide us with relevant information until after the fact,"" referring to the revelation that Chadian President Idriss Deby spent $ 4.5 million of a World Bank loan package for a new oil pipeline on weapons [news story, Dec. 5]. This is feigned ignorance. For years, citizens' groups, human rights advocates and environmental activists in Chad and around the world have been warning the bank that its loan package (worth more than $ 300 million) for this pipeline was likely to exacerbate the country's civil war and worsen an already-dismal human rights and corruption record. Even when presented with a Harvard Law School study that said Chad's government was unlikely to invest oil revenues in programs to help the poor, the World Bank insisted Chad could be trusted. In the days leading up to the bank's vote on whether to approve the project, reports from Chad indicated that military and administrative officials loyal to Mr. Deby went into villages in the oil-producing region and threatened to kill anyone who opposed the oil extraction. That the World Bank now expresses shock and dismay is hypocrisy. Oil drilling benefits big oil companies and corrupt officials but rarely the poor. It is time for the World Bank to wake up and stop wasting taxpayer money on such ill-conceived projects. CYNTHIA McKINNEY U.S. Representative (D-Ga.) Washington"24-Dec-00,ANGOLA (99%); UNITED STATES (93%); AFRICA (93%); EUROPE (79%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%); PORTUGAL (76%);,"The morning wind whistles through the bullet holes in the tiny house on Teofilo-Braga Street. The electricity is out again. And Agostinho Capitango shuffles through the dark, his wooden leg dragging, as he considers his rusting faucets. ""We used to take showers when there was water,"" he said. ""That was in 1992."" In the far-flung provincial capitals of America's eighth-largest oil supplier, history has seemingly reversed course, leaving entire communities with dimming memories of modernity. Here, wheelbarrows and bicycles wobble along avenues once clogged by automobiles. Street lights have been blinded by rifle fire. There is no running water, no postal service, no garbage collection and scant rehabilitation for a shattered town where collapsed roofs, missing walls and other scars from the continuing civil war disfigure nearly every building. Angola is vowing to rebuild its broken cities after decades of war, neglect and squandered riches. The government just recently allowed foreign auditors to begin their accounting of the country's oil revenues for the first time and renewed promises to increase spending on crumbling infrastructure, all in an effort to secure low-interest loans from the West. But the measures -- which have been praised by the State Department and the International Monetary Fund -- have only exposed the magnitude of the task ahead. This country may surpass Kuwait in oil exports by 2010, but it is still crippled by an inefficient and corrupt public service, decaying infrastructure and attacks by a weakened but unrepentant rebel army, say diplomats and local and United Nations officials. In November, the government decided to commemorate 25 years of independence from Portugal by pardoning rebel soldiers and pumping water to thousands of homes on Independence Day, Nov. 11. One month later, the rebel leadership rejected the olive branch. And Mr. Capitango's tap is still dry. Forty years have passed since sub-Saharan Africa began shaking off colonial rule to harness the continent's natural riches for its oppressed people. Today, one of every five Africans lives in a country severely disrupted by conflict. And the wealth that once enriched Europe's colonial powers now fuels many of those wars. The World Bank estimates that conflicts in Central and West Africa have cost those regions more than $1 billion and $800 million respectively. In Angola, where the continent's longest-running civil war simmers, the toll is achingly apparent in communities undone by violence, poverty and corruption even as oil exports boom. About a quarter of the country's 13 million people have been forced to flee their homes since war erupted after independence in 1975. The World Food Program, which issued an urgent appeal for donations this month, struggles to feed nearly a million people. And every day, about 500 children die from malnutrition, disease and exploding land mines. Leprosy and polio -- illnesses virtually eradicated in the West -- are rampant. Rebels and bandits roam freely through vast swaths of the country, making roads impassable. And since the national airline refuses to fly to most stretches of the interior, most Angolans are stranded in remote towns that seem like islands in dangerous waters. In a roofless, doorless warehouse of this isolated, destroyed city, a war-weary graffiti writer vents his people's frustration on the cement walls. ""Angola says, 'Enough!' "" he cried in his black scrawl. President Jose Eduardo dos Santos blames the continuing misery on the rebels, who have reneged on two peace agreements since 1990. But criticism of Mr. dos Santos is mounting as the United Nations, human rights groups and ordinary Angolans increasingly raise pointed questions about how the government is spending its wealth. Deeply indebted and desperate for low-interest loans, the government finally agreed this year to open its oil accounts to the I.M.F. and to redirect its oil revenues from defense toward rebuilding, a move that Human Rights Watch has described as ""a positive first step."" ""The government of the Republic of Angola recognizes that the present still remains marked by numberless difficulties,"" the government told the nation in an Independence Day communique. ""The government of unity and reconciliation is already implementing deep, wide-ranging reforms."" I.M.F. officials, who are still assessing Mr. dos Santos's commitment, say the government pledged $90 million for public repairs this year. There are reports of a new power station in Humpata, a repaired dam in Matala, running water in Huambo, new money for roads, hospitals and housing. But that message has yet to trickle down to the bureaucrats click-clacking on manual typewriters in dusty offices without electric lights. Salomao Canhanga, a 49-year-old administrator, works in the housing rehabilitation bureau, but he admits that there is no housing rehabilitation happening here. His friends and neighbors beg for help with the gaping holes left by falling mortar shells. Mr. Canhanga tells them the office has no money for repairs. Even he has to scavenge for wood planks and straw mats to replace the glass windows in his house that were shattered by rebel attacks seven years ago. As for sanitation? He shrugs his shoulders. ""Those workers don't have cars,"" Mr. Canhanga said gloomily. ""We don't have trash cans. We have nothing, nothing."" Mr. Canhanga earns about $16 a month and grows vegetables to feed his family. His youngest son, born in 1994, has only fuzzy memories of glass windows or houses without bullet holes. And these days, some of Mr. Canhanga's colleagues look back on their Portuguese oppressors with nostalgia. ""There's a feeling of sadness,"" Mr. Canhanga admitted. ""People see independence as suffering. That's how they understand it. Some people say, 'When is this independence going to end?' "" Underpaid and undersupplied, provincial bureaucrats have abdicated most responsibilities to foreign charities. The World Food Program repairs classrooms and feeds nearly half of the town's 220,000 people. Oxfam builds water pumps. Doctors Without Borders provides supplies and medicines at the local hospital; it says the government covers only about 1 percent of the operating costs. The government is technically responsible for the town generator, the water supply, the roads, defense and administration. But when officials tried to restore water on Independence Day, the underground pipes were so corroded that most people ended up without even a drop. In its most recent report, the I.M.F. estimates that 40 percent of government spending went for defense in 1999, compared with 5 percent for social issues like health and education. Human rights groups say corrupt officials have siphoned off millions, a charge the government denies. What is clear, however, is that the government is still unprepared to rescue this graceful colonial city once known for its gardens, its fountains and its rich soil. In the vast camps for displaced people, babies with polio creep on hopelessly deformed limbs. In the dingy hospital, a teenager with leprosy screams as a nurse disinfects his diseased flesh. A young soldier with empty eyes lies motionless as his amputated leg bleeds steadily into a blue bucket. But they, at least, are alive. In the fiercest fighting here in 1993 and 1994, 30,000 people were killed in street battles that spilled out from Avenida Joaquim Kapango. So many died in the hail of falling mortars and machine-gun fire that bodies were buried where they fell, in alleys, parks, backyards, basements. But in a town where thousands are hungry and homeless, the dead are no longer sacred. Grave robbers chip away at the walls of the municipal cemetery. They plunder coffins and drag away precious headstones. ""People used to respect the dead,"" said Francisco Cavamba, 60, a grizzled man who has been burying bodies for 30 years. ""These days, people need bricks and stones to rebuild houses."" Building supplies are flown in on cargo planes at exorbitant prices. That means there are too few bricks on the market, said Mr. Cavamba, staring at the rows of desecrated graves. ""And there are so many, so many dead."" People are still dying. At first, the fighting was fueled by the cold war. The Russians and Cubans backed Mr. dos Santos and his Marxist party, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola. The United States and the apartheid rulers of South Africa supported the rebels, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, known as Unita, led by Jonas Savimbi. When the cold war ended, Mr. Savimbi sold the country's abundant diamonds to equip his army. He returned to war in 1998, but government soldiers armed with the profits of oil sales destroyed much of his war machine last year. Mr. dos Santos has trumpeted the military successes, saying the rebels no longer threaten the government's efforts to rebuild. But recently a bomb exploded outside the police station here, relief workers said. And in the last few months, 40,000 people have poured into the town, fleeing guerrilla attacks and skirmishes between the two sides in nearby villages. In an assessment in November, the United Nations reported that rebel attacks on civilians, banditry and exploding land mines continue to disrupt the country. In some cases, the report says, government soldiers and the police are implicated in the robberies, rapes and forcible relocations of the very people they are supposed to protect. ""It should be noted that while the government claims to have control of over 90 percent of the country, the control that the government exercises does not infer normality,"" the United Nations said in its report. Next year, Angola hopes to export as much as one million barrels of oil a day. And some critics believe that Mr. dos Santos is playing down the country's problems to reduce pressure on the government to invest more in the beleaguered provinces. Hendrik Vaal Neto, the minister of communications, denies such charges. He says the government had no choice in the past but to spend its oil money on weapons. But with the war ebbing, he says the government is moving rapidly to rebuild. ""There has been a lot of suffering since 1975, but right now we are in a better position to solve our people's problems,"" Mr. Neto said in an interview earlier this year. ""There are already many positive changes,"" he said. ""Some people do not want to recognize that. If you give the government two or three years, you will see the government directing even more finances to social problems."" When there is electricity, Mr. Capitango hears those promises revived on the grainy newscasts on his black-and-white television. And most mornings, he pedals his black bicycle to church and asks God to help the government keep its word. ""My father, he encouraged me to believe,"" said Mr. Capitango, 51, his brown eyes wistful with the memory of it, as he invited a stranger into his dim parlor on another afternoon without power. ""He told me there were many wars in the past and that things would change,"" he said. ""The world wars ended. This, too, would end. But my father, he was captured and killed by Unita. ""Now, I talk to my children,"" said Mr. Capitango, sighing. ""I tell them one day the war will finish. But the situation is worse all the time. And I am getting old.""  http://www.nytimes.com Map of Angola highlights Kuito: In Kuito, a broken provincial capital, modernity is just a memory. (pg. 8)"4-Jan-01,CHAD (95%); CAMEROON (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); EUROPE (79%); AFRICA (79%),"-- Konhodjingar Dolbe, chief of this mud-and-thatch hamlet, sat under a giant mango tree surrounded by village elders as he pondered what the pumping of oil might bring his dirt-poor people. ""It could mean a lot, because we could do a lot with the money,"" Dolbe said, sipping strong, sweet tea and chewing on bits of meat. ""But we don't know what the future holds. There is no information regarding the pipeline or the money we will get. We support it if it benefits us. If not, we don't."" Dolbe is not alone in his ignorance. Despite the bitter international controversy that has surrounded a $ 3.7 billion oil project over the past three years, many of the villagers who will be most directly affected by the project know little about it. The essential aspects of the project -- the pipeline's route, safeguards against environmental damage and how the revenue it generates will be dispensed -- were worked out in faraway Washington and European capitals. And the result was shaped more by foreign and Chadian nongovernmental organizations, or NGOs, than by Chad's authoritarian government or the peasants of this isolated area. The NGOs -- human rights monitors, environmental watchdogs, development groups and similar organizations -- played a pivotal role in determining the final form of the mammoth oil pipeline undertaking. The project offers an example of the influence of NGOs that is perhaps unprecedented in a private-sector endeavor of such magnitude -- while at the same time illustrating how NGOs operating at the global level and those based in towns and villages throughout the Third World often see issues in starkly different terms. The venture, which became public knowledge in 1996, is the largest infrastructure project underway in Africa today. It is designed to extract 1 billion barrels of crude oil over 30 years here in southwestern Chad and pipe it across neighboring Cameroon to the Atlantic coast, 650 miles away. For three years, until the day in October when construction began, NGOs set the agenda -- first opposing the pipeline, then using their influence to establish principles for oil companies operating in developing countries. NGO demands even determined the level of compensation for any mango trees that villagers living along the pipeline's path may lose, while leaving the Chadian government little room for diversion of cash or other corrupt practices. In Ndjamena, Chad's capital, a 12-hour drive from here along the only road, oil company officials readily attest to the impact NGOs are having on their business. ""We call NGOs the fifth branch of government here,"" said one oil company official. ""That is how much influence they have gained. I have never seen anything like it."" As influential as the NGOs proved to be, the pipeline project nevertheless highlighted the divide between such organizations based in industrialized countries of the Northern Hemisphere and those working in developing nations to the south. In the case of the pipeline, groups in the United States and Europe first sought to derail the project over environmental and human rights concerns; their counterparts in the region saw hope that the pipeline might improve the lot of the impoverished people with whom they work. The chasm was bridged and a compromise reached. But how big-issue groups will cooperate with grass-roots groups in the future remains to be seen, and critics within the World Bank, oil companies and academia are starting to challenge the claims of NGOs to represent with moral certainty the interests of voiceless majorities in developing countries. Largely an empty land, Chad is the world's fifth-poorest country, according to U.N. figures. Eighty percent of its 7 million people live on less than $ 1 a day. The existence of considerable deposits of oil -- the country's only known mineral resource -- has been known for 30 years. But little was done about it until 1993, when Exxon -- now Exxon Mobil, the world's biggest private oil company -- became interested in spending the billions of dollars necessary to exploit the black gold. From the outset, there were persistent doubts about whether the project would go forward because of its high cost and complexity. Exxon's original two European partners dropped out suddenly last year, and only in May did the American giant find two others, Chevron of the United States and Petronas of Malaysia, to help share the risks and cost. Exxon kept the project wrapped in secrecy. Environmental NGOs based in Washington learned only in 1996 that it was going forward. The following year, they launched an international campaign to kill the project, focusing their energies on the World Bank, which was considering requests from Exxon, as well as Chad and Cameroon, for financial and political support. Korinna Horta, senior economist at the nonprofit group Environmental Defense, put together the first detailed analysis -- and broad indictment -- of the project in February 1997, claiming it was sure to result in ""environmental devastation and brutal human rights violations."" Organizations such as hers and the Bank Information Center, the Sierra Club and the Center for International Environmental Law made use of their Washington offices to extract closely held studies about the project from the World Bank and U.S. government agencies. They then relayed the information to their counterparts here in Chad and in Cameroon. NGO leaders here say that had it not been for the activists in Washington, the pipeline plan probably would never have been revealed before the start of construction, because Chad's strong-arm leader, Idriss Deby, had sought to avoid public scrutiny of other large projects. Exxon, however, said that as early as 1993 it had begun ""one of the most extensive consultation efforts ever undertaken in Africa,"" which included holding 900 village-level public meetings in Chad and Cameroon to explain the project. At first, NGOs in Washington and European capitals wanted the project halted altogether. But they discovered that Chadians generally viewed the project, with its promise of jobs and a huge jump in public revenue, as the chance of a lifetime to move out of abject poverty. ""When we came in, we came in too forcefully, too directly,"" said a European NGO worker here. ""We were saying 'Stop the pipeline' in the name of the people, and the people were saying, 'Maybe we can have a better life. We want the pipeline.' So we had to step back and rethink our approach."" The issues surrounding the project showed northern and southern NGOs that they had markedly different priorities. Those based in Washington and European capitals focused on environmental issues, such as the potential damage of the pipeline to rain forests in Cameroon and possible oil spills on precious aquifers in Chad, or on human rights abuses. But these proved to be secondary to most Chadians, and local activists have had to bend to grass-roots pressures here. Because the oil revenue for Chad is projected to be at least $ 2.5 billion over 30 years -- enough to allow the government to double its spending -- NGOs have turned their efforts to ensuring that the revenue is used to help the entire country and not siphoned off to the private bank accounts of senior government officials. One Chadian human rights activist who sought to bridge the north-south NGO gap was Delphine K. Djiraibe, president of the Chadian Association for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights and currently a fellow at the Center for International Environmental Law in Washington. ""At the very beginning, we were all lobbying to stop the pipeline,"" Djiraibe said. ""I am still against the pipeline completely. But everyone kept saying, 'Try it; maybe it will help us,' so we had to look for ways to make the project better, not kill it."" The NGOs came up with a set of demands that they felt should be met before the project could go ahead, demands that easily could have killed the project in its infancy. These included a two-year moratorium on any decision by the World Bank and numerous local conditions -- among them, establishment of a democratic government in Chad; an end to corruption in Cameroon; an "8-Jan-01,GHANA (94%); WESTERN AFRICA (93%); AFRICA (93%); SENEGAL (92%); SIERRA LEONE (79%); COTE D'IVOIRE (79%); LIBERIA (79%); GUINEA (79%); NIGERIA (79%),"In its first two decades of independence, the West African nation of Ghana was an archetypal political disaster, brought low by successive coups and dictatorships, corruption and near total economic collapse. Today, Ghana is a welcome African example of legitimate democracy and successful economic reform. In an unusually peaceful transfer of power, a civilian government that grew out of a military regime has accepted an election defeat and surrendered power to the opposition. John Kufuor, an Oxford-trained lawyer and businessman, and the leader of Ghana's opposition New Patriotic Party, was sworn in as president yesterday. He defeated John Atta Mills, the incumbent vice president, in an election widely viewed as free and fair. President Jerry Rawlings, the charismatic former flight lieutenant who has dominated Ghana for nearly 20 years, stepped down after reaching a constitutional two-term limit as elected president. Few would have predicted this turn of events when Mr. Rawlings seized power in a coup in 1981. At the time Ghana was a wreck and millions of people had left the country in search of work. In the two decades since, in close cooperation with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Ghana emerged as a model for free-market innovations in Africa, and now spends five times as much on education and health as on its military. Ghana still faces formidable challenges -- continued corruption, low prices for its main exports, cocoa and gold, and high prices for imported oil. Moreover, Ghana is located in the heart of one of Africa's least stable regions, with nearby Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea consumed by war and smuggling and Ivory Coast in decline. Mr. Rawlings is not the only West African leader to surrender power in the past year. In Senegal last March, President Abdou Diouf, who had held power for 20 years, graciously bowed out after losing an election to the opposition leader Abdoulaye Wade.  Together these two countries have shown that not all the news of Africa need be bad. The key to success in Ghana has been creative and enlightened cooperation between international lenders and local officials, combined with Mr. Rawlings's shrewd effort to tame the military and redirect it away from politics. Nigeria, the region's powerhouse, which is now making its own difficult transition from military rule to democracy, can learn from Ghana's achievement. Mr. Kufuor has said he will introduce a South African-style truth commission to investigate Ghana's violent political past. There are risks in probing deeply into past political crimes. But some form of public accounting for the criminal abuse of power can be a deterrent to future crimes, and thus a source of stability."28-Feb-01,COTE D'IVOIRE (97%); UNITED STATES (96%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (72%),"-- The United States today strongly condemned human rights abuses in this once peaceful and prosperous nation, saying the civilian government of President Laurent Gbagbo had done little to rein in human rights violations by state security forces that were rampant under the military regime it replaced. U.S. Ambassador George Mu, in an unusual news conference to discuss the State Department's annual human rights report, said the United States was concerned about Ivory Coast's human rights situation, ""which has deteriorated steadily and appears to us to be continuing with no end in sight."" Mu said state security forces were committing rights violations with impunity. He mentioned extrajudicial killings, arbitrary and illegal detentions, torture, extortion, and harassment of foreigners, who make up almost a third of the population. Gbagbo, the country's elected leader, has failed to halt the abuses by security forces, especially the paramilitary gendarmerie, according to the U.S. report, as well as recent reports by Human Rights Watch and the Ivorian Human Rights League. Until recently, this West African nation was widely regarded as a model of economic stability and racial harmony and had largely escaped the worst of the widespread malfeasance common to its neighbors. But Ivory Coast has suffered a steady decline over the past 18 months. The military seized power in December 1999, anti-foreigner sentiment has grown, and repeated coup attempts and continuing political instability have led scores of businesses to shut down or relocate. Harassment of businessmen and extortion rackets run by security forces, coupled with the growing number of police roadblocks where bribes are constantly demanded, also have driven businesses away. Government spokesmen did not return telephone calls seeking comment. But on Monday, the government, after a long cabinet meeting, said it was creating an elite police group to crack down on extortion, political violence and unlawful roadblocks. The European Union, United States and such international lending agencies as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have all made improving the human rights situation a condition of renewing aid, which was suspended after the 1999 coup. This message was hammered home to Prime Minister Affi N'Guessan during a recent visit to Europe and will be reinforced during his visit this week to the United States to meet officials of the Bush administration and international lending agencies, according to diplomatic sources. Gbagbo took power following elections last October in which most major candidates were banned from participating by the ruling military, led by Gen. Robert Guei. Gbagbo, a longtime socialist opposition leader, defeated Guei in the voting and called his followers into the street to drive the military out when Guei refused to step down. Gbagbo was aided by the gendarmerie. Hundreds of people were killed in the October street fighting. A Human Rights Watch briefing paper released in December said there was ""overwhelming evidence of state-sponsored human rights violations, with a clear ethnic and religious focus"" in the October violence. Muslims and supporters of the opposition Rally of Republicans -- a party based in the mostly Muslim northern region -- bore the brunt of the attacks, Human Rights Watch said. Many more died during political violence in December that was sparked by Gbagbo's decision to ban a leading Rally of Republicans candidate from legislative elections. The State Department report, along with other human rights reports, noted that, despite the government's pledge to investigate a massacre in October of 57 people, mostly young Muslim men, no results of any investigation have been issued and no one has been punished. The State Department report said security forces ""regularly beat"" those detained, forced them to drink urine or blood and eat excrement."4-May-01,GHANA (97%); UNITED STATES (93%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%),"The good news from Ghana, the West African state from which so many black Americans trace their roots, is that after decades of political mismanagement it is finally following the first rule of holes. The first rule of holes states: ""When you're in a hole, stop digging."" Having had its first-ever peaceful, democratic transition from one elected government to another last December, Ghana's new president, J. A. Kufuor, has a clear mandate to stop digging. Mr. Kufuor was elected by a solid majority by calling for improved governance, an end to official corruption and a renewed effort to expand trade and attract foreign investment. That's the good news. The bad news is: The hole Ghana has dug itself into is really, really deep. Half of Ghana's government budget goes to pay just the interest on its domestic and foreign debts, accumulated over years of idiotic African Socialism, plunder by leaders and weak governance, compounded by poor oversight by the I.M.F. and World Bank. ""The problem for us,"" President Kufuor said in an interview at his home, ""is that you feel like you're in a hole, and you want to get out, and you hear all these noises and all this activity coming from the top of the hole. It leaves you feeling that everyone up there is busy and active and you feel very much alone. I want to feel that there is someone out there with some humanism to stretch back to me and help me out."" What is encouraging about Ghana is that the impulse for reform here was driven by the people below, not just the pols above. What worries Ghanaians, though, is that after so many years in the third world they may not be able to compete in the Fast World. I gave a talk at the University of Ghana, and afterward one student asked me: ""Will the world have empathy for us?"" -- as Ghana tries to go down this new path. ""No,"" I said, ""the world will have no empathy for you, but that's not what you want anyway! You want to appeal to greed. You want to create a sense of opportunity here that will attract wealthy Ghanaians to bring their money back home and create jobs. You want investment, not pity."" The dependency culture here is so deep, though, this logic is very new. Then another student asked: If it's true that in the age of globalization the big don't eat the small but the fast will eat the slow, what is Ghana to do? ""We're naturally slow here,"" he said. ""We eat slow. We talk slow. We sing slow. We like things slow. How will we compete in this world?"" Direction is more important than speed, I argued. Ghana has been on the wrong road for so long its per-capita income is now $1 a day. It needs to get on the right road and go at any pace it can. Ghana is rich in human and natural resources. What it has lacked are good fundamentals: institutions, decent schools and legal frameworks to get the most out of those resources. The secret for success in globalization is all about building good fundamentals -- not modems or bandwidth. ""The lack of good governance is the bane of Africa,"" said Papa Owusu-Ankomah, deputy majority leader of the Ghanaian Parliament. ""Without strong institutions we can't check abuses of power, and that has been the source of all our problems."" But generating institutions is not easy. Historically there are two ways: One is the way America got them -- through evolution: 200 years of slowly evolving the habits and laws to govern a modern society. The other way is how India or postwar Germany and Japan got them -- through imperialism: someone comes from abroad and imposes democratic structures until they take root. The problem for Ghana, and the rest of Africa, is that it is too early for evolution -- that takes decades -- and it is too late for imperialism. It will have to find the energy from within. Mr. Kufuor's election signals that Ghanaians want to try. Mr. Kufuor says he intends to try. The Bush team should go out of its way to help Ghana -- now -- with conditional aid. That is, aid, and debt relief, tied to the building of real institutions. The dawns are always spectacular on the vast African continent, but false dawns abound here as well. Just look at Nigeria and South Africa, whose democratically elected leaders are slowly sinking away. Ghana now offers the best chance to establish an African model for free-market democracy. Here comes the sun. Let's hope it's really rising, and if it is, let's do our part to keep it up there."13-May-01,EQUATORIAL GUINEA (99%); AFRICA (95%); CAMEROON (92%); ANGOLA (92%); NIGERIA (92%); SIERRA LEONE (79%); BOTSWANA (79%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%),"From the ramshackle wooden airport building in a clearing carved out of the jungle, down the main street with its scattering of new stoplights, to the presidential compound with its Moroccan bodyguards, there is little to suggest that this is the capital of one of Africa's richest nations. That could soon change. Oil is surging from new fields and profits are beginning to flow. For the first time in its brutal history, Equatorial Guinea, a former Spanish colony of 475,000 people that for decades has been one of Africa's most isolated and impoverished countries, has a chance at prosperity and integration into the world economy. The oil boom -- Equatorial Guinea is now the third-largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa behind giants Nigeria and Angola -- has given the country a moment of opportunity that African nations rarely encounter and have historically squandered: the possibility of turning a bonanza in natural resources into an antidote for poverty and an incentive for building democracy and civil society. So far, the signs in Equatorial Guinea are not encouraging. Although glass-fronted bank buildings are rising in Malabo -- and cell phones, sport-utility vehicles, mansions and other signs of wealth and status have become commonplace nearly overnight -- many diplomats, oil executives and analysts here see few indications that the country is breaking with its history of corrupt, repressive one-family rule and economic stagnation. ""Equatorial Guinea is at a crossroads: They will either blow it spectacularly, or they could succeed,"" said a U.S. official. ""But so far there is little evidence they will succeed or that the wealth will be devoted to public good."" Natural riches have often proved to be more of a curse than a blessing for African nations. On one hand, the relative prosperity of countries such as South Africa and Botswana can be traced directly to mineral riches. On the other, diamonds are fueling wars in Sierra Leone, Congo and Angola. And throughout the 1980s and '90s, oil money fed such a degree of corruption and brutality in Nigeria under military dictators that the bankrupt state almost collapsed. Now, in Equatorial Guinea, ""petroleum revenues have given one of the poorest countries in the world an opportunity to give its people development,"" said Robert Lacey, World Bank country representative for Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon. ""But in order to do that, it is absolutely essential to ensure the oil money is used in a transparent, open way for development."" Equatorial Guinea, which sits partly on the African mainland and partly on an island off the coast of Cameroon, is pumping 210,000 barrels of oil a day. Production is expected to climb 20 percent by next year and could reach a barrel a day for each of the 475,000 citizens within three years, oil industry sources said. Already about $ 5 billion has poured in from American investors, according to U.S. government figures, ranking Equatorial Guinea behind only South Africa, Nigeria and Angola in sub-Saharan Africa. But even with economic growth averaging more than 20 percent a year for the past three years and per capita income jumping from $ 390 in 1995 to $ 1,170 today, according to African Development Bank figures, the new wealth has not trickled down very far. ""So far I can only say I have seen no change in my life,"" said Antonio Abogo, driving his battered taxi near his home in the slum of Newbuil -- short for ""new building."" ""We hear there is oil money, we see foreigners coming with money,"" Abogo said, ""but we don't get to touch the money. Not yet. Maybe never."" Used during colonial times to work the area's rich cocoa fields, most inhabitants of Equatorial Guinea have known only abject poverty and rapacious exploitation for centuries. Following independence from Spain in 1968, the country's first president, Francisco Macias, proclaimed himself God's ""unique miracle."" His country, however, became known as ""Africa's concentration camp."" Macias ran the economy into the ground, cut off most relations with the outside world and executed or drove into exile more than a third of the population. In 1979, he was overthrown and executed by Teodoro Obiang Nguema, his nephew, security chief and right-hand man. Obiang ruled for 17 years before submitting to elections, and captured 98 percent of the vote in 1996 balloting that the U.S. State Department said was ""marred by extensive fraud and intimidation."" Obiang and his Mongomo clan of the Fang ethnic group still exercise an almost absolute grip on power. His brother is the head of the nation's security forces and controls the election board. One son is the minister of forestry, while another is the key contact with oil companies at the Ministry of Mines and Energy. A nephew is national treasurer, and at least five of the nation's eight generals are close relatives. But Obiang, fearful of palace intrigues, entrusts his personal security only to Moroccan guards. Oil was discovered here in 1996, but until this year, government officials, oil executives and diplomats said, most of the revenue went to oil companies to recover investment costs. What little went to the government was spent on foreign debt and efforts to rebuild a decaying infrastructure. This will be the first year in which the government reaps large gains from oil. Oil revenue is projected to rise from $ 140 million to about $ 185 million; in 1999, the total government budget was $ 47 million. Obiang, in a May 1 speech, promised the money would be used to eradicate poverty and improve education and health. He said he had already ordered the minimum wage for oil workers to be doubled. ""From this year forward, things will be changing,"" Obiang said. ""These are the good years. We must not waste them."" But diplomats, opposition politicians and aid workers say the government is unwilling to account for oil revenue or present a plan to use the money. ""The president has dictatorial powers and is not controlled by laws or the constitution,"" said Placido Mico Abogo, the best-known opposition leader, who has been jailed several times. ""What we are seeing now is the true pillaging of our country. What they are leaving us are the crumbs."" For example, until last month, government officials and oil company executives said, oil companies could hire only members of Obiang's Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea. Largely because of the shortage of qualified workers, the restriction was lifted at the oil companies' request. At the rundown airport, oil money has paid for a new glass presidential wing, which sits away from the dark, dingy main terminal and can be used only by Obiang and the ruling elite. The government recently announced that it will provide new SUVs for the 79 Obiang supporters in the 80-seat Legislative Assembly. Outside the capital, Equatorial Guinea -- which is a little smaller than Maryland -- has less than 40 miles of paved roads. Many people live on abandoned and overgrown cocoa plantations, surviving mostly on bush meat, bananas and a few subsistence crops. ""I have heard of oil,"" said a vendor at a roadside stand with several wild rats, a dietary staple here, tied on a rack. ""But I don't really know what it is. It means nothing to me."" Still, there are some signs of change. On the political front, diplomats and opposition leaders said, Obiang has eased harassment of the opposition and the systematic use of torture, although serious abuses continue. ""The government is not using the more brutal methods now, but the structure and rapaciousness of the regime have not changed,"" said a longtime diplomat here. ""This country is the personal property of the president and his family. But at the same time, there are some important gestures being made."" For example, he said, opposition leader Mico is no longer in hiding, and his party was allowed to hold a convention in February. Eleven people accused of plotting a coup in 1998 were pardoned this year -- a far cry from the days of Macias, who on Christmas 1975 executed 150 alleged coup plotters in the national stadium while a band played ""Those Were the Days."" In addition, at least some of country's physical infrastructure is being rebuilt -- but not without problems. CMS Energy, a major partner in the new $ 420 million gas plant here, installed a new electrical generator that gave the capital its first reliable energy source in decades. However, because the rest of the power grid is decrepit, blackouts are still common. The 32-mile road from the capital to Luba -- the only other town on the island part of the nation -- was supposed to be repaved to facilitate commerce, and oil companies are building a new port there. But for reasons no one could explain, the new road goes only 20 miles, then reverts to the rutted and pocked track that was there before. ""Look, we can't even finish the one road on the island,"" a local businessman said. ""The money simply disappeared for the last bit. That tells you everything about how things will go."""20-May-01,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (90%); AFRICA (78%)","Living on the Brink of Disaster in Mobutu's Congo By Michela Wrong HarperCollins. 338 pp. $ 26 The British journalist Michela Wrong takes the title of this chillingly amusing cautionary tale from Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, near the end of which the dying white station manager, Mr. Kurtz, cries out against ""the horror, the horror."" It is, as Wrong says, ""one of the great misquotations of all time,"" commonly misinterpreted as a protest against black Africa's ""supposed predisposition to violence."" Wrong gets it right: ""When Kurtz raves against 'the horror, the horror,' he is . . . registering in a final lucid moment just how far he has fallen from grace. The 'darkness' of the book's title refers to the monstrous passions at the core of the human soul, lying ready to emerge when man's better instincts are suspended. . . . Conrad was more preoccupied with rotten Western values, the white man's inhumanity to the black man, than, as is almost always assumed today, black savagery."" Wrong uses Conrad's theme in her study of the calamitous three-decade reign of Mobutu Sese Seko in Congo -- which Mobutu renamed Zaire -- to say that ""no man is a caricature, no individual can alone bear responsibility for a nation's collapse."" What happened in Zaire ""had its roots in a history of extraordinary outside interference, as basic in motivation as it was elevated in rhetoric."" She is wholly unsentimental about Mobutu, whom she calls ""brutal, ruthless and greedy,"" a ""neighborhood thug,"" but she also insists that ""if Mobutu traced a Kurtz-like trajectory from high ideals to febrile corruption, he did not pursue that itinerary alone, or unaided."" The story of Congo between Mobutu's rise to power in 1965 and his involuntary departure 32 years later is at once simple and familiar, yet unimaginably complicated, ambiguous and mysterious. On the one hand, it is a tale of a charming, stylish, intelligent, manipulative man who rose from unlikely origins, gained control of his government by unscrupulous means and bled its treasury dry; it is a tale that has been told many times, in many settings and with many casts of characters, and it gets no prettier with each retelling. On the other hand, it is a hugely intricate tapestry in which past and present are woven together in patterns that sometimes prove impenetrable; a tale involving so many people, organizations and acronyms that sheer bewilderment is the only honest way to respond; and a tale upon which it is impossible, in most respects if not all, to pronounce final and confident moral judgment. The legacy of Mobutu and his accomplices is stunning: ""Congo's economy has shrunk to the level of 1958, while the population has tripled. Average life expectancy is fifty-two, 80 per cent of the population is employed in 'subsistence activities'; illiteracy is growing; AIDS is rife and such diseases as bubonic plague and sleeping sickness are enjoying a vibrant comeback. By the end of the century the government's annual operating budget for what is potentially one of Africa's richest states was dipping below the daily takings of the US superstore Wal-Mart."" There are many reasons, but it all comes down to this: Mobutu stole Congo blind. Almost as soon as Mobutu took office, Wrong says, he devised the formula that would keep him in power for more than three decades: ""Why kill your enemies . . . when, with a bit of financial encouragement, they would willingly sell their souls?"" Mobutu had his sybaritic side and indulged it lavishly at public expense, ""but money was always a method, an instrument, the most effective of the techniques available when it came to maintaining, extending and preserving his power."" He ran ""a clientilist system that gobbled cash,"" to be blown on bribes and ""gifts"" and makework bureaucratic jobs and luxury automobiles and military hardware. His son, Nzanga, told Wrong: ""He never had the soul of a racketeer. For him money was simply a means to an end, a way of getting what he wanted."" The Mobutu government was a kleptocracy. As real money was gobbled up by Mobutu and his insiders, paper money was printed to keep the cash cow milkable. Inflation, ""which had reached double-digit figures sufficient in themselves to bring down an accountable Western government, suddenly rocketed in 1991 to a mind-boggling 4,130 per cent. . . . and in 1994 came the worst of the worst: inflation ballooned to 9,800 per cent."" The ""system was indeed imploding under the weight of its own eccentricities,"" and by the early 1990s things had gotten so out of hand that rebellion was inevitable. It came in October 1996, with the formation of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire; ""first Rwanda, then Uganda and finally Angola were eventually to join forces with the AFDL in a momentary coalition of regional interests never before witnessed in Africa,"" turning Zaire into ""the terrain on which alien forces worked out ancient grudges, with the locals swept along for the ride."" Mobutu -- who by then was dying of prostate cancer -- was sent into exile with surpassing swiftness, and Laurent Kabila installed in his stead: ""Despite [Mobutu's] departure, there has been no renewal, no change in mentalities. Mobutu ruled thanks to the support of a mono-ethnic security force. So does Kabila. Mobutu plundered the central bank. So does Kabila. Mobutu destroyed the formal economy. Kabila has gone even further, choking off the informal economy. 'Kabila,' as one European politician astutely remarked, 'has simply replaced Mobutu with Mobutuism.' "" Though Mobutu, Kabila and Co. must not in any way be permitted to shrug off the blame for their acts, Wrong correctly places them in the larger context of King Leopold of Belgium, who in the mid-1880s acquired as his very own colony the 905,000-square-mile Congo, which he called ""this magnificent African cake"" and to which he gave the name of Congo Free State. It was a deplorable euphemism. Congo under Leopold's rule ""was an exploitative system premised on forced labor, terror and repression,"" in which Leopold's agents tortured and murdered African natives in order to bend their labor to the king's commercial ambitions. As Wrong sees it, the parallel between Mobutu and Leopold is even stronger than that between Mobutu and Kabila: ""The two men shared more than just a knack for large-scale extortion and lavish spending tastes. Indeed, in money matters, the present echoes the past to an almost uncanny extent. Both leaders were to prove remarkably adept at squeezing loans out of gullible creditors and luring private investors with a taste for adventure to Africa. Both covered their tracks with a system of fraudulent book-keeping. Both indulged in similar stratagems in an attempt to cheat the taxman after their deaths and both, having feathered their own nests, left Congo with a heavy burden of debts to be settled after they quit the scene."" Belgium and its king were scarcely the only ones to exploit Congo for their own gain. France and the United States used it as a tool of Western interests during the Cold War -- the CIA, needless to say, had its hands into just about everything -- and then, once the Cold War ended, abandoned it with scarcely a backward glance. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund played their own questionable roles. ""Instead of the roller-coaster of war, destruction and eventual rebirth,"" Wrong writes, ""the intervention of the US, France and Belgium, of the World Bank and IMF, locked the society into one slow-motion economic collapse. Balked of expression, unable to advance, mindsets froze over sometime in the 1960s, leaving the country's leadership at the turn of the century stuck in an ideological time-warp."" The prospects of awakening it to reality any time soon are not exactly bright. * Jonathan Yardley's e-mail address is yardley@twp.com."27-May-01,KENYA (96%); ZIMBABWE (94%); AFRICA (94%); UNITED STATES (92%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%),"Secretary of State Colin L. Powell met today with Kenya's longtime president, Daniel arap Moi, and urged him to step aside and let a new president be elected next year. That repeated a message General Powell had sent to the president of Zimbabwe earlier on his African tour. General Powell called on Mr. Moi to push through an anti-corruption law in order to re-establish ties with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund; the organizations cut off loans to Kenya four years ago. But Mr. Moi left American officials guessing about his political intentions. Kenyan law calls for elections to be held by December 2002, and Mr. Moi, who is 76 years old and has been in office since 1978, is barred from re-election. Some of his supporters have urged him to change the system and run again, but General Powell suggested he could leave a positive legacy by stepping aside and allowing a new generation to guide the country. After meeting with General Powell today, Mr. Moi spoke cryptically outside the statehouse about General Powell's call for free elections and new leadership. ""I think it is too much always trying to undermine the intelligence of the African people,"" Mr. Moi said dismissively. ""Those who will determine the destiny of Kenya or other countries are the people themselves."" In a speech at a university in Johannesburg the day before, General Powell voiced his belief that some African leaders had clung to power too long. He cited President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, who has headed that country as either president or prime minister for more than two decades. Kenya has been ruled by the Kenya African National Union since its independence from Britain in 1963 and has become in effect a one-party state. Opposition parties are splintered among the country's many tribal groups, and Mr. Moi has used strong-arm tactics to keep rivals at bay. Tribal rivalries have long been an unsettling factor in Kenya's formation as an independent country. General Powell made a point today of meeting with opposition lawmakers such as Mwai Kibaki, a former vice president to Mr. Moi, who has since formed the rival Democratic Party and is regarded as a leading opposition candidate for president. General Powell was also joined in a discussion by Raila Odinga, son of another former vice president, Oginga Odinga. Raila Odinga had been jailed by Mr. Moi for allegedly organizing an opposition movement to topple the government. Some of Mr. Moi's allies have been keeping alive the idea of a another Moi term, leading to much speculation that the president, the son of a herdsman, will cling to the post. Despite his grip on power, Mr. Moi's official biography portrays him as a reluctant stateman who merely filled a leadership void and rebuffed plotters in 1992 who have tried to interrupt his elected leadership. ""Though moves to frustrate and destroy his political career were plotted, he calmly resisted and humbled himself, forgiving those who were after his neck as he assumed power,"" his biography says. A group of Kenyans also sought to press General Powell during his stay here for more compensation for victims of the 1998 bombing of the American Embassy here, which left 224 Kenyans dead and thousands injured. General Powell placed a wreath at a memorial for victims today but he declined to discuss the matter, saying there were lawsuits pending.

Since then, plainclothes government agents shadowed the former candidate's house and tailed his car. When Besigye boarded a flight abroad, ""internal security"" dragged him off the plane. In the central African country so often celebrated for breaking the mold of ""big man"" rule, the life of the opposition politician was settling into a trough all too familiar on a continent where lip service to democracy tends to exceed its practice. The usual scenario appeared to be holding true when Besigye emerged in suburban Washington last month. Besigye said he escaped Uganda in secret, just hours ahead of arrest and ""possible physical harm."" By long African custom, Besigye's next move would be ""back to the bush,"" the announcement of a guerrilla movement to unseat President Yoweri Museveni, who came to power 15 years ago by just such a war. Instead, Besigye said he will hit Museveni where he lives, by taking aim at foreign aid. ""The budget of Uganda is still more than 50 percent from the Western donors,"" Besigye said in a telephone interview from suburban Virginia. ""The money he's using to commit this oppression is coming from U.S. taxpayers. ""I am here to tell people in the administration that Uganda, contrary to what they have come to expect, is no longer hewing to the path of democratization and has in fact become a dictatorship."" That message will find an attentive but hesitant audience in Washington, according to diplomats and aid officials in East Africa and the United States. Museveni has enjoyed generous support from Western donors impressed by Uganda's economic progress and often thoughtful governance. Museveni's pioneering fight against AIDS helped reverse the scourge in Uganda. But Besigye, a former adviser to Museveni and official in his government, impressed outside observers with his presidential campaign, which focused on burgeoning corruption. And though he lost, 69 percent to 28 percent, Besigye appeared more the statesman afterward. Already under surveillance, he vowed to continue his reform movement through peaceful means, including an unsuccessful court appeal of the election results. Meanwhile, Museveni, whose government has tightly restricted political activity since he came to power, called Besigye a ""traitor"" and suggested he was linked to pipe bombings in Kampala, the capital, which have previously been blamed on minor rebel groups. Museveni also said he would punish areas that failed to support him in the March election by reducing government services there. The imperious flourishes further marred Museveni's standing, already reduced by corruption scandals at home and military misadventure in neighboring Congo. Besigye, a retired colonel in the Ugandan army, said only two people besides Museveni knew the president was ordering troops across the Congolese border in August 1998. Once there, the army fought with its nominal ally, Rwanda, and drew allegations that senior Ugandan officials were looting timber, gold and other resources. Besigye said the World Bank and International Monetary Fund should demand ""democratization benchmarks just like you have economic benchmarks."" Museveni's penchant for personalizing rule -- and failure to create democratic institutions that will survive him -- are at least as important to Uganda's future as macroeconomics, Besigye said. While the World Bank threatened Museveni with a cut in aid after the fighting against Rwanda, the bank and IMF prefer to leave it to individual donor countries -- led in Uganda's case by Britain, the United States and Scandinavian countries -- to set political conditions for aid. A State Department official noted that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell met with both Museveni and Besigye during a visit to Uganda in May. Afterward, he urged Uganda toward greater political freedom. ""We have never been that easy on Museveni,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity."6-Sep-01,KENYA (99%); UNITED STATES (94%),"When a Kenyan asks for a little tea, he may or may not have a hot beverage in mind. Tea is a popular drink here, usually served with healthy helpings of milk and sugar. But ""a little tea"" is also the slang used by bureaucrats, police officers or anyone else with an outstretched palm to ask for a bribe. In ""Nchi ya Kitu Kidogo,"" a new Kiswahili song that has taken Kenya by storm, Eric Wainaina tells those desiring a little tea to visit a popular tea-growing area in central Kenya. He recommends that those in need of a soda -- another word for bribe -- refresh themselves with a Fanta. ""A nation of 'something small,' "" he asserts, using still another bribery euphemism, ""is a nation of small people."" Mr. Wainaina's song, whose title means ""a nation of something small,"" has caught on among the wananchi, or everyday people, of this country, where corruption is commonplace. Police officers stop matatus -- the overcrowded vans that shuttle people to and fro -- and demand tea from the driver in the middle of the road. Underpaid civil servants remain aloof until they hear the crinkling of a 1,000 shilling note. Elected officials skim from the treasury a little something for themselves. ""No bribes should be given or accepted whether demanded or not,"" says the sign greeting passengers at the airport. The demands can begin as early as the baggage carousel. ""Corruption is not limited to ministers, permanent secretaries and other top state officials,"" Kiraitu Murungi, a member of Parliament, said at a recent conference on the topic. ""Corruption is everywhere. The chief, the businessman, the teacher, the driver, the messenger, the farmer, the rich and the poor -- your brother and mine -- are involved."" But just because the problem is widespread does not mean Kenyans embrace the current state of affairs, as evidenced by the popularity of Mr. Wainaina's anticorruption anthem. Radio stations say they are playing the song over and over because listeners keep requesting it. And many of those matatus, known for their breakneck speeds and blaring sound systems, seem to have adopted the catchy tune as their own. Mr. Wainaina, 27, took a break from his studies at the Berklee College of Music in Boston to make his new CD, ""Sawa Sawa"" (""It's O.K.""), which was produced and arranged by Christian Kaufmann in the Boston area. ""I'm not a politician,"" Mr. Wainaina said. ""I'm just a young Kenyan living at a time when there's a lot happening in Kenya politically."" The World Bank office in Nairobi has been one of the largest en masse buyers of the compact disc, according to Mr. Wainaina's brother, Simon, who is his manager. The bank is withholding financial aid to Kenya until the government of President Daniel arap Moi takes serious steps toward addressing corruption. When Kenya's Parliament failed last month -- despite a rare personal appearance by the president -- to endorse an independent body to investigate corruption, Mr. Moi announced that he would set up a special police unit to do the job. International financial institutions remain skeptical of the government's commitment to stamping out the problem. One indication of that commitment may be the official reaction to Mr. Wainaina's song. He delivered the CD to the state-run Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, the only station with a national reach, but officials there so far have declined to broadcast it. When he began singing the song at a national school musical festival last month -- in front of the vice president and other government ministers, no less -- organizers cut the microphone before he was through. ""The impression that the Kenya government doesn't want people singing about corruption is the wrong impression,"" said Silverse Anami, the deputy director of culture, a singer himself and the man who gave Mr. Wainaina the ax. Mr. Anami said corruption was a real vice in Kenya and that music ought to address it. But he said there was a time and place for everything, and Mr. Wainaina had not been scheduled to perform when he did. An earlier Wainaina song, called ""Kenya Only,"" won praise from politicians, including Mr. Moi, who heard the young singer perform it at a ceremony and asked him for a repeat performance. The government, however, has not called for an encore of the anticorruption number. ""It's a sensitive song,"" Mr. Wainaina said, recalling the music festival. ""All these big shots of the government were there. I saw them motioning for me to stop. I said to myself, 'I'm not going to stop because a couple of people are getting their feathers ruffled.' If there is one thing that Kenyans live under it's the fear of challenging authority. By singing, I showed that it's possible to stand up and speak without putting your life in danger."" The Kenyan government does promote songs that address societal ills in its national music competitions. There are separate categories for songs dealing with such topics as AIDS, female genital mutilation and even corruption. But the songs are judged not just on how well they depict the problem but whether they also offer a solution, Mr. Anami said. ""I believe this world must be better than it is,"" said Mr. Anami, sounding not at all like a censor. ""Messages through songs, through poetry, through theater, act as mirrors. Through them the society is able to see what their face really looks like."""18-Nov-01,"ALGERIA (99%); UNITED STATES (93%); SAUDI ARABIA (92%); MOROCCO (92%); AUSTRIA (79%); LATIN AMERICA (79%); IRAN, ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF (79%)","CHEKIB KHELIL, the president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, will tell you that the only house he owns is in Potomac, Md. He is an Algerian, but he grew up in Morocco. When he is not directing OPEC, he runs Algeria's oil ministry, but his wife and two grown sons are American citizens. As he tries to reorganize the Algerian energy sector, he draws on his 20 years of experience in reforming the oil industries of Latin America as an official at the World Bank. A life that has coursed through so many different cultures appears to have given Mr. Khelil, 62, a flair for compromise and diplomacy that is crucial for steering the OPEC ship, with its conflicting egos and national interests. It certainly gave him the toughness to embark, right or wrong, on a price war last week with OPEC's biggest rival, Russia. In a move that blindsided the markets and sent world petroleum prices to two-year lows, the OPEC ministers meeting here chose not to reduce output unless non-OPEC producers did the same. ""Of course, it will hurt our economy, Saudi Arabia's, Iran's,"" Mr. Khelil said, ""but it will hurt non-OPEC producers, too. We are not trying to put anybody on their knees. We want other producers to share in the pain if they are going to share in the benefits."" And pain it will be. Mr. Khelil's assurances notwithstanding, OPEC wants very much to put Russia and other uncooperative producers on their knees. To bolster falling oil prices as the global economy slowed, the 10 voting members of OPEC reduced production by 3.5 million barrels this year, or 13 percent of total output. But OPEC's rivals increased production, cashing in on the high average price of $25 a barrel for oil and gobbling up some of OPEC's market share. OPEC said last week that it would no longer tolerate such a situation. Russia, the world's second-largest exporter of oil, after Saudi Arabia, remains defiant. It is a price war, a term that makes Mr. Khelil wince ever so subtly. Algeria gets 60 percent of its budget revenue and nearly all its foreign-currency earnings from oil, according to Mr. Khelil. As prices tumble, the country will be hit hard. Stumbling out of years of a civil war that has left as many as 100,000 dead, the country must cope with what many Algerians see as continued repression and political corruption. Oil money, and a great measure of fair government, could help fix those problems, Mr. Khelil acknowledged. ""We are going to have an explosion of social needs now that people are feeling some new freedom again, which we have to meet,"" he said. ""And oil is our only resource."" After leaving the World Bank in Washington, a posting that explains the house in Maryland, Mr. Khelil has cast his lot with Algeria's president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, a childhood friend from the same hometown in Morocco. In 1999, Mr. Khelil took over the Ministry of Energy and Mines, and he is now the head of Sonatrach, the state oil company. (He lives in government quarters in Algiers.) Though Mr. Bouteflika is a civilian who was elected two years ago to succeed a junta, his administration is nonetheless dogged by controversy. All the other candidates in the race withdrew, and critics contend that the generals who once ran Algeria still do so from the shadows. But Mr. Khelil is certain there will be room in Algeria for what he has learned abroad. He is loath to say Algeria will privatize Sonatrach, though he oversaw the privatization of state petroleum concerns in Argentina and Peru. But he wants to make it more like a private company. ""From all those years in the West,"" Mr. Khelil said, ""I have no doubt that transparency, training, markets are the way to go."" After the turns his life took, there may have been no other route for Mr. Khelil except to return home. Algeria was in him, though he moved within other borders. His grandfathers farmed in western Algeria; his father was born there, in Tlemcen, where the last Arabs from Spain fled centuries ago, Mr. Khelil said. The elder Khelil was a tailor who ended up in the Moroccan town of Oujda, importing fine fabrics from France and outfitting local doctors and teachers, and, years later, his own overachieving son. Mr. Khelil grew up with five brothers and six sisters, ""and none of them wore a veil,"" Mr. Khelil said with a laugh. In the working-class family, the children seemed to thrive on education. They became doctors and teachers. But Mr. Khelil was intrigued by the coal mines he visited on school trips and decided to be a mining engineer. ""Does the year 1959 mean anything to you?"" he asked, suggesting that the year meant everything to him. It was then that Algeria was in the thick of a war of independence against France, its colonial master. For someone of Algerian descent like Mr. Khelil, then 20, studies in France were sealed off. So he went to the country that would take him, the United States. He gave up mining to pursue petroleum engineering at Ohio State. ""The coal mines in southwest Algeria are closed now,"" he said, ""so I guess it was a good bet!"" His speech is the accented, all-American English of ""gonna's"" and ""shoudda's,"" though he is the only one in his family who is still an Algerian citizen. At Ohio State, he met his wife, Najat Arafat Khelil, a Palestinian from the West Bank, who was there to get a doctorate in physics. They moved to Texas A&M University, where Mr. Khelil earned his doctorate in petroleum engineering and learned to tell Aggie jokes. They spent the 1970's in Algeria, and Mr. Khelil rose quickly to become an adviser to the president. But that president died -- ""a natural death,"" Mr. Khelil is quick to point out -- and Mr. Khelil went to work for the World Bank in Washington. His family became American citizens but always traveled back to Algeria. Mrs. Khelil rose to prominence as a leader in the peace movement between the Palestinians and Israelis. Despite the violence now, she still nurtures her hopes. With four grandchildren who are now in New York and New Jersey, the most recent one born early last week, the Khelils have a hard time staying away from their adopted country of shopping malls and interstates. The friends and quirky memories of home are there, if anywhere. The first Aggie joke that comes to Mr. Khelil touches on some foreigners who attended Texas A&M and who, like him, rose to prominence. ""What do you call an Aggie two years after graduation?"" he asked. ""Boss. What do you call him 30 years after graduation? Mr. Minister."""22-Dec-01,MOZAMBIQUE (96%),"The morning rain drenches the sidewalk shrine on the Avenue of Martyrs, soaking the red and purple ribbons and the sagging banners that still plead for justice. Blood no longer stains the street here, but when the clouds burst, it seems even the heavens grieve. Over the past 13 months, two prominent men have been assassinated in this prosperous neighborhood, exposing the violence and corruption accompanying the country's remarkable economic growth. After more than a decade of hunger and civil war, Mozambique gave up its guns and socialism to embrace the free market in the early 1990's. Foreign investors are pouring in and Mozambique now has one of the world's fastest growing economies. But over it all is a deadly shadow. Carlos Cardoso, an investigative journalist, was gunned down last year on the Avenue of Martyrs, a few blocks from his office. Antonio Siba-Siba Macuacua, a senior banking official, was hurled to his death from the 15th floor of a nearby bank four months ago. Both men were investigating allegations of corruption and mismanagement in the privatization of two banks that went bankrupt after they were sold. Earlier this year, the accounting firm KPMG, brought in to do an audit as irregularities surfaced, reported that some of the country's most powerful men, including some government officials, had borrowed and failed to repay thousands of dollars from one of the banks. Mr. Cardoso had reported such scandals relentlessly in his independent newspaper. In June, Mr. Siba-Siba took the unprecedented step of publishing the names of more than 1,000 of the debtors in Mozambique's only daily newspaper. The men worked in separate worlds, but each wanted to ensure that public funds were not wasted in a country still desperately poor despite progress since the war ended in 1992. Now both are dead, and the political establishment is reeling. Mr. Cardoso was the chief news editor of Mozambique's state news agency, a founder of the country's first independent media company and a fierce defender of the poor. He rarely worried about his own safety. ""He thought by publishing, that was a weapon against any threat,"" said his widow, Nina Berg. In his independent daily newspaper, Metical, Mr. Cardoso reported that $14 million was siphoned out of Banco Comercial de Mocambique on the eve of its privatization in 1996 and that the prosecutor's office was doing nothing to pursue those responsible. He was 49 when he was shot to death by gunmen with AK-47's after he left his office in November 2000. Mr. Siba-Siba, a senior auditor at the central bank, was relatively unknown until the government gave him the high-profile task of cleaning up Banco Austral, the nation's third-largest bank and one of its most troubled institutions. He learned that more than a million dollars was unaccounted for and that hundreds of prominent people had large unpaid debts. He was 34 and one of the nation's brightest young economists when someone hurled him down the stairwell at Banco Austral in August. In his state of the nation address this month, President Joachim Alberto Chissano acknowledged that the transition to capitalism has been accompanied by an alarming surge in violence and organized crime. The government has linked the killings of Mr. Cardoso and Mr. Siba-Siba to corruption in the banks and it has vowed to catch the killers. Six people have been charged with murdering Mr. Cardoso, including a former manager of Banco Comercial de Mocambique and a prominent businessman. No arrests have been made in the killing of Mr. Siba-Siba. This month the independent weekly Savana published a biting cartoon under the caption, ""Minister of Interior is prepared to fight crime."" It depicts the minister blowing a whistle while the criminals continue killing right behind his back. The killings have deepened the ambivalence here about the country's economic reforms and its privatization program, which are often praised by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as among the most successful in Africa. Since Mozambique held its first democratic election in 1994, inflation has fallen to about 10 percent, from 50 percent, the I.M.F. says. The economy has expanded by about 10 percent a year since 1997, although it dipped after the floods of 2000 before rebounding this year. Mozambique now grows enough food for its own people, no small accomplishment in a country where thousands were near starvation in the 1980's. But the failed privatization of Banco Comercial de Mocambique and Banco Austral, which were sold in 1996 and 1997, has come at a heavy cost to the state, which still owns minority stakes in the banks. On the streets here, privatization is often derided as a scheme that has enriched a privileged few and opened the door to the gangsterism that followed Russia's economic reforms in the 1990's. Two of every three Mozambicans still live in poverty. In October the I.M.F. reported that the benefits of the economic reforms to the poor ""are likely to be relatively modest"" in the short term. ""Ordinary people don't feel it, so the tendency to think that the reforms to our system have their relation with crime is there,"" Prime Minister Pascoal Manuel Mocumbi said in an interview. ""When you have a transition from one system to the other, you open space for criminals, you open space also for other problems that were unforeseen."" The killings have also exposed the weaknesses of the justice system, which officials say is inefficient, poorly financed, corrupt and poorly equipped to fight organized crime. Police officers assigned to Mr. Cardoso's killing were suspended after they failed to conduct the most basic of inquiries, including interviewing potential witnesses. A senior prosecutor in the attorney general's office fled the country after it became clear he had failed to investigate the theft of $14 million from Banco Comercial that Mr. Cardoso had reported. A warrant has been issued for his arrest. Ms. Berg, Mr. Cardoso's widow, and his friend and colleague, Joseph Hanlon, have also criticized Western donors who provided technical assistance and financial support to the banks but did little to resolve their problems before privatization. In a 1998 assessment of its programs here, the World Bank criticized its own strategy of supporting the two banks in the 1990's without correcting their ""almost total deficiency of corporate governance and widespread practice of politically motivated lending."" The report said 90 percent of the loans issued by Banco Austral and Banco Comercial would probably never be repaid. Mr. Hanlon, a journalist who also chronicled the collapse of the banks in Metical, said officials and donors knew the dangers when they privatized. On the Avenue of Martyrs, at the shrine set up after Mr. Cardoso was killed, there is a sign, ""Guns won't silence our voices."" Not far from the shrine, in a coffee shop in the bustling heart of this rapidly modernizing city, the uncle who raised Mr. Siba-Siba wept over a glass of Coca-Cola. This month the family took out a newspaper advertisement commemorate the young man who dreamed of sending his two children to college. ""We are a family destroyed,"" said Jorge Antonio Macuacua, the uncle, who considered Mr. Siba-Siba a son.  ""I'm not afraid to speak in my son's name, to demand an answer from the government,"" he said. ""Everybody in town is looking to the government for an answer. Mozambique is better than before. It is developing. But if nothing is done, then these people are going to keep killing."""16-Mar-02,AFRICA (95%); ZIMBABWE (94%); SENEGAL (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); GHANA (79%); NIGERIA (79%),"Robert Mugabe's declaration of victory in the presidential elections held last weekend in Zimbabwe was, despite his unpopularity, hardly a surprise. He had already tweaked the system in so many ways that such an outcome was nearly inevitable. As Morgan Tsvangirai, who lost to Mr. Mugabe, said, the election was stolen in a ""daylight robbery."" It is neither surprising nor inappropriate, therefore, that most Western supporters of democracy have condemned the elections. What is a surprise and a tremendous disappointment is the endorsement of the elections by the Organization of African Unity, which had sent an observer team. Citing high turnout rates and the ""able manner"" in which polling officers conducted the election, the organization, which was founded in 1963 and has 53 member states, declared that ""in general, the elections were transparent, credible, free and fair."" The elections were none of those things. Thugs associated with the ruling party had physically attacked opponents of the Mugabe regime for months prior to the election. Mr. Tsvangirai's party, the Movement for Democratic Change, estimates that 100 of its supporters were killed in pre-election violence. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Mugabe's supporters broke up opposition rallies. Much of the international press was run out of the country. Mr. Mugabe implemented laws that curtailed press freedom, limited mass gatherings, undermined the independence of the electoral administration and altered (in the ruling party's favor) the requirements for voting. In the week before the election, Mr. Mugabe's electoral commission reduced the number of polling places in urban areas, where the opposition party had strong support. On the two days set out for the election -- as well as a third, allowed by the Supreme Court when it became clear that urban polling stations were overwhelmed -- Mugabe supporters reportedly intimidated voters and chased away independent observers. What makes the verdict of the Organization of African Unity profoundly disappointing is not just that it is so clearly wrong, but that it harks back to old and destructive habits, weakens recent commitments to positive change and may undermine the fragile relationships that have been developing between Africans and international aid institutions. The O.A.U. has long been perceived as a club for corrupt, authoritarian leaders distinguished primarily by a tolerance of each others' misdeeds. However, the past decade has been one of political liberalization across the continent. Competitive, if not exactly flawless, elections took place in some of Africa's highest-profile countries, including Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal and South Africa. Bolstered by evidence that stable democracies provide a better environment for investment, and therefore development -- and encouraged by a greater interest in good governance on the part of donor institutions like the World Bank -- Africa's new democratic leaders called for a continentwide commitment to democratic principles. The O.A.U. launched the New Partnership for Africa's Development last October. The partnership's manifesto acknowledges that ""development is impossible in the absence of true democracy"" and calls for leaders ""to respect the global standards of democracy, the core components of which include . . . fair, open, free, and democratic elections."" Africa was to have a ""new resolve to deal with conflicts and censure deviation from the norm."" The failure to criticize the way the Zimbabwean elections were conducted demonstrates that the new resolve and the confidence to censure deviation have yet to be found. The partnership could be easily dismissed as a rhetorical exercise and left unmourned. Such failures are common enough. But the need for something like the African partnership is so great that one hates to dismiss it, even after this miserable performance. The O.A.U.'s acceptance of the Zimbabwe mess hinders the effort under way to realize the United Nation's Millennium Declaration -- a truly novel effort to fight global poverty. At the heart of this effort, which has been endorsed by the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development as well as the Bush administration, is a compact between rich countries and poor ones: The former will be more generous and aggressive in attacking poverty, provided the latter commit to the economic policies and democratic institutions most likely to be conducive to real progress. The New Partnership for Africa's Development seemed to be evidence that African governments had committed to making changes in their approach to development, and that governments in developed countries could have more faith that their aid would bring positive results. The O.A.U.'s endorsement of Mr. Mugabe's conduct will undermine that faith. Yet the events in Zimbabwe should not lead wealthier countries simply to give up hope for political and economic progress in the region. Next week's International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico, sponsored by the United Nations, presents the chance for leaders of poor and rich countries alike to recommit themselves to spreading the benefits of globalization and the principles of good governance. African leaders acquiescing to Mr. Mugabe's election fraud needlessly endanger hope for progress on that front."19-Mar-02,ANGOLA (97%); UNITED STATES (94%),"Jim Hoagland [op-ed, Feb. 28], while criticizing Angolan guerrilla Jonas Savimbi's life as ""wasted,"" ignored the fact that Mr. Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) was the only viable entity capable of forcing the Angolan government into holding the nation's first elections in 1992. The other prominent anti-colonialist, Holden Roberto (who stayed in exile until 1992), along with UNITA and nearly a dozen smaller unarmed opposition parties, roundly denounced the rampant electoral fraud. Jose Eduardo dos Santos was never duly elected president because his government, in the middle of a truce and negotiations for the presidential runoff election between Mr. Savimbi and Mr. dos Santos, launched a massive ethnic cleansing, killing 50,000 people, according to Catholic Church sources. Angola remains a dictatorship, where residents in the capital city of Luanda search for food from trash cans despite billions annually in oil revenue, one-third of which is unaccounted for, according to the World Bank. The United States justly supported the only faction, UNITA, demanding national reconciliation and self-determination. Alexandria President Bush spent much of his recent Asian trip touting America's values, but the recent report on the killing of Jonas Savimbi [front page, Feb. 23] reminded me that history has a different story to tell. The report noted that Mr. Savimbi was infamous for ""a brand of barbarism that included burning foes at the stake."" But that didn't stop the rebel leader from becoming ""a favorite of the United States"" or from being treated ""like a head of state"" by the Reagan White House. It would be prudent for the Bush administration to seek counsel from our nation's unfortunate history of embracing despots (including Saddam Hussein) before we make ourselves the final arbiter of what and who is ""evil."" Silver Spring"22-Mar-02,AFRICA (99%); MEXICO (92%); MALI (92%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%); ANGOLA (79%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%); COTE D'IVOIRE (79%); SUDAN (79%),"Since the end of the cold war, private aid organizations have mushroomed across Africa, addressing every conceivable need in seemingly every corner of the world's poorest continent. To supporters, the groups -- better known in the diplomatic world as N.G.O.'s, or nongovernmental organizations -- are essential to Africa's burgeoning democracy, giving communities the money and power to take part in their own development and circumvent ineffective or corrupt governments. To critics, they are new colonialists who instill dependency among Africans, and their contributions to Africa's development are hard to measure. Whatever the reality, the central role played in foreign aid by these organizations is acknowledged by their prominent place this week at the poverty and development conference in Monterrey, Mexico. An estimated 25,000 such organizations operate around the world. ""Five years ago, 50 percent of World Bank projects had N.G.O. involvement,"" said William Reuben, coordinator of the bank's N.G.O. and civil society section. ""Now that figure is 70 percent."" Since last year, the organizations have assumed an important policy-making role in 32 developing countries that have qualified for debt reduction. Those countries have agreed to consult with private aid groups on how to use money freed up from the debt reduction. Most of the organizations involved in those efforts are local, not branches of international ones, Mr. Reuben said. Increasingly, he said, Western donors are financing local groups directly, instead of going through international structures. ""It's becoming a trend and that has made the international N.G.O. community think about their role,"" Mr. Reuben said. The first rethinking about aid to Africa took place with the end of the Cold War. Until then, rich nations gave money directly to African governments and mostly financed the buildup of infrastructure. But in the early 1990's, as the West tied aid to democratization, the independent organizations began flourishing. Foreign N.G.O.'s were respected for their skills in carrying out development projects that would actually benefit ordinary Africans; the local groups, meanwhile, were the foundation of a civil society necessary for democracy. ""That shift was much more beneficial and had more impact,"" said Chris Conrad, the programs director for southern and western Africa for CARE, one of the biggest independent aid groups. Mr. Conrad, who has worked in Africa for 25 years and is now based in Johannesburg, pointed to community-sponsored schools in Mali. With the Malian government unable or unwilling to build schools, many communities have started their own, with the help of private aid groups. Some critics say the organizations have created dependency among Africans and their governments, which rely increasingly on them to provide services that would ordinarily be filled by the state. At one extreme, relief groups are providing so many services in places like Angola and southern Sudan that the authorities there can use their resources for long-running wars. But even in a peaceful country like Mali, does helping a village build a school absolve the government of its real responsibility? Bruce Wilkinson, a senior vice president for World Vision in Washington who spent 15 years in West Africa, rejects that criticism. ""Creating dependency is a problem,"" he said. ""But what's the alternative? If vaccination coverage is 5 to 10 percent in a specific area and there is no N.G.O., that vaccination coverage will continue at those levels for the next generation. How many children will die?"" Careful decisions, however, can limit dependency, Mr. Wilkinson said. After a drought in Mali, he said, food was supplied to herders. ""We saved many lives,"" he said. ""But we stayed too long, and they didn't return as quickly as they should have to their herding or other income-generating activities."" Critics of the groups say they have so much power that the good they do is undermined by the side effects of their presence. The groups are a new way for Western governments to perpetuate their influence in Africa, these critics say, and are in reality not accountable to Africans. The groups that provide relief are a big business that thrives on disasters. Often, they hire away the most-talented Africans, lured by salaries that African governments or businesses cannot match, experts say. Many organizations that do not focus on development, but are advocates for human rights and other causes, are simply businesses that collect grants from Western donors, critics say. In Nigeria, some of these organizations participated fully in the fight against past military regimes, but others appear to do little except to insert their names occasionally in a newspaper article. ""In Africa, a $10,000 grant buys you an N.G.O., so these groups have multiplied exponentially,"" said Marina Ottaway, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""One of their main characteristics is that they have three people: a director, a secretary and a driver. They do not have members. Their usefulness in promoting democracy is very limited."""24-Mar-02,UNITED STATES (93%); MEXICO (92%); MOZAMBIQUE (79%); SENEGAL (79%); NORTHERN EUROPE (79%); UGANDA (79%); AFRICA (79%),"Half the world's population lives on $2 a day or less. Can prosperous nations best help them by spending significantly more on foreign aid, or by better targeting their assistance and making it more efficient? Both, is the sensible answer that came out of the United Nations' International Conference on Financing for Development, held last week in Monterrey, Mexico. But even though rich nations have pledged to reverse recent declines in assistance, it is not clear that they are prepared to invest enough. The United Nations estimates that it will take a doubling of the nearly $50 billion spent globally each year in foreign aid to meet its ambitious goal of cutting poverty in half by 2015. Developed countries have long been asked to contribute 0.7 percent of their gross national product in foreign aid, but only a handful of Northern European countries do so. America's foreign aid budget currently amounts to barely a tenth of a percentage point. Before President Bush announced earlier this month that he would seek a 50 percent increase in America's aid spending by 2006, it appeared as if the White House might hide behind the more-versus-better debate on foreign aid to avoid heeding the United Nations' call for a greater commitment. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill has been particularly critical of the World Bank and other international development bodies, claiming that they had ""precious little"" to show for their trillion-dollar effort over the decades. Much of his criticism is valid. Too often, the World Bank's low-interest loans have been funneled to corrupt governments that have not been held accountable. Critics like Mr. O'Neill rightly want to see more grants, instead of loans, earmarked for the poorest countries, and not necessarily for their governments. America's own track record has been far from stellar. Throughout the cold war, aid was funneled to key allies that were not always the most deserving humanitarian cases. Helping countries escape poverty has also proved more complicated than anyone imagined more than a half-century ago, when the United Nations and its development agencies were established. Trade, private investment and good governance have proved far more influential than charity in lifting living standards. Yet the recent experience of African countries like Mozambique, Uganda and Senegal, where foreign aid has provided sound reformist governments with seed money to great effect, is the latest reminder that assistance can play a pivotal role in alleviating misery and encouraging growth. Foreign aid does not always produce results, but the chances of success almost always rise when aid is delivered to countries that have adopted policies that promote social welfare and economic growth. President Bush eloquently made that point in Monterrey on Friday. It is encouraging that an administration so critical of past foreign aid recognizes that it must reform how the money is spent and then invest even more. The war on terrorism has undoubtedly helped the president reach that conclusion. The European Union has also announced substantial increases in its aid spending. Development agencies like the World Bank and poor nations themselves are acknowledging the lessons from the past. Much of the talk in Monterrey was about the need to condition aid on a recipient nation's willingness to embrace and promote free markets, human rights, the rule of law, education, women's rights and property rights. There is still a significant gap between the aid pledged by rich countries and what is needed. The imperative now, as aid dollars are invested more wisely, is to close that gap."2-Jun-02,"AFRICA (99%); MALI (96%); GHANA (93%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (92%); SENEGAL (92%); UNITED STATES (92%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%); MAURITIUS (92%); ZIMBABWE (92%); RUSSIAN FEDERATION (79%); SIERRA LEONE (79%); ZAMBIA (79%); NAMIBIA (79%); MALAWI (79%); BOTSWANA (79%); UGANDA (79%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%); EUROPE (79%); LESOTHO (79%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (79%); NIGERIA (79%); KENYA (79%); EASTERN EUROPE (53%)","The elders danced in their fraying turbans as the opposition party's candidate for president campaigned across the swirling sands of the Sahel. On Election Day, the old men and other opposition supporters turned out by the thousands to vote for change in one of the poorest countries in the world. What happened in the election here in West Africa early in May made few headlines in the West. The army did not send troops into the shabby cities nor did tanks roll through windswept villages when the ruling party lost the presidency after 10 years in power. Instead, governing party leaders took a step that was notable for its seeming ordinariness: they held a news conference at the local convention center and conceded defeat. It was a sign of changing times. Imperfectly, reluctantly, tentatively, democracy is inching across a continent better known for wars, disease, corruption and repression. Since 1990, 42 of the 48 countries in sub-Saharan Africa have held multiparty elections, the World Bank says. Not since Africans began shaking off colonial rule more than 40 years ago has the continent witnessed such broad political change. It was Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator of Zaire, who famously declared, ""Democracy is not for Africa."" In the early 1980's, he did not seem far off course. Only four countries were holding multiparty elections then on a continent dominated by autocrats and military juntas. Today, despite common complaints of vote rigging and political intimidation, most Africans have the right to choose their leaders at the ballot box. Over the last two years, governing parties in four nations -- Senegal, Mauritius, Ghana and Mali -- have peacefully handed power to opposition party rivals. In some ways, the political transformation in Africa resembles the faltering transition that began in Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In both regions, some nations are moving forward as others stumble. In both places, people are watching with ambivalence and anxiety as political and economic changes are sometimes accompanied by corruption, crime and deepening poverty. For many ordinary Africans, the tangible benefits of the political change remain elusive. National leaders in Zimbabwe, Kenya and the Congo Republic have been accused of manipulating the electoral process to maintain a veneer of legitimacy while continuing to persecute or sideline their critics. And, at least so far, democracy has often been followed by a period of deteriorating living standards. Many Africans are now freer but poorer than they have been in decades. The long economic decline has been linked to poor leadership, falling demand for Africa's commodities and the reluctance of Western governments to open their markets to African products. Market reforms adopted by many of the newly elected governments have not yet eased poverty. Foreign aid to Africa, which soared during the cold war when the Soviet Union and United States competed for allies among the continent's dictators, has dropped to its lowest levels. Disillusionment is growing against those African leaders and Western nations whose commitment to African democratization seems unsteady. But Africa's much-publicized failures obscure the evolving political landscape after a decade when millions of first-time voters cast ballots from the deserts of Mali to the green hills of South Africa. South Africa, Mozambique and Senegal are among those countries taking steps forward, even as others falter. ""The popular perception of even quite well informed people in the U.S. is to write Africa off, but it's not universally bleak,"" said Michael Bratton, a political scientist at Michigan State University who has analyzed African elections. The development of flawed democracies is still considered progress to people carrying the physical and mental scars left by authoritarian regimes. In May, thousands of jubilant voters in Sierra Leone cast ballots for president in the country's first elections since its civil war, which lasted throughout the 1990's. In Lesotho, which was battered by an attempted coup in 1998, citizens peacefully elected a new Parliament that same month. With the longstanding leaders of Mozambique, Namibia and Angola announcing that they will not run for re-election, more political transitions seem likely. Here in Mali, where shepherds chase skinny goats across the parched earth, people still grumble about hunger and political corruption. Many complaints of voting irregularities and vote rigging were lodged, mostly against the governing party; the Constitutional Court threw out more than 500,000 votes in the first round of voting. But there is also talk among villagers of meetings with the mayor and praise for the new wells, clinics and schools that have come since military rule ended in 1992. ""Justice prevails a little more,"" said Sulamo Djiguiba, a wizened old man who was contemplating democracy on Election Day. ""During the military regime, soldiers would just come and arrest us and make us work for the army or on their farms. Now that doesn't exist. We are free. We can go where we like."" Ansema Djiguiba, 25, agreed. ""The mayor and his representatives come and we have the right to talk about our needs without fear,"" he said. ""They have dug wells for us. Some villages have schools. But we are still asking for more help. Many people are still hungry."" In June, African leaders will discuss the continent's progress when they meet in Canada with leaders of big industrial nations. The aim is to persuade Western governments to increase foreign aid and investment for Africa's fledgling democracies. The presidents of South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal and Algeria say that a new generation of African leaders is committed to good governance and respect for human rights. In a plan called the New Partnership for Africa's Development, these four presidents have promised to create a peer review system to ensure African compliance with democratic principles. The plan has been praised by President Bush and the prime ministers of Britain and Canada, but it is unclear how widely it will be embraced on this continent, where reform-minded leaders and autocrats coexist uneasily. ""We must not be complacent,"" said Ibrahim Gambari, the United Nations special representative for Africa, who is from Nigeria. ""There are still 17 ongoing conflicts. Africa is still the poorest continent in the world, the biggest sufferer of H.I.V. and AIDS, the continent with the most external debts and the least foreign investment. But we are lot more hopeful than we were 5 or 10 years ago."" In the early 1980's, such hope was unimaginable. The continent was dominated by military juntas, one-party states and white-minority governments, with only Mauritius, Gambia, Senegal and Botswana holding multiparty elections. But change was coming. The cold war was ending along with foreign sponsorship of Africa's dictators. Economic discontent was encouraging new opposition movements. By 1990, when Benin became the first African country to move from dictatorship to multiparty democracy, election fever was growing. From 1990 through 1994, 54 elections were held in 29 countries and about half were deemed free and fair by official election observers, according to Professor Bratton's analysis. Eleven sitting presidents were voted out of office during that first flurry of elections. Three more presidents decided not to seek re-election. So dramatic was the rush to adopt democratic forms of government that some academics describe this period as Africa's ""second independence."" All across the continent, from post-apartheid South Africa to newly democratic Nigeria, new newspapers and political parties have emerged, exposing corruption and incompetence and widening the space for dissent. The enthusiasm has faded in many countries as many elected leaders have found themselves confounded by entrenched poverty, ethnic tensions and corruption. Some presidents have continued to repress journalists and political rivals, leaving people to question the differences between dictatorship and democracy. But in a recent survey of public opinion in 12 African countries, coordinated by professors in South Africa, Ghana and the United States, 70 percent of the respondents said democracy was ""always preferable"" to nondemocratic forms of government. On Election Day in Sierra Leone, the exhilaration was palpable at a camp for those with hacked-off limbs, the injuries that defined the horrors of that country's civil war. Among them was Lamine Jusu Jarka, whose hands were cut off in a rebel attack in 1999. Mr. Jarka voted by stamping his ballot sheet with an ink-stained toe. ""This morning, I am voting for the future,"" he said. But the Afrobarometer survey also captured the disillusionment over the failure of the new political system to deliver economic benefits to the masses. While more than 80 percent of respondents said democracy should deliver jobs and access to education, nearly half said their living standards were getting worse, not better. The World Bank says the per capita income in sub-Saharan Africa -- about $474 a year -- is less today than it was at the end of the 1960's, measured in today's dollars. What ordinary people know is that they went hungry under authoritarian rule and still go hungry. Mali's president, Alpha Konare, was praised in Western capitals for stepping down after two terms in office. But at home, where 70 percent of the population is poor, some people say hardships have worsened since he was elected in 1992, in a vote that ended military rule. ""Unemployment is growing and the economic situation is still very bad,"" said Abdoulaye Diarra, 48, an electrician who voted for the opposition. ""Under the military regime, at least your money was worth something."" In Nigeria, where democracy returned in 1999 after 16 years of military misrule, rising lawlessness and government corruption have overshadowed real advances in personal freedom. ""Is this the dividend of democracy we are talking about?"" someone scrawled on a wall in a burned-out neighborhood in Lagos, which was riven by ethnic killings this year. ""We want a military regime for peace and stability."" Many of the states that have emerged from authoritarian rule depend on Western governments to cover the costs of their elections and ordinary budget items. Democracy in these places remains fragile. Even in Africa's most stable and prosperous countries, like South Africa, competitive multiparty systems are still struggling to emerge. Meanwhile, Africans are increasingly arguing that selective criticism from the West only encourages tactics like vote rigging and other irregularities. In the Congo Republic, with rich oil reserves, an election in March went almost unnoticed. Only one real candidate -- President Denis Sassou-Nguesso, a longtime ally of French and American oil companies -- stood on voting day. A new residency law effectively barred two candidates from running; the sole remaining competitor, Andre Milongo, a former prime minister, dropped out two days before the vote, saying the elections were rigged. ""On the one hand, the West is always talking to us about democracy,"" Mr. Milongo said. ""On the other hand, it did not support the democratic process here. It's empty talk."" But in Mali, the opposition defeated the governing party in May by snaring 70 percent of the vote. The winner, Gen. Amadou Toumani Toure, is revered for toppling the country's dictatorship in 1991. General Toure knows the challenges ahead. On the campaign trail, he sipped tea with elders and listened to jobless students. He told them their vote still mattered, even if democracy had not brought everything that everyone had hoped for. ""I don't say democracy can solve everything,"" he said on his campaign stop here. ""But it's better than anything we have seen so far."""20-Jun-02,AFRICA (98%); CARIBBEAN ISLANDS (93%); CANADA (79%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%),"President Bush will propose today to double spending on a U.S. initiative for education in Africa to $ 200 million over five years and will announce plans to travel to the continent next year, senior administration officials said yesterday. The announcement on African education will be the second, relatively modest foreign assistance plan unveiled within two days by an administration that has questioned whether such aid has been wasted on inefficient and corrupt governments. Yesterday, Bush pledged an additional $ 500 million over three years to help prevent HIV-infected mothers in parts of Africa and the Caribbean from transmitting the virus, which causes AIDS, to their infants. ""Medical science gives us the power to save these young lives. Conscience demands that we do so,"" the president declared in a Rose Garden ceremony. The flurry of initiatives come as Bush prepares to head next week to a summit of leaders from the Group of Eight leading industrial nations in Canada, where Africa will be a major focus. The $ 10 billion U.S. foreign aid budget is the lowest among rich countries as a percentage of economic output, and the new proposals could help the administration project a compassionate image at the summit. Most of the 20 million deaths from AIDS have occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV infection rates are the highest in the world. The United Nations estimates that 800,000 children were born last year infected with the virus, even though as little as a single dose of medication to mother and child at birth can prevent transmission up to half the time. Bush's initiative aims to prevent up to 146,000 infant infections over the next five years. It is projected to provide extended treatment with life-extending anti-retroviral drugs for infected infants and their parents in numbers that will increase as the program expands. But while saying the proposals were welcome, activists, aid advocates and some in Congress criticized them as too little, too late. The AIDS initiative focused on the least politically sensitive aspect of care and treatment for a disease that is most often transmitted through adult sexual activity. ""By choosing to focus primarily on 'innocent' newborns,"" said the Global Alliance of activist groups, ""Bush is leaving women, families and communities for dead."" There was also criticism of the size of the funding, and what some saw as an attempt to take credit for congressional initiatives they believed Bush had helped undermine. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), who along with Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) had proposed $ 700 million in new spending this year on global AIDS programs, yesterday called the Bush plan a ""shell game,"" saying it ""provides no funding beyond that already provided by the Senate until the year 2004."" Bush's $ 500 million consists of $ 200 million the House and Senate have already added to the president's proposed emergency terrorism appropriation for this year, which administration officials said would be spent over this year and next, and $ 300 million that Bush said he would put in his fiscal 2004 budget request next year. This year's budget for global AIDS projects is about $ 1 billion, without the new funding. Rock star Bono, a global development advocate who last month accompanied Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill on a 10-day tour of Africa, issued a statement saying: ""This crisis urgently demands an historic presidential AIDS initiative. This isn't it, but could be the beginning of it."" Others in Congress and among nongovernmental organizations said they were glad to have what Bush proposed. Rep. Jim Kolbe (R-Ariz.), who shepherded the House's version of the $ 200 million in emergency funds, said he was ""especially pleased"" by Bush's initiative. Mark Isaac, public policy director at the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, called it ""real leadership . . . in fighting global AIDS."" Isaac said that working with mothers who care more about helping their children than avoiding the stigma often associated with AIDS in the developing world often provided a way to expand prevention and treatment. Paul De Lay, director of the HIV/AIDS office at the U.S. Agency for International Development, said that infants infected even after treatment with nevirapine, the drug used to reduce transmission rates from mothers, would be put on a permanent regime of anti-retroviral drugs, along with those infected mothers and fathers whose stage of disease qualifies them for treatment. The program is initially targeted at eight African countries, to expand to 12 by 2004, plus Guyana and Haiti and a regional program for other Caribbean islands. The plan also includes improvements in health care infrastructure, an exchange program between U.S. and African and Caribbean hospitals and initiatives to provide African women alternatives to breast feeding, which can pass the disease. The education proposal is both an increase in size and a fleshing out of specifics for an initiative that Bush unveiled last year. Administration officials said the money will go to train 420,000 teachers, provide 250,000 scholarships for girls, and provide 4.5 million more textbooks for African schoolchildren. But the level of funding drew a negative reaction from aid advocates. The world's rich nations are being exhorted by the World Bank and other aid agencies to contribute billions of dollars a year to fund an initiative aimed at ensuring that all children in poor countries finish at least five years of schooling by 2015; currently, more than 100 million elementary-school-age children are not in class at all. The United States and other donor nations have backed the plan in principle but not all have been forthcoming with the money. ""I think it's disappointing that the president is thinking on such a small scale when the needs are so great,"" said John Ruthrauff, senior policy adviser at Oxfam America, citing estimates that $ 5 billion a year would be required to meet the U.N.-backed goal of achieving universal primary education by 2015. Administration officials countered by emphasizing the importance of Bush's plans to visit Africa. Noting that Bush earlier this year proposed a 50 percent increase in U.S. foreign aid spending targeted at countries that adopt anti-corruption and free market policies, they asserted that the amount of money is much less important than Bush's demonstrated commitment to African development. ""As the president said today, as the [AIDS] initiative demonstrates success, we will provide more resources to it,"" one senior official said. ""That is this administration's approach -- instead of 'more money, more money, more money,' we're saying, 'more results, more results, more results,' and money will follow results."""21-Jun-02,AFRICA (99%); UNITED STATES (96%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%); CARIBBEAN ISLANDS (79%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%),"President Bush said yesterday the United States should spend $ 20 million more each of the next five years educating African children. Bush also announced an upcoming trip to the continent -- all part of his pledge to ""take Africa's side in confronting obstacles to hope."" The president outlined his administration's agenda for Africa at a black-tie gala in memory of the Rev. Leon Sullivan, a Philadelphia minister credited with helping to end apartheid in South Africa. ""The people of America have a duty to advance the cause of freedom in Africa,"" Bush told a glittering crowd of several thousand diplomats, top administration officials, civil rights leaders and corporate chieftains. ""America's interests and America's morality lead in the same direction."" Though the proposed spending boost would double the government's investment on an education initiative in Africa, the $ 200 million total was deemed modest by critics. The World Bank has estimated that wealthy donor countries will need to commit between $ 3 billion and $ 4 billion annually in additional foreign aid over the next 10 years to achieve the goal of universal primary education in the developing world by 2015. Estimates of the number of children in poor nations who have never attended school run as high as 125 million, about two-thirds of them girls. A bipartisan group of congressmen urged Bush to increase U.S. spending on basic education around the world to $ 1 billion per year by 2006. On Wednesday, the president promised an extra $ 500 million over three years to help prevent pregnant women in parts of Africa and the Caribbean from transmitting the AIDS virus to their children. Bush will travel to Canada next week for the Group of Eight summit of industrialized nations, which is intended to focus on the plight of sub-Saharan Africa. The White House hopes the new African initiatives will ease criticism about U.S. spending on developing nations and project a compassionate image of Bush to foreign leaders and American voters. As a percentage of economic output, the $ 10 billion U.S. foreign aid budget is the lowest among rich nations. The president's announcement that he plans to visit Africa next year drew gasps and a standing ovation from the hotel ballroom crowd. Bush said he plans to focus on increasing trade between the United States and African nations, reducing poverty, fighting corruption, protecting workers' rights and fostering human rights. ""Africa is a continent where promise and progress are important. And we recognize they sit alongside disease, war and desperate poverty -- sometimes in the same village,"" Bush said. ""We take Africa's side in confronting obstacles to hope and development."" Bush had harsh words for what he called the few African nations that continue to harbor terrorists and wage war on their own people, singling out the 19-year-old civil war in Sudan, during which an estimated 2 million people have died. Bush acknowledged cooperation from Sudan in the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan, but he said it can only improve relations by ending the civil war and banishing slavery. ""Sudan can and must do more,"" Bush said. ""Ending its support for terror outside Sudan is no substitute for efforts to stop war inside Sudan."""26-Jun-02,AFRICA (99%); UNITED STATES (95%); CANADA (94%); ZIMBABWE (93%); SOUTH AFRICA (92%); JAPAN (51%),"THE LEADERS of the leading countries gather in Canada today and tomorrow to talk, among other things, about helping Africa. But the three main channels of assistance that they will discuss are each cluttered with obstacles. The first channel is the ""African Renaissance"" plan put forward by South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki and other African leaders. This commits the continent to democracy, the rule of law and anti-corruption efforts; the hope is that good governance will be rewarded by inflows of fresh capital. It's a good plan in theory and is welcome in that it's written by Africans rather than outsiders. But it isn't credible. Mr. Mbeki has had a chance to put into practice his pro-democracy sentiments by pressuring his neighbor, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, into respecting political, human and economic rights. But Mr. Mbeki has failed to intervene effectively while Zimbabwe's leader has stolen an election, tortured hundreds of opponents and expropriated private farms. Until Mr. Mbeki and other African leaders get serious about isolating Mr. Mugabe, it will be difficult to take the African Renaissance plan seriously. The second channel is an initiative to expand primary-school enrollment in poor countries. Two years ago the rich governments represented at the Canada summit promised to back developing nations that came forward with sound education policies. The World Bank, acting in consultation with donor governments, has reviewed a large number of proposals and judged 18 of them sound. But although the Bush administration deserves credit for keeping this initiative alive over the past 18 months, it appears disinclined to back it with cash. Other donor countries may prove more generous. But if the United States remains on the sidelines, an effort to help Africa that has taken two years to develop may now lose momentum. The third potential channel for helping Africa is trade. Last November the Bush administration helped to launch a new round of trade talks and gave it a pro-Africa twist: This new ""Development Round"" would focus on things that matter to Africans, such as cutting barriers to farm exports. But the administration then broke its halo by signing on to the huge jump in subsidies for domestic farmers -- subsidies that will boost production in the United States, so squeezing out exports from poor countries. The Japanese and Europeans practice outragreous farm protection too. But reformers in Brussels and Tokyo are having a hard time arguing for more open farm trade now that the United States has marched off in the opposite direction. Unfortunately, therefore, the summit in Canada is unlikely to help Africa much, though we'd be delighted to be proven wrong. Meanwhile in Washington, there is something that could make a difference. Congress needs to revive presidential trade promotion authority, which has passed both chambers but which has yet to go to conference. The chief obstacle is the refusal of Rep. Bill Thomas (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to accept reasonable Democratic proposals to help workers who lose jobs as a result of trade. Unless Mr. Thomas relents, he may lack the votes to get the trade measure through the House after the conference negotiations. The midterm elections are approaching, and time is running out. Mr. Thomas, a smart champion of trade, should not let his views on unemployment insurance become yet another obstacle to Africa's advancement."7-Jul-02,UGANDA (94%); EASTERN AFRICA (90%); AFRICA (90%),"Ugandan newspapers have devoted considerable ink to the largest foreign investment project ever in East Africa -- a $550 million dam and power plant on the Victoria Nile. The project, first proposed in 1994, has plenty of dramatic elements -- money, power and, now, corruption. Last week, the project reappeared on front pages with the news that the World Bank was suspending its financing amid allegations that a contractor had bribed a Ugandan official to move the project along. President Yoweri Museveni, who broke ground for the project months ago, says Uganda needs the dam to boost its meager power production. But environmentalists say it will damage the scenic Bujagali Falls, which have spiritual significance to some locals. ""Those who are playing with the Bujagali dam project do not know what they are playing with,"" Mr. Museveni fumed in the state-owned New Vision newspaper, vowing to finance the project with government funds if the World Bank balks. In an editorial, the paper called for the jailing of any corrupt officials but recommended that the dam proceed. ""It is too important to be derailed by this relatively minor matter,"" the paper said.   MARC LACEY"25-Sep-02,GHANA (93%); UNITED STATES (92%); PHILIPPINES (79%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%); BRAZIL (79%); DOMINICAN REPUBLIC (79%); PAPUA NEW GUINEA (79%),"Wall Street gets it. So does Congress. Even President Bush gets it. But not the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. The era of market fundamentalism is over. Marketization, deregulation and privatization, and the opportunities for market manipulation offered by inadequate regulation -- all central elements in the rise and fall of Enron -- are now discredited in the United States. And in developing countries, where their effects have been most devastating, they are the object of widespread public opprobrium. Unfortunately, the IMF and the World Bank continue to sing from the market-fundamentalist hymnal. * Marketization: Just as Enron created new markets in exotic commodities such as bandwidth, so the IMF and the World Bank have worked to marketize services previously in the public and noncommercial realm. Case in point: user fees for primary health care. The World Bank continues to support such charges, even after reversing its support for education fees. The effect is to deny poor people access to care. In Papua New Guinea, for instance, the introduction of user fees led to a decline of about 30 percent in the average monthly attendance at outpatient health centers. * Deregulation: Reckless deregulation in California enabled Enron and other energy companies to gouge customers. Similarly, IMF- and World Bank-induced deregulation in developing countries has had disastrous consequences. In the Philippines and in Ghana, for example, deregulation in the mining sector has opened the country to giant multinational companies, displacing tens of thousands of residents and paving the way for environmental devastation. * Privatization: Central to Enron's international agenda was the takeover of privatized electricity and water services in developing countries. One country where Enron sought to gain control of a privatized water system was Ghana. Concerns about corruption -- including those voiced by the World Bank -- led to the collapse of the deal. But the World Bank continues to push for water privatization in the West African nation. In preparation, water prices have doubled, and the bank anticipates prices rising for the foreseeable future, even though poor Ghanaian consumers can pay as much as 10 percent to 20 percent of their income for drinking water. In a country where one-third of urban consumers are not even connected to water pipes, the private operators would have no duty to expand service to the poor. In the Dominican Republic, World Bank-supported privatization let Enron swoop in, buy parts of the electric utility and jack up rates. When consumers and the government couldn't pay the high prices, Enron turned off the power. Enron and other buyers of the privatized utility are now alleged to have paid too little, thanks to a valuation performed by an Arthur Andersen subsidiary. * Financial market manipulation: Enron's financial fraud is now legendary. But consider the IMF's deceit in Brazil: Everyone knows the country has no prospect of paying off its foreign debt. But rather than acknowledging this and working out a discounted payment arrangement for creditors, the IMF is making new loans to pay off old ones. This has two immediate effects: It enables the private creditors, including the big U.S. banks, to be paid off, with debt obligations shifted to the IMF. And it enables the IMF to extract austerity measures from Brazil that are explicitly intended to lock in fundamentalist market policies, no matter which party Brazilians elect in coming elections. Restraints on corporate power are even more necessary in developing countries than in the United States. But the market fundamentalists at the IMF and the World Bank continue to systematically unshackle corporate activity in the Southern Hemisphere. That's a major reason thousands will demonstrate against the IMF and the World Bank in Washington this weekend. Action makes a difference: In 2000, after the last major U.S. demonstrations against the IMF and the World Bank, Congress passed a law requiring the United States to oppose IMF or World Bank loans that include user fees for primary education or health care. Partly as a result, Tanzania lifted primary education user fees, 1.5 million additional children -- mostly girls -- were able to go to school.

Acres said that it would appeal the verdict and the sentence. Acres said it had been exonerated of the same charges by the World Bank. The company said it was unaware that its representative in Lesotho was secretly paying part of his fee to the director of the water project in exchange for lucrative contracts. The director was earlier sentenced to 18 years in prison.   Bernard Simon (NYT)"19-Nov-02,KENYA (99%); AFRICA (93%); SUDAN (79%),"The bright yellow words painted on the building proudly advertise a photography studio, an African music store and a handmade furniture shop. In reality, though, the store doesn't sell or produce anything. The owners don't even have electricity. Two months ago, 30-year-old Urbunus Muthini Kitungu gave up his farming job and started what he called his ""dream business."" Yet these days, he sits in a dark room while a colleague pedals a bicycle to generate enough power to turn a lathe, allowing Kitungu to carve a simple piece of wood. President Daniel arap Moi promised this village of 3,000 people electricity. There are power lines running through the village, but the money needed to wire homes and businesses keeps disappearing into the pockets of politicians, townspeople said. ""Moi has done nothing for us,"" said Kitungu, who wouldn't need to use the bicycle wheel if he could plug a motor into an electrical socket. ""Actions talk louder than words. And there hasn't been action here in years."" For nearly a quarter-century, Moi has ruled as Kenya's omni-president, the vessel for the hopes, promises and disappointments of Kitungu and his countrymen.  The reign of one of Africa's longest-ruling Big Men will come to an end when parliamentary elections are held on Dec. 27 and Moi, 78, steps down. From rural farming villages to the bars of Nairobi, Kenyans say the end of Moi's rule is the most important turning point in the nation's history. Widely viewed as a beacon of hope and opportunity in the days after Jomo Kenyatta led the country to independence from Britain in 1963, Kenya has descended into poverty, corruption and crime under Moi. Moi's mansion looks out over the tin roofs of Kibera, Africa's largest urban slum. Crime in the capital is so widespread that the city is nicknamed Nairobbery. Africans who used to flee here from war-torn countries like Sudan and Congo are now afraid to even visit. Kenya ranks as one of the most corrupt nations in the world, according to the watchdog group Transparency International. ""There is hope for Kenya,"" said Mutahi Ngunyi, a political scientist in Nairobi with Consult Afrika, a private research firm. ""But at the moment we are not even at ground zero. We are at absolute zero, which is even lower than ground zero. Kenyans will miss Moi, but we don't need the comedy. We want a professional in government."" Most Kenyans can't remember a time when Moi was not president. Since he succeeded Kenyatta in 1978, Moi has shaped the nation of 31 million, with his image and name dominating every facet of society. Moi's face is etched on the country's currency. The state-run evening news begins every night by saying, ""His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi announced today. . . . "" There is a national holiday called Moi Day. Dozens of schools, hospitals, bridges and roads are named after Moi. There is Moi University, Moi Girls' School, Moi International Airport. Every business is required by law to hang his framed photograph. But Kenyans say Moi's legacy is a hollow one, that aside from his omnipresent image, he leaves behind little more than rampant corruption, crime and a dysfunctional political system that some Kenyans describe as democracy with a dictator. Janet Ouma, 25, a lawyer sitting in a hip Nairobi coffee house lamenting the state of the country, was born a year before Moi came to power and has known no other leader. ""I feel really bitter about it. Everyone does,"" Ouma said. ""I mean, even educated people live in a city where most people don't have electricity. It's painful."" Ouma and others stumble over one another to talk about Moi, throwing out facts about the decline of their country and how many Kenyans, who seldom saw a need to leave during better days, now want to emigrate to Europe or the United States. The young professionals can quote chapter and verse the economic indicators that showed Singapore and Kenya on equal footing in 1971 and show them starkly disparate now. Today, according to World Bank figures, the average Singaporean makes $ 19,500 per year while the average Kenyan earns just $ 350 -- the same wage as when the country became independent. Sixty percent of Nairobi's 2 million people live in slums, mostly in tiny rooms with no electricity. There is no garbage collection, so rotting food, human waste and shreds of clothing are burned in piles, steps away from where fresh vegetables are sold. The average slum resident earns the equivalent of $ 6 a month, according to the U.N. Human Settlements Program. Kenyans blame government mismanagement and corruption for the increasing poverty and resulting crime. Young and educated people in Nairobi say they can't find jobs because only those with connections to Moi's tribe or those willing to pay hefty bribes can get hired. Those who do find jobs often feel pressure from family members to take bribes to augment their meager wages. ""I used my brain to get where I am today, and I couldn't find work for a year,"" said Ann Maleyae, 28, who went to Romania to earn her degree rather than pay the bribes required to get into a Kenyan university. ""You want to just refuse bribes all the time, and then you don't get anything. My God, we are glad [Moi] is going, although he is leaving in such a sneaky way."" In Africa, coups and mysterious murders are the most common ways that longtime leaders are removed from power. Moi's departure has been carefully managed, indicating that he can still employ the wily machinations that have typified his reign, Kenyan political analysts said. When Moi chose his successor, he bypassed the hierarchy of his ruling Kenya African National Union party and anointed Uhuru Kenyatta, 41, a longtime ally who happens to be the son of the country's independence leader. But it remains to be seen whether the country will vote for Moi's choice or for the candidate of Kenya's newly united opposition. Many voters see little distinction, since many members of the opposition coalition only recently broke off from Moi's party, known as KANU. Either way, Moi's questionable legacy will remain long after Kitungu and others can legally remove his portrait from their struggling businesses. In Mombasa, a bustling port city on the Indian Ocean, Kenyans like to joke that the letters in Moi's name stand for ""My Own Interest."" Corruption is so much a part of the culture that last year the most popular song in Kenya was ""Country of Bribes."" ""If you're sick in the hospital or you lose your identity card, to get anything done in Kenya you have to pay a bribe,"" go the lyrics, written by Eric Wainaina, a 28-year-old pop star and television celebrity. ""It's so bad that my own kids ask me for a bribe of a juice box and money to go to school,"" Jumaa Kombo, a Mombasa taxi driver, said as his friends laughed even though he said he was being entirely serious. ""They learn it from their teachers, who learn it from their principals, who learn it from ministers, who learn it from Moi, and all of the money gets passed around."" Under Moi's leadership, such state services as education, trash collection and road repair have morphed into a sophisticated patronage system, said John Githongo, head of the Kenyan chapter of Transparency International. Political analysts here say that corruption burgeoned as Moi's popularity evaporated and money became the means for securing loyalty. After 14 years of rule in Kenya's one-party system, Moi bowed to pressure for democratic reforms and ran in his first election in 1992. He carried just 30 percent of the vote -- enough to win, because support for the opposition was split among several parties from the country's dozens of ethnic groups. The World Bank and other international institutions have withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in loans because of high-level patronage and bribery, much of which is funneled to Moi from family members and friends. Last year, Nairobi City Council officials found that hundreds of ""ghost"" workers -- many of them distant relatives of Moi or friends with connections -- collected city paychecks but were not officially employed. ""Moi was not concerned with performance,"" said Ngunyi, the political scientist. ""He is concerned with survival. And he rewarded those who helped him survive."" But in Africa, where successful people are expected to share their wealth with their family and tribe, some don't see corruption as harmful -- especially those who benefit from it. At the Moi Girls' School in Nairobi, teachers praise the president. When it was called Nairobi Girls' School, the institution was made up of several crumbling buildings, 100 students and no books. Now it is a boarding school with 850 students, fresh books and plans to build a recreation center. Pretty purple flowers line the manicured lawn, and students wear new blue uniforms. The principal is a member of Moi's Kalenjin minority tribe. So are many of the teachers and students. But Kenya's tumble has been so severe that even the fortunate few -- including Moi -- cannot avoid glimpses of what the leader's personal patronage has left. The unfinished, bumpy roads that wind like muddy footpaths through major towns are the most visible signs of the rampant misuse of funds. This month, Moi's Range Rover suffered a punctured tire on one of those crude tracks, and the president had to get a lift from a cabinet minister. Mohamed Soka needs to find a new job. For years, he has sold Moi's pensive-looking photograph to businesses. He used to sell 3,000 a month. Last month he sold two. ""He is really gone,"" said Soka, who was standing on a street in Mombasa. ""It is strange."" Some Kenyans said that despite all of the problems, they will miss the relative stability of the country under Moi. While countries across Africa were ravaged by war, Kenyans were largely spared. Speaking at a school for handicapped children on Moi Day, the honoree praised Kenya's stability and used it to deflect charges of corruption. ""Sometimes when I hear all of the criticism I ask myself, 'Are you tired of peace?' I wish people would go to the neighboring countries and then speak peace,"" Moi told the crowd. Analysts said that, in many ways, the spoils system kept some segments of the population from starting a revolution. ""With all this 'sharing of resources,' people live in hope,"" said Githongo of Transparency International. ""So if the second cousin of your uncle's brother has been made an assistant minister of the environment, then you are riding the gravy train and aren't about to overthrow the government. The problem is that it's a cannibalistic system that consumes the state."" On the radio and in the newspapers, there is constant debate over whether Moi should be prosecuted for his crimes. Most say he should be forgiven because he is old and should be venerated as an elder. ""We are so happy that he is leaving that we forgive him,"" said Ferdinand Watirla, 25, who sells clocks in Mombasa. ""We need to move on. He's been in office so long that he's too old to even put in jail."" In Klunduani, the villagers are also focused mostly on a future without Moi. Several months ago, members of the opposition coalition came and built wells. Before that, women here had to ride bicycles two hours up a hill to the nearest water supply. ""We got a new pipeline,"" said Kitungu, who is hopeful that his music and photo business will one day thrive. ""Now all we need is electricity."""27-Nov-02,AFRICA (95%); LESOTHO (94%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%); SOUTHERN AFRICA (79%),"The Lesotho Highlands Water Project has throttled wild rivers and drowned verdant valleys. Its concrete megadams have flooded out thatched huts, subsistence farms and grazing lands here in the impoverished mountain region known as the Roof of Africa. And now the project is embroiled in one of the biggest corruption scandals in the checkered history of African development. In other words, this $ 8 billion scheme to ship water from the rugged peaks of Lesotho to the industrial heartland of South Africa seems to exemplify the current stereotypes of major dams: massive, expensive, destructive, exploitative and corrosive -- except that the highlands project is also the financial lifeline of this landlocked kingdom, a dynamic source of money, energy and jobs in an otherwise medieval economy. ""People love to attack big dams, but water is Lesotho's only natural resource,"" said Malefetsane Lepele, the general manager of the project's environmental and social services group. ""It's cash. It's business. This project is the only way to keep this country alive."" Even though three of the project's five proposed dams are on hold because the calculations used to justify them were way off base, its former CEO is in jail and a dozen multinational corporations face bribery charges for feeding his Swiss bank accounts, a close look at Lesotho's experience suggests that big dams are not necessarily pure boondoggles. The project's water fuels growth in the vital Johannesburg area, which has an economic output exceeding the rest of southern Africa's. The project also benefits Lesotho, a Maryland-size nation where one-fourth of the 2.2 million residents are at risk of starvation and nearly one-third have HIV. The sale of fresh water -- ""Lesotho's White Gold,"" the brochures call it -- is pouring $ 20 million in annual royalties into the country's coffers, about one-fourth of its total exports. The project has supplied more than 7,000 jobs and all of Lesotho's electricity, while providing new health clinics, schools, sanitation facilities and roads and upgraded water-supply systems for 150 villages. It has promised full compensation for 30,000 residents affected by the dams, as well as training and aid to help them sustain themselves in the future. In general, the 16-year construction project has brought native highlanders -- who were often hours away from clean water and days away from a hospital -- much closer to the modern world. At the same time, the project has spawned a major spike in HIV rates by drawing outsiders to the hinterlands. But in interviews in the shadow of the 600-foot Katse Dam, Africa's tallest, and the slightly smaller Mohale Dam, completed this month, most Lesotho villagers said they welcomed the chance to modernize their lives. ""We want progress, and the dams bring progress,"" said Tsebo Pholo, a subsistence maize farmer who is now planting fruit trees and high-yield potatoes through programs created by the highlands project. ""We shouldn't stay behind in the old ways. We want electric lights and running water."" Before the dams, Malefatsa Natsoane was a typical Lesotho homemaker. Her husband worked in South Africa's mines, along with 140,000 of his countrymen; the money they brought home to the hills made up two-thirds of Lesotho's economy. Natsoane spent much of her time scavenging for water, firewood and food. A trip to buy maize meal required a 10-mile mountain trek. ""Oh, it was a very hard life,"" she recalled. Today, Natsoane's husband has lost his job, as have three-quarters of Lesotho's miners. But with the help of the highlands project, Natsoane, 56, has transformed herself into a one-woman rural conglomerate. She grows peach trees through the project's sustainable forestry program. She has learned candle-making, basket-weaving and ceramics through the project's training program, and sells her wares along the new paved road that cuts through her village of Ha Lejone. She grows seed potatoes through the project's agricultural assistance program, as well as beet roots and mustard seeds never seen around here before. ""I feel so happy in my heart,"" she said. ""I never thought I would have this itjara"" -- the Sesotho-language word for self-reliance. For Lesotho, the project is all about itjara; for South Africa, it is all about water. It was launched during the apartheid era -- with support from the World Bank despite official sanctions against white-ruled South Africa -- but has been embraced in the democratic era by the ruling African National Congress to help extend water supplies to millions among the long-oppressed black majority. Southern Africa's extreme climate variations make the region uniquely susceptible to droughts, yet few steps have been taken to store the region's available water. On a per-person basis, the heavily dammed United States stores 100 times more water than most African countries. Some critics say Johannesburg should address its water shortages by fixing leaks and reducing water use -- which has already begun to taper off because of the AIDS epidemic -- but water managers say conservation alone won't solve the problem. ""You can't run a metropolis of 10 million people without a reliable source of water,"" said Michael Muller, a top official at South Africa's Water Ministry. ""This was just the best deal for everyone."" But for environmentalists, anti-globalization activists and other opponents of megadams, the project is a stark illustration of the general problems identified by groups like the World Conservation Union, which concluded in 1999 that dams are ""the major cause of imperilment and loss of freshwater biodiversity."" The U.N. World Commission on Dams issued a similarly harsh report the following year. The highland project's critics complain that water rates have increased for poor South African blacks, that compensation for displaced Lesotho families has lagged, that community assistance programs have faltered and that the multination scandal makes a mockery of the World Bank's professed ""zero tolerance"" corruption policies. In his recent book, ""Unsustainable South Africa,"" Patrick Bond, a business professor at the University of the Witwatersand, called the project ""costly, corrupt, poorly designed, badly implemented, economically damaging, ecologically disastrous and distributionally regressive."" Even the project's own documents acknowledge problems with inadequate environmental planning and monitoring, initial training efforts that failed to provide marketable skills, and a now-defunct development fund that ""became highly politicized and lacked transparency."" In some ways, Makobile Lakabane has come to symbolize the project's drawbacks. She lives with her husband and seven children in a dingy stone hut the size of a wrestling ring. Their hillside village, Ha Seotsa, was once home to 50 farming and herding families, but it will be underwater once the Mohale reservoir fills up, and the Lakabanes are the only residents left among the town's ruins. The project built a new home for all her neighbors who wanted one, but the Lakabanes have been embroiled in a bureaucratic dispute about the ownership of their hut. So they live an hour's drive away, along a treacherous dirt road, far from any companions, with no school and few provisions, watching the water slowly rise. A Lesotho newspaper recently profiled the Lakabanes, bemoaning that ""the danger of being swallowed by the dam stares at them every second and moment of their lives."" A local human rights group, the Transformation Resource Center, has denounced project leaders who ""steal millions but can't build a house for this poor family."" On a tour of her abandoned village, though, Lakabane did not sound like an anti-dam radical. She was just upset that she hadn't gotten the same resettlement offer as her neighbors. ""We would be happy if we can be resettled like everyone else,"" she said. ""We want to be close to other things and other people."" In fact, project officials have now agreed to build a new home for the Lakabanes in a village of their choice, and the only remaining dispute involves $ 120 in moving costs. Overall, the project will displace only about 600 families. By contrast, more than 1 million people were in the way of China's Three Gorges Dam. ""I went to Lesotho expecting to hate the project, but it's not so bad,"" said environmental activist Steve Rothert, who once organized a meeting of local villagers and now works for the anti-dam conservation group American Rivers. ""The people there really don't have any other economic opportunities."" The good news, said Sister Catherine Lebina, is that the highlands project recently built a mortuary for her hospital in Manohau, a great sanitary advance for a region that has never had the means to refrigerate corpses before. The bad news, she said, is that the new mortuary is always full. ""This was a nowhere place before they built the dams,"" Sister Catherine explained. ""Then people with cash arrived in a place without cash. Girls started doing things for money. And so? AIDS."" AIDS has been an unforeseen consequence of the highlands project, spread by its truck drivers and construction workers as well as villagers with new access to the outside world. Sister Catherine said 80 percent of her patients are infected with HIV. One study suggested a 40 percent rise in HIV rates. But literacy rates are also rising, and waterborne diseases are declining. There are pros and cons to almost every element of the project. For example, it diverted 40 percent of the Orange River's flow, transformed the ecology of its valleys and wiped out nearby medicinal plants. But it also set aside two nature reserves, established the first botanical garden devoted to ""Afro-alpine flora"" and spent $ 2 million to save the endangered Maloti minnow. Similarly, the project had several development failures -- a recycling plant that sits idle, a soccer field washed away by a storm, a sanitation project doomed by rumors of snakes lurking in toilets -- but it succeeded in forming grazing cooperatives and promoting higher-value crops. Even the scandal has led to a landmark prosecution, with a Lesotho judge recently ordering a Canadian multinational to pay an unprecedented $ 2.2 million fine for bribery. Mahlape Mothepu, a top project official, was once a rural villager herself, rising every day at 5 a.m. to fetch her family's water. It is important, she said, to recognize problems caused by the dams. But she believes it's more important to remember problems that predated the dams. ""We've learned some bitter lessons,"" she said. ""But please remember why we're doing this."""15-Dec-02,ANGOLA (95%); UNITED STATES (94%); AFRICA (92%),"In poor countries blessed with oil, revenue from oil has a way of making most people poorer. The pattern is so pervasive and has been going on for so long that it has a catchy slogan: the paradox of plenty. No place has been more paradoxical for more years than Angola. It is potentially the richest country in Africa, with huge reserves of offshore oil and a population of just 12 million. Oil money, though, has bought decades of war, while giving Angolans a terrible standard of living. Although the war ended this spring, it's still not clear where the money is going (or even how much there is). In the past five years, $4 billion has vanished; meanwhile, the world spends about $200 million a year to feed poor Angolans. To break this cycle, in Angola and elsewhere, a simple idea has emerged this year. It also has a catchy slogan: Publish What You Pay. The World Bank backs the idea, as does George Soros, the financier and human rights crusader, as do 70 private aid agencies around the world. The Publish What You Pay coalition prods major companies to declare how much money they give governments in order to extract oil and minerals. If citizens know how much money comes in, they can, at the very least, figure out how much is stolen. Forcing transparency on corrupt governments would increase pressure on leaders to spend more on schools, hospitals and roads -- and might motivate citizens to toss out known thieves. Tony Blair, the British prime minister, gave the idea a boost this fall by calling on all companies involved in oil and mineral extraction to voluntarily announce how much they pay. But the Publish What You Pay coalition wants more. They want regulators of the world's richest stock markets, like the Securities and Exchange Commission, to compel oil companies to declare net annual payments to countries like Angola. None currently do. Most oil-producing states hate this idea. And oil companies fear losing billion-dollar concessions to competitors that will keep their mouths shut. This is not an irrational fear. When BP announced last year that it would publish its payments to Angola, the government threatened to cut the company off unless it ""scrupulously respects"" confidentiality laws. In all this, the Bush administration has been noticeable for not taking a leadership role. Forty percent of Angola's oil is exported to the United States. blaine hardend to cut the company off unless it ""scrupulously respects"" confidentiality laws. In all this, the Bush administration, has been noticeable for not taking a leadership role. forty percent of Angolas oil is exported to the United States. Blaine Harden"29-Dec-02,KENYA (99%); RWANDA (79%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%),"When Mwai Kibaki was injured in a car accident this month, he didn't seek treatment at his local hospital. He went to the airport and boarded a flight to London. Kibaki's injuries were relatively straightforward -- a broken arm and a sprained ankle -- but Kenyan hospitals just don't provide the level of medical care he wanted. His decision to go abroad was hardly unusual. Kenyans and foreigners who can afford to do so frequently travel to developed countries for health care. But Kibaki, 71, attracted more attention than most. He was running for president of Kenya, and his evacuation to Britain in the thick of the campaign was a stinging reminder of the painful lack of basic services in this East African nation of 30 million people. ""It's sad really,"" said Meshach Onguti, the new director of Kenyatta National Hospital, where overcrowding forces two and three patients to share a bed, and technology in the emergency room dates from around the late 1970s. ""Kibaki's decision to leave his own country for medical care, well, it's just this huge metaphor for the state of every service in this country."" Kenyan voters went to the polls on Friday for a watershed election that will end the 24-year rule of the loved, hated and omnipresent President Daniel arap Moi, who is barred under the constitution from running again. Partial results indicate that Kibaki's trip to London didn't hurt his candidacy a bit; the opposition leader appears headed for a landslide victory. If Kibaki indeed wins, he will inherit a seemingly endless list of problems to solve: not just inadequate health care, but a scarcity of jobs, a public education system in shambles and a shattered infrastructure of rocky roads, sporadic electricity and balky telephones. Some Kenyans wonder where he should begin; others say the answer is simple: End corruption. Nothing is blamed more frequently for the country's woes than rampant corruption and patronage. Kenyan political analysts say corruption is woven through every element of a society that has come to accept the inevitability of giving or getting ""a little something"" to get through each day. Kenyans regularly speak of being unable to get a job, proper hospital care, a driver's license, phone lines and even a chance to pay bills unless they bribe someone. ""Corruption is the key, really,"" said John Githongo local head of Transparency International, a corruption watchdog group with a special office in Nairobi. ""I mean, this country collects billions in taxes each year. And if you look at what the government does with it, it's not very much. ""We have in Kenya impunity towards corruption. Rwandans know genocide; we know corruption. And it has hurt us and held us back."" Under Moi, critics say, a system of patronage developed that favored a small percentage of the population -- police to teachers to the distant cousins of government ministers -- and provided nothing for the vast majority of Kenyans. For example, some blame the terrorist attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in 1998 and the Paradise Hotel in Mombasa last month on the fact that weapons can easily be smuggled into the country with a bribe. When phones don't work, the electricity goes out and roads become wracked with deep potholes, it is often the funds that are meant to maintain these services that get pocketed. It often takes a bribe to get a job or run a business. ""I tried to get a job. At one point I attempted to sell eggs. It all collapsed,"" said James Maato, 26, who has been unemployed for five years and sat listlessly at a city park one day recently. ""There was too much corruption. I couldn't get anything done. I had to hand out a bit of money, and I didn't have enough."" While few Kenyans question the importance of rooting out corruption, some are unsure if either Kibaki or his principal opponent, ruling party candidate Uhuru Kenyatta, is capable of doing it. ""They are going to have to clean up a big mess,"" said Sammy Wambua, a political analyst for the East African Standard, a major newspaper here. ""There [are] a lot of [people] at every level who will be working against them. It may take a very, very long time and a lot of desire to really do it."" Nevertheless, whoever wins will be under intense international pressure to commit to tackling the issue. Such international agencies as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are withholding hundreds of millions of dollars earmarked for Kenya until corruption is reined in. When the IMF suspended a $ 220 million loan in 1997, it said it was doing so because of ""absurd and arguably unnecessary donor rituals."" Leaders of Kibaki's National Rainbow Coalition have announced plans to form a national forgiveness and reconciliation team that would offer anyone charged with stealing money from the government a chance to avoid prosecution by giving the money back. They also said they would begin forming committees to combat corruption and patronage in the police department and the court system. ""Jobs will be given on merit,"" said Raila Odinga, an opposition leader. ""Jobs will no longer be given on the basis of someone's tribe or where they come from."" Kibaki has also said that if he wins the election, he will publicly declare his wealth -- something that Moi has never done. Watchdog groups have said Kibaki's idea could set a new tone toward stopping corruption in everyday life. The election campaign offered little hope, however, as candidates continued the practice of handing out money for what Kenyans commonly call ""our daily bread."" In the rural village of Mbeere, in the impoverished eastern section of the country, Kenyatta's sister gave out ""tea"" -- the euphemism for a bribe on Christmas Day. Families lined up for the equivalent of $ 2.50, in a country where most people live on a dollar a day. In response, the Daily Nation newspaper ran an editorial that warned Kenyans: ""Don't vote with your stomachs."" At Kenyatta National Hospital, examples of how corruption hurts every level of the institution's functions can be seen at every turn. Onguti, the new director, said he had to fire much of the staff for inefficiency and corruption. At the same time, the IMF has withheld health care funding since 2000 until the moribund Kenya anti-corruption authority resumes work. Both presidential candidates have said they would restore that unit. The hospital's bathrooms are dirty, with urine-stained floors and feces smeared across toilets, and nurses said they were told to pay for cleaning supplies with their own money. There is no MRI machine, and cancer patients have to wait three months or more for treatment because there isn't enough equipment. Conditions at other medical centers throughout the country are worse. In a country where 700 people die every day of an HIV-related illness, an HIV/AIDS clinic in Mombasa has only headache medicine and rubbing alcohol. ""The problem is, shall we say, misappropriation of funds and a lack of international money,"" said Ewoi Benguwn, a doctor at the Fatima Medical Clinic as she handed an aspirin to an AIDS patient. ""I mean, honestly, most doctors who work here won't get medical treatment in this country."" Editorial assistant Candice Miranda contributed to this report."16-Feb-03,KENYA (99%),"Until recently, Kenyans felt defeated and downtrodden as they watched their country's downward spiral of economic and social decay. But a political transformation with the defeat of Daniel arap Moi's handpicked successor in the country's first real elections, in December, has given them a new spirit that is best captured in a single word -- unbwogable. The bizarre adjective exists in no dictionary. It is a mixture of Luo, one of Kenya's many tribal tongues, and English. It was coined last year by a duo of Kenyan rap artists known as GidiGidi MajiMaji, whose song ""Who Can Bwogo Me"" has become the country's new national anthem. Based on bwogo, the Luo word for scare, unbwogable (pronounced un-BWOH-gable) translates roughly as unshakable, say the two twentysomething authors of the song. The two sing in their tribal language of their own travails. They did not set out to write a political theme song, but ""Who Can Bwogo Me"" caught on big during the recent elections, in which the opposition ousted Kenya's notoriously corrupt government after its 39 years in power. The song was blared at full volume at opposition rallies. ""I am unbwogable"" T-shirts were worn with pride. The term was picked up by strait-laced opposition politicians like Mwai Kibaki, now the president, who prefers jazz to rap but knew a good lyric when he heard one. Mr. Kibaki proved to be unbwogable at the polls, ushering in a new era of government in a country that had known the same leader, Mr. Moi, for nearly a quarter century. In his inaugural address last month, Mr. Kibaki included what appeared to be a sly reference to Kenya's No. 1 song. The crowd roared its approval. ""Now, all of us, both young and old, men and women, Kenyans of every group, every race, every creed, have embarked on a journey to a promising future with unshakable determination and faith in God and in ourselves,"" he said. He was more explicit recently when he sent his aides into stitches of laughter by quoting the rap song directly. ""We are unbwogable,"" he said. ""Nothing will defeat us."" The Dec. 27 election did not transform Kenya overnight. The economy is as sluggish as ever. AIDS continues to ravage the population. The infrastructure remains threadbare. But work has begun on turning the country around, and there is already one big transformation: Kenyans have begun holding their heads up higher since they sent the longtime governing party packing. ""Kenyans now believe the destiny of their country is in their hands,"" said Wahome Mutahi, a columnist for the country's largest newspaper, The Nation. ""Before, we had lost faith in ourselves. We had become subjects. The state machinery wouldn't allow us to think."" Kenya's police officers can certainly sense the difference. They routinely used to solicit Kenyans for bribes. Now, with increasing regularity, people are refusing. Sometimes, they chase down the offending officers. Once in a while, they catch them, pull the bills from their pockets and hand them out to the crowd. The new government has done much in its initial weeks in office to fuel the spirit of people power. Public land that was parceled out to ministers in the old government has been taken back by Mr. Kibaki's administration, including a large plot of forest that Nicholas Biwott, a former minister who came to symbolize the nefarious ways of the Moi era, had set aside as a memorial to his mother. The new government has also taken over a downtown skyscraper, once the highest in all of Africa, that the former governing party had turned into its private headquarters. Officials from the party, the Kenya African National Union, have sued Mr. Kibaki, contending that he was flouting the law in seizing it. ""The purported executive order is a flagrant disregard of long established law in this country,"" fumed Mutula Kolonzo, a Parliament member representing the party. But most people would say that the previous government adapted the law to suit its desires. This week, officials of the new government led journalists on a tour of the detention facilities hidden in the bowels of Nyayo House, the government building where tourists must go to extend their visas. The dingy cells were used to torture political dissidents during a crackdown by Mr. Moi after a failed coup attempt against him in 1982. The new government plans to turn the cells into a monument to the country's dark days. One of the detainees was Raila Odinga, minister of public works in the new government, who was tortured in Nyayo House both in 1988 and in 1990 as a result of his political activism. He recommends that the new government follow South Africa's example and set up a truth and reconciliation commission to deal with past wrongs. ""I feel as though the struggle has been worth it,"" he said outside the room where he had been interrogated. ""I feel as though the sacrifice made is not in vain."" Mr. Odinga is now trying to improve the country's run-down roads. Besides sending out work crews, he has begun scrutinizing contracts doled out during the old government, some of which appear to be wasteful and even fraudulent. In another departure, the new tourism and information minister, Raphael Tuju, recently turned down a broadcasting license that the government issued to his private firm, saying that accepting it would amount to a conflict of interest. Such a notion did not appear to exist in the old government. Mr. Kibaki, who broke with Mr. Moi a decade ago, has made his crackdown on corruption a broad one. A prominent judge, various businessmen and a schoolteacher have been among those hauled into court. The World Bank, which had been withholding tens of millions of dollarsin aid to Kenya because of corruption, has said it will soon allow the money to start flowing again. ""I've been struck by how much is changing in Kenya, how much is under way,"" said Callisto Madavo, the World Bank's vice president for Africa, who visited Kenya this week. ""There is excitement."" For the two young singers who captured the new mood in a song, fame is coming fast. Joseph Ogidi, 23, is GidiGidi. Jahd Adonihah, 24, is MajiMaji. Onstage, they wear oversize jeans and baseball hats turned backward. They could be rappers anywhere. But their lyrics are all their own. Many young Kenyan fans from other ethnic groups do not even understand much of what they are saying. Still, GidiGidi MajiMaji concerts are always sold out, and the duo's CD is selling briskly. Next month, they head off on a concert tour in the United States, where they will show off their energetic style and Luo pride to audiences from New Jersey to California that they expect to be made up mostly of homesick Kenyan expatriates. But unbwogable, they say, applies equally to everyone, everywhere, Kenyan or non-Kenyan. ""It means you can remove that fear in yourself and do anything,"" MajiMaji said. ""It's about self-confidence toward the challenges of life. We wrote it about our own struggles, but I guess it captured the mood of this whole country."" Kenya's New Theme Following are some lyrics from ""Who Can Bwogo Me,"" by GidiGidi MajiMaji. I am unbwogable I am unbeatable I am unsueable So if you like my song Take it from me Who can bwogo me I am unbwogable. Oh, you should remember great people, You should remember those who have helped you You should remember those who have uplifted you. I am unbwogable."17-Feb-03,UNITED STATES (92%); CHAD (92%); IRAQ (92%); CENTRAL AFRICA (79%),"J. Robinson West's Feb. 11 op-ed column, ""The Pipeline to Iraq's Future,"" rightly deplored oil-related corruption and called for transparency and accountability in managing Iraq's vast oil revenue. As he suggested, Chad offers the most promising model thus far devised for ending the scandalous failure of oil revenue to benefit the people of countries whose resources are being exploited. But Chad's revenue project doesn't rely simply on a ""World Bank-monitored system."" A condition for World Bank and investor approval of the $ 3.7 billion investment in the Chad-Cameroon project in June 2000 was passage by Chad's National Assembly of a ""Petroleum Revenue Management"" law. This law says, ""The direct income [i.e., dividends and royalties] shall be deposited in an offshore escrow account . . . at an international financial institution."" It also states that the purposes for which this income can be allocated are ""public health and social affairs, education, infrastructure, rural development . . . environment and water resources."" This law is open to monitoring -- indeed to scrutiny -- by the public as well as by private individuals and institutions. A similar measure, adopted by the Iraqi people, should be a top priority. It would confer an unprecedented degree of authority and legitimacy on efforts to manage that country's petroleum resources in a transparent manner that would ensure their availability for the benefit of the people.

But Kenya is not the place it was just a few months ago. The minister did not empty out the briefcase as his predecessors might have. Instead, he chased down its owner and threw him out of the building. In the old Kenya, it took a small bill to avoid a traffic ticket. A few coins might encourage a bureaucrat to process a form. Getting a telephone line meant slipping a stack of shilling notes into an outstretched palm. None of those petty transactions approached the graft in the country's executive suites, though. Manipulated contracts and other elaborate scams have shifted billions of dollars of public money into private pockets over the decades, various studies have shown. But in the nearly three months since Kenyans voted out the party that had ruled for the last 39 years, a significant change has taken place. President Mwai Kibaki has not managed to wipe out the dirty dealings that had become so deeply rooted during the long tenure of his predecessor, Daniel arap Moi. But in declaring ""a culture of zero tolerance to corruption,"" he has begun to turn the tide. ""Corruption has undermined our economy, our politics and our national psyche,"" Mr. Kibaki declared at the opening of the Parliament last month. ""It has undermined our most important institutions and tarnished our reputations as Kenyan leaders."" Throughout Africa, new governments typically vow to root out their predecessors' misdeeds. Making headway is another matter. Even in the midst of the current anticorruption drive, a police officer effectively asked for money recently at a traffic stop not far from Mr. Kibaki's presidential residence. A bureaucrat with a photograph of Mr. Kibaki hanging in his office suggested strongly that a few coins might prompt him to act more swiftly. At the state-run telephone company, an employee stretched out her palm. ""This huge beast called government has hundreds of thousands of people, and it takes time to change,"" said the government's new anticorruption chief, John Githongo, who until recently was a newspaper columnist and antigraft crusader. At least in the new Kenya, the police officer did not demand money, as he would have before. Instead, he talked about how poorly paid police officers were -- about $100 a month for his job -- and practically begged for a handout. The bureaucrat, despite some hints, never explicitly mentioned ""a little tea,"" the Kenyan euphemism for a bribe, and eventually did his job without one. ""Bribes are still changing hands, but it's being done very quietly now,"" said Mwalimu Mati, acting director of the Kenyan office of Transparency International, the private group that monitors corruption worldwide and listed Kenya as the sixth most corrupt country last year. ""What has changed substantially is the expressions of political will that were absent before. The president is talking about it. Ministers are attacking it."" Tainted officials, meanwhile, are falling rapidly. Chief Justice Bernard Chunga resigned after Mr. Kibaki set up a tribunal to investigate corruption accusations against him. The chief of the central bank, Nahashon Nyagah, and the government's top tax collector, John Munge, stepped down recently after a scandal involving a looted bank. Just what happened to the deposits is unclear, although many government agencies lost huge sums of taxpayer money in the collapse. The chief executive of the state-run Kenya Power and Lighting Company, James Gichuru, was also replaced. The company was losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year despite its monopoly on power supply and distribution. Worst of all, the lights in Kenya regularly went out. Mr. Kibaki has also ordered a thorough inquiry into what is perhaps Kenya's most notorious corruption scandal, the complex Goldenberg affair, which cost taxpayers hundreds of millions in the early 1990's. The central bank paid out the money to Goldenberg International in export credits for gold, diamonds and jewelry that turned out to be nonexistent. Hundreds of everyday Kenyans jammed into a conference room a few weeks ago to watch the start of the investigation, which is likely to involve some of the biggest names in politics, including people in Mr. Kibaki's own government. The scandal is widely blamed for sending Kenya's entire economy into a nose dive, throwing many people out of work. Mr. Githongo, who headed Transparency International before Mr. Kibaki tapped him to be an ethics adviser, said the new administration's inquiry would be a test of its pledge to follow the truth wherever it leads. ""The fight against corruption will not be credible if we focus on individuals,"" he said. ""With Goldenberg, we're saying: 'Hold on. We have a series of cases here that nobody understands. Let's have this commission of inquiry in which everyone can be called. If particular individuals provide information and that leads to certain people, that's O.K. But there is no list.' "" Although Mr. Githongo acknowledged that there would be delicate political realities to contend with in the investigations, he declared, ""There are no untouchables."" Mr. Kibaki is also seeking a law requiring an accounting of campaign spending in all of Kenya's usually corrupt political contests and a requirement that all politicians, himself included, declare their wealth. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund suspended most of their loans to Kenya in recent years because allocations were said to have been misspent under Mr. Moi. Mr. Kibaki has said he will meet the institutions' demand that the government create an independent anticorruption body. What many Kenyans wonder is whether Mr. Kibaki will eventually get aroundto pursuing his predecessor. Mr. Moi retired from office when the Constitution prevented him from seeking another term and handed power over to Mr. Kibaki, who was not Mr. Moi's choice but who won a resounding victory in elections in December. Even some of Mr. Moi's detractors say he ought to be left alone and given credit for stepping down. Prosecuting him, as Zambia recently did with its former president, would, they contend, needlessly divide the country. Others, however, say that going after big fish like Mr. Moi would send a powerful message. Mr. Kibaki's aides say they intend to set up a panel modeled after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa to expose the many human rights violations during the Moi years. As for economic crimes, they are to be investigated and prosecuted in an effort to return stolen assets to the people. ""The law will guide this process,"" Mr. Githongo said. ""No one is exempt. The former president is just an ordinary Kenyan now. The law applies to him -- and everyone else."""4-Jul-03,KENYA (79%),"Once upon a time, World Bank financiers viewed their mission in narrow terms: Lend money to poor countries to try to make them richer. The governments that borrowed the money might let a bribe determine who was awarded a contract, and money intended for new highways or hospitals was sometimes siphoned off for other purposes, such as buying weapons. But overall, bank officials said, a little bit of corruption was tolerable -- often necessary -- to make economic development work. They don't say that anymore. Responding to evidence that corruption impedes the progress of failing economies, the World Bank in the late 1990s began cracking down on the corrupt practices of its borrowers. ""The one thing I'm proudest of is our work on corruption,"" bank President James D. Wolfensohn said recently. Before he took office in 1995, Wolfensohn said, the bank considered corruption ""an issue of politics,"" as opposed to one of economic development. Now, ""it is now central to what we do."" Under Wolfensohn, the bank began participating in international efforts to fight corruption. It developed internal controls to audit its projects. It compiled a blacklist of nearly 100 companies and individuals banned from receiving bank-funded contracts because of bribery, theft or for breaking other rules. Since 1996, the bank has started more than 600 anti-corruption programs in nearly 100 countries, according to a published statement. Some observers of the World Bank -- which reported that it lent $ 19.5 billion of dollars in the year ended June 30, 2002 -- say it should be doing more to discourage the governments and companies it works with from misusing its money, which comes mostly from the governments of rich countries. The bank has continued to fund projects in countries where corruption is said to be rampant, such as Bangladesh. Only one country, Kenya, has been prohibited from receiving bank loans because of its government's corrupt practices, and that was temporary. Despite the blacklist, the bank sometimes has been reluctant to ban companies that violate its rules. Because many of the world's most corrupt countries are also among the poorest, the bank's new stance can force difficult choices between continuing aid to a country that needs it and cutting it to discourage corruption. Poor countries are also notoriously poor record-keepers, making auditing more difficult. ""No one says this is easy. It's a trade-off,"" said Peter Eigen, founder and president of Transparency International, a corruption watchdog group. ""You can't just have a simplistic link between the level of corruption and the level of funding. Some of these countries would really struggle without the bank's loans."" Eigen, who left the World Bank in 1991 when his pleas for a stronger anti-corruption stance were ignored, said he believes that under Wolfensohn the bank has made fighting corruption a priority. ""It's very hard to change a large organization like the World Bank, and they're still working through this,"" Eigen said. ""They were pretty bad, and allowed [corruption] to become a major problem. There's been a total change in policy, but to change from policy to total implementation is a long way to go. While I'd be hard pressed to say they've licked it, they are an enthusiastic and effective partner."" The U.S. General Accounting Office evaluated the bank's anti-corruption efforts and gave a mixed review in a June report. While it found that the bank had taken ""important steps"" toward reducing internal corruption, the agency also recommended further action, including a more extensive audit of whether the bank's loans are used for their intended purposes. The bank ""has a long way to go,"" said William Easterly, an economics professor at New York University. ""If the client is important enough geostrategically or one they want to cultivate in the long run, they will continue lending to them, despite long histories of corruption. They continue forcing loans down that pipe."" Corruption can take many forms, but it is usually defined as the misuse of public office or money for private gain. In the 1980s and early 1990s, most academic literature on economic development argued that corruption could help ""grease the wheels"" of a fledgling economy. But after several studies showed that corruption impedes development, many foreign aid programs began advocating ""zero tolerance"" toward corruption. The World Bank responded to the shifting conventional wisdom. Soon after Wolfensohn railed against the ""cancer of corruption"" at the bank's 1996 annual meeting in Hong Kong, the bank formed an investigative body to audit its loans and set up a 24-hour hotline to allow staff and members of the public to report allegations of corruption. In November 1998 the bank convened a ""sanctions committee"" to punish companies and individuals guilty of corruption. In 2000 it formed a ""department of institutional integrity"" to investigate allegations of corruption within the bank or in connection with bank-funded contracts. It also started working with anti-corruption groups that once were highly critical of its activities. With Transparency International, the bank supports anti-corruption efforts such as an initiative to better account for money lent to countries involved in military conflicts. To combat corruption, the bank can ban, or ""debar,"" companies that use bribes and other unethical means to secure contracts, or it can directly punish governments by denying or decreasing loans to those where corruption is rampant. World Bank officials cited a recent audit of an urban development project in Sulawesi, Indonesia, as an example of a successful crackdown on companies. A 2002 review of the project -- for which the bank provided money to improve water services, housing, sanitation, flood control, roads and transportation on the remote Indonesian island -- found widespread corruption in procurement. In April of this year, the bank debarred 15 Indonesian companies for various lengths of time. The bank has permanently debarred 93 companies, but provides no information about them beyond their names and where they are based. The list includes four local firms. Asia Construction, which the blacklist says is located in Delaware and Maryland, is out of business. Two other companies, Digidata and Knowledge Engineering, both of Virginia, are owned by David Riper, of Fairfax, whose name also appears on the bank's blacklist. He was accused of paying a kickback to a bank official to help secure a contract on a project in Nairobi. Riper declined a request for comment. One Washington company, International Access Corp., is debarred until 2004. An attorney for the company said in a prepared statement that the firm ""was not treated fairly"" by the bank but did not address the reasons for the bank's decision. Despite the lengthy list of banned companies, several critics say that simply targeting firms that don't follow the rules is not enough. ""The view of most economists is that all the money is really going into one pot,"" Easterly said. ""The government might refrain from stealing funds on a World Bank project, but compensate by stealing more from another project."" Instead, Easterly advocates cutting off countries whose governments have demonstrable corruption problems. In June, the bank announced that Kenya, an East African country making a difficult transition to democracy after decades of one-party rule, was approved for a new loan of more than $ 100 million. In the past decade, Kenya has temporarily been cut off from funding by the World Bank and its affiliate lending organization, the International Monetary Fund, because of widespread political corruption. As recently as May, a government official there was accused of taking a $ 100,000 bribe from a contractor in the Kenya Urban Transport Initiative Program, a bank project that was suspended in August 2002 because of charges of rampant bribery and embezzlement. In approving the recent loan, the bank cited several steps Kenya's new government took to combat corruption. Meanwhile, the bank continues to increase its lending to Bangladesh, a poor and densely populated South Asian country plagued by debilitating floods, which consistently ranks near the top of world corruption surveys. It is due to receive $ 554 million from the World Bank this year, and roughly the same amount next year, said Enrique Pantoja, a World Bank country officer for Bangladesh. The country's loan package for the previous three years averaged around $ 250 million a year, he said. ""Not all poor countries are equally corrupt,"" Easterly said. ""Why can't they do better at lending to those that do better?"" Other development experts point out that the level of corruption in a country is difficult to define and to quantify. Transparency International's index, which ranked Bangladesh as the most corrupt country in the world for 2002, measures the international community's ""perception"" of corrupt practices, which some say can be misleading. ""Bangladesh is actually a tricky case,"" said Steven Radelet, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development. ""The Transparency number has a few asterisks. It's based on fewer sources than the others. This is not Zimbabwe, not Nigeria. It's not a disaster, or a kleptocracy. They've made progress in a number of other areas like health care and family planning. So they're getting a big check this year. It's a judgment call."" Transparency International's Eigen said: ""Sometimes when companies start to take corruption seriously, more cases are uncovered. It gives the impression that they are more corrupt when they are actually doing better. The bank seems to be handling these cases well."" Anti-corruption advocates said they will be watching closely what has, up until now, been the most widely publicized case of corruption in a bank-funded project: the Highlands Water Project, a dam and power plant built in the late 1990s in Lesotho, a tiny mountain kingdom in southern Africa. Government authorities there charged several companies with various forms of corruption, including paying bribes to win contracts. The World Bank debarred several of the smaller firms involved, but one large multinational corporation, Acres International of Canada -- which in 2002 was found guilty of paying a $ 266,000 bribe to the project's head -- has not been punished so far. ""We are continuing to get legal advice on that,"" Wolfensohn said. ""It is still under review."" Staff writer Paul Blustein contributed to this report."10-Jul-03,KENYA (95%); AFRICA (94%),"The Neema Children's Center has disappeared into thin air, authorities here say, and so have other groups that claim to be fighting AIDS in this African capital. Neema, which means blessing in Swahili, last year presented the government a slick grant request outlining its work in helping AIDS orphans. There are an estimated 11 million children across Africa -- including a million in Kenya -- who have lost their parents to the disease. Many of them have been abandoned. Neema won about $14,000 from Kenya's National Aids Control Council, the body that coordinates the government's anti-AIDS campaign. The money came from a World Bank grant intended to finance grass-roots work on AIDS. But auditors for the council recently cut off funds to Neema after failing to find a single orphan who had benefited from its work. ""We could not identify any orphan who received anything,"" said Kassim Mambo, a spokesman for the control council. ""We couldn't find anyone who worked for Neema either."" As the death toll from AIDS mounts, more and more money is arriving from overseas to combat the disease. President Bush is touting his administration's three-year pledge of $15 billion in AIDS spending in a tour of Africa this week, and AIDS activists say that still more is needed to combat the epidemic. The money that is arriving, however, is more than sufficient to attract the attention of unscrupulous operators. Across Africa, fake AIDS charities, which often lack offices or phones, have sprung up. Experts say the impostors illustrate that while money is desperately needed to fight AIDS, so are programs to combat corruption and stimulate African economies. Fraudulent entrepreneurs must be offered more productive ways of making a living in AIDS-affected countries, they say, than deceiving the sick. ""Ever since AIDS arrived on the scene, we've had all manner of people, some with no professional expertise, trying to elbow in on the pandemic,"" said Frances Angila, the head of Kenya's oversight group for nongovernmental organizations. ""The potential for fly-by-night organizations is very high. Sometimes it is a man and wife. Sometimes it's a few cronies who had a beer in a pub and decided that having an AIDS organization would be a good thing."" Kenya's AIDS oversight body recently stopped financing four such groups, including Neema, although none of the organizers have been apprehended. Another 10 are under investigation. In addition, the government recently suspended several hundred more nongovernmental organizations that did not properly document their spending. Several dozen of the suspended groups focused on AIDS. Experts say the bad apples represent only a small percentage of the 680 AIDS-related nongovernmental organizations in Kenya and of the hundreds of other community-based organizations working to combat the disease. ""I feel hurt when I see money going to people who don't have any actual work at all,"" said David Sira, who founded Kenya Aids and Drugs Alliance in 2001. His group employs five people and works across the country. Mr. Sira said he has AIDS and understands how hard everyday life can be for those who suffer from it. ""I decided to educate people to reduce the stigma,"" he said. ""I personally was close to committing suicide because of how I was treated."" Not only are mom-and-pop operations accused of misspending. Kenya's National AIDS Control Council, which finances the country's AIDS fight, has itself been accused of mishandling funds marked for the disease. The anticorruption unit of the Kenya police is currently investigating the group to determine whether it misspent $250,000 during the observance of World AIDS Day in 2001. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which is doling out huge amounts across the developing world, still granted Kenya's government $37 million recently for its AIDS fight. Some of the money will go to the control council. But Jerry van Mourick, the regional representative of the global fund, said he has pressed Kenyan officials to track the money closely. ""We don't just write blank checks,"" Mr. van Mourick said in a telephone interview from Tanzania, where he was negotiating a $5.3 million AIDS grant. ""A very important principle of the global fund is we need some assurance that the grant monies are properly spent."" The change in political leadership in Kenya is giving him and other donors some hope of increased oversight. Mwai Kibaki became president in December, replacing Daniel arap Moi, who was president for 24 years and is said to have left office while the country was riddled with corruption. Mr. Kibaki has begun an anti-corruption crackdown which has, among other things, led to the investigation of AIDS spending. Mr. Mambo, the spokesman for Kenya's AIDS control council, disputes allegations that most of the money the council receives goes to staff salaries. In the last year, about 800 organizations have received funds, he said, on the basis of endorsements by community leaders. Only a handful, he said, were fraudulent. ""If some of the organizations are nonexistent or are not doing the work they were funded to do, NACC would be glad to receive those reports, and immediate action would be taken,"" Mr. Mambo said in a statement he prepared in defense of the National AIDS Control Council. Kenya's health minister, Charity K. Ngulu, who has led the fight against AIDS fraud, accused the control council of squandering millions of dollars through shoddy accounting and questionable contracting procedures. There appears to be a political dimension to her attacks because she is said to be seeking to have control of the council, now part of the president's office, transferred to the health ministry. But Ms. Ngulu insists that her campaign is about disease prevention, not increasing her fiefdom. No more contracts ought to be awarded, she said, to what she calls briefcase nongovernmental organizations, which operate out of some shady character's attache case."3-Oct-03,CHAD (95%); CAMEROON (94%); AFRICA (94%); CENTRAL AFRICA (93%); UNITED STATES (92%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%); FRANCE (55%),"The World Bank announced the inauguration of a new Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline on Thursday and promised to help prevent this project from leading to poverty and corruption as such projects so often have in other poor nations. In one of its biggest gambles, the World Bank broke precedent and put money into the high-risk $3.7 billion private oil project in an effort to prove that its development experts could reverse history and ensure that the new oil money could work for the benefit of all citizens of Chad and not just the elite. The pipeline represents the World Bank's single largest investment in sub-Saharan Africa. By supporting the project, the bank said it had helped ensure that oil companies did not abandon the pipeline, which crisscrosses some of the poorest and least stable countries in the world. Ali Khadar, the director for Central Africa at the World Bank, said, ""We have put into place components to channel earnings from oil to poverty reduction, for health, education, the rural sector and to protect the environment."" In an elaborate news conference connecting reporters and experts in Washington, London, Paris and Ndjamena, Chad, World Bank officials said that they would break the curse of oil that has brought misery to nearly every other oil-producing African nation. An oil consortium including Exxon Mobil, ChevronTexaco and Petronas, the state oil company of Malaysia, built the 665-mile pipeline and oil facilities on the Atlantic Coast and will reap more than 60 percent of the estimated $13 billion revenues over 25 years, according to World Bank estimates. But environment advocates and human rights groups have yet to be convinced. They said the project had failed to protect labor rights and human rights and had needlessly damaged the rain forest that the pipeline traverses through Cameroon on its way to the Atlantic Ocean. Indeed, the government of Chad spent some of its signing bonus from the private oil consortium on military needs before the World Bank interceded and stopped the spending on arms. Jon Sohn, the international campaigner for Friends of the Earth, said: ""Chad and Cameroon are failing on environmental, social and poverty alleviation grounds. Why is the World Bank using public funds to promote the oil business?"" Chad, which has a poor human rights record and is one of the world's poorest countries, will receive an estimated $2 billion over the coming years and that is expected to double the average annual income to $550 from $250 in the next three years, according to World Bank officials. ""The whole issue of good governance is essential,"" said Rashad Kaldany, the director of oil for the International Finance Corporation, which is part of the World Bank group. ""It was unprecedented that we got involved, but we wanted to see that the government created a revenue-sharing plan that was transparent with sufficient checks and balances -- if we didn't take some risks we'd never get anywhere."" In this first venture in an oil project, the World Bank lent $92.9 million to the Chad and Cameroon governments and helped arrange another $200 million in other loans. In return for its help, the bank worked with the Chad government to set up committees including all parts of the Chad government as well as local labor unions, human rights groups and other nongovernmental organizations charged with deciding how the oil revenue is spent and then ensuring that the revenue reached the intended beneficiaries. If the project succeeds, the officials said it may prove a model for other oil-producing countries, especially Iraq. African oil has taken on strategic importance in the Bush administration as it looks for alternative sources of energy. The Chad project won approval from President Bill Clinton in 1998. Susan Rice, who was then assistant secretary for African affairs at the State Department, said the administration was won over by the World Bank's plan to transform oil from becoming an instrument of corruption and exploitation into one to improve human rights and reduce poverty. ""After a lot of examination and study, from the humanitarian and economic points of view, we were intrigued with the notion that there was a way to come up with a structure that would prove to be a new and more enlightened way to do business,"" said Ms. Rice, who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Digging wells and building the pipeline may prove to be the easy steps. Now the World Bank experts must ensure that the money will lead to the construction of schools and health clinics as well as the reduction of poverty. ""We're not encouraged that this will work,"" said Ian Gary, Africa policy director at Catholic Relief Services and author of the group's report on the pipeline ""Trying to insert a technocratic solution into a country like Chad, with its fragile, corrupt regime, isn't an obvious solution."" In the report, Mr. Gary and his co-author, Terry Lynn Karl, said that the World Bank had offered the political cover the oil companies needed to go ahead with their project and had immediately triggered easier access to financing.

But on the West African Sao Tome islands, where a big influx of cash from crude may be just months away, fears are growing that the money may cause more problems than it solves. Jolted by a coup attempt linked to the promise of newfound wealth and surrounded by neighbors where oil has fueled chaos, many islanders wonder if their government is prepared for the shock. ""Unless we put things in some order now, this will be a total mess,"" said Carlos Tiny, a onetime presidential candidate in the former Portuguese colony. ""So far, things are not in order."" Time is short. The major U.S. oil company ChevronTexaco has said it was poised to win an offshore oil exploration bloc with a bid of $123 million, grabbing a chunk of one of Africa's hottest prospecting zones. For islands that typically export about $4 million worth of goods a year, much of it cocoa and bananas, oil fees represent vast amounts of money that could transform the economy. The islands simmer with intrigue, spurred by the increase in the financial stakes for those in office. Interest from foreign players in an estimated 6 billion to 11 billion barrels of crude has further muddied the waters of the island's volatile politics, putting a little-known backwater on the strategic map. The government says it is in control and preparing to manage the inflow of money, but the next few months may yield clues as to whether Sao Tome is ready for a better life or will succumb to the curse of so many oil-rich African states. The continent is littered with examples of how not to do it -- some just a few hundred miles from the volcanic peaks of Sao Tome, where many of its 140,000 people live without running water or electricity. Civil wars have wrought havoc in oil exporters Angola and Congo, while Nigerians -- jointly managing Sao Tome's exploration zone -- blame oil as the source of much of the corruption blighting their country. Anxious to learn from the mistakes of others, Sao Tome is working with the World Bank to set up measures to deal with the cash, such as creating a fund to smooth revenue flows and save money for when the oil runs out. Analysts say such funds are no panacea, potentially providing a tempting cash cow for greedy politicians or collateral for loans that can suck states deeper into debt. Aiming to discourage any attempt to embezzle the new income, Sao Tome's parliament plans to pass laws before the first payments for exploration rights come that will force the government to publish figures for oil revenue. Most islanders agree on the need for transparency, but several politicians worry that the plans may be undermined. So far, events on the islands suggest that dreams of oil wealth have aggravated tensions rather than soothed them. Army officers attempted to overthrow the government in July, saying they wanted to create a new one to combat poverty. No one was hurt, but the putsch revealed a streak of anger at the government for signing what the coup plotters regarded as flawed exploration contracts. ""At the bottom of it was oil,"" said Sabino Santos, a spokesman for the coup plotters who remains in Sao Tome under amnesty. ""Those who signed them should be punished. They are mortgaging our future. They drive big cars, and a few kilometers away people are drinking river water."" President Fradique de Menezes weathered the coup attempt with mediation in which Nigeria played a key role, but some islanders say he has lost support through a perception that he is placing close allies in control of the oil. Critics say he is trying to wrest management from a more established class of politicians. They cite his appointment after the coup of Tome Vera Cruz as minister of natural resources and his choice of Prime Minister Maria das Neves, who has constitutional responsibility for oil contracts. ""Expectations fed the coup, but the main source of instability is the president himself, including his erratic allegiances and decisions in the oil sector,"" said a senior oil official. ""As a result he is losing people. He is not as strong as before."" With the president apparently weakened, some observers detect a greater influence by Nigeria in the country's politics, where the prospect of oil has inflamed rumors of foreign meddling. As Sao Tome's partner in a Joint Development Authority for the oil exploration zone, Nigeria will take 60 percent of the revenue when the crude starts pumping."18-Feb-04,AFRICA (95%); CHAD (93%); CAMEROON (92%); SUDAN (79%); NIGERIA (79%),"As night fell and the bright lights of the brand-new oil field wrapped this hamlet in their golden glow, Neurmbaye Elie, a local farmer, pointed across the field before him. There, Mr. Elie said, just left of the blazing gas flare, under the streetlight, once stood the village initiation site. Animals were sacrificed there, spirits were supplicated, and the village boys became men. Then it became part of the oil complex, fenced in, a patch of earth not unlike the rest; the village got about $130 for it. Now, he worries. What if the spirits, displeased, sprang from that sacred ground and spread willy-nilly across the land? Oil is bringing big changes to Chad, some cultural, like the one Mr. Elie worries about, others practical, like the way the World Bank will be overseeing how Chad manages its new wealth. Chad, among the poorest countries in the world, is now Africa's newest petrostate. Its $3.7 billion underground pipeline, stretching 670 miles, began ferrying crude oil through neighboring Cameroon to the Atlantic coast last year. The pipeline is the largest single private investment in Africa. Because the pipeline stands to transform this landlocked country, for better or worse, Chad is under a special glare -- from the oil industry, global lending institutions and development groups. The investment has come with strings attached: the oil revenues are to be transparent, and the government is to use the wealth to better the miserable lives of its nine million citizens. A citizens' committee is to review all spending to see that it conforms to the law. If the rules work as intended, they could set a new model for how oil business is done in Africa. But if the usual corruption sets in, if democratic reforms are postponed, it will be just one more case of the spectacular misery that has befallen Africa's oil states, like Sudan, where oil greased the engines of war, or neighboring Nigeria, where living standards plummeted since oil production began 40 years ago. ''You're dealing with a government that's certainly not a model of governance,'' said Jerome Chevallier, who oversees the pipeline here for the World Bank, which partly financed the project. ''It's basically a high risk, high reward project. If you can use oil to lift Chad out of its extreme poverty, it's a win. The risks, of course we know.'' It is the World Bank's first foray into oil development, and early missteps since ground was broken in 2000 suggest that the risks are indeed formidable. When the group of oil companies offered a $25 million ''signing bonus'' four years ago, the government spent the first chunk on arms and another refurbishing ministers' offices. According to the oversight committee, one ministry tried to buy rice and millet at twice the market price. Another wanted six off-road vehicles. The oversight committee blocked many of those requests. ''We said, 'No, no, no guys, too much,'' recalled its chairman, Mahamat Mustapha. [His future as chairman is unclear; President Idriss Deby's brother-in-law was recently appointed to the committee.] This year, Chad will see its first share of oil royalties, about $100 million, an amount that will enlarge the government treasury by about 40 percent, virtually overnight. While this allotment will be closely watched, another $100 million from taxes and customs duties is entirely at the government's discretion. Certainly, there is no dearth of need. Electricity and water are beyond the reach of a majority of people here, and the average Chadian can expect to die before his 45th birthday. The per capita income barely exceeds $1,000 a year. Chad ranks 165th of 173 countries on the United Nations Human Development Index. Critics say it is foolhardy to expect a leadership dominated by one ethnic group (the president's) and with a record of repression and mismanagement to do anything but use its new wealth to crush opponents. They point to worrisome signs: the banning of an antipipeline protest, the temporary closure of an irreverent radio station, the execution of criminals after what critics believe to be incomplete trials. The most recent sign of trouble was a suggestion by supporters of Mr. Deby, a military ruler twice elected president, to amend the Constitution to allow him to run for a third term. ''For those who lead us, the law is just a piece of paper,'' said Dobian Assingar, head of the Chadian League of Human Rights and a member of the oversight committee. The government, for its part, points out that no country has ever opened its revenues to such scrutiny. ''I can only say: 'Wait. Wait until the revenues are spent,' '' said Tom Erdimi, the state's liaison to the project. No matter how the money is spent this year, Chad is certain to have more in its future. ExxonMobil has already found more oil, and a Canadian company, Encana, is busy exploring north of here. The World Bank says the government has agreed to apply similar oversight in the future. The government is also likely to demand a larger share of the wealth; its current 12.5 percent in royalties is paltry compared with what is reaped by Africa's oil giants like Angola and Nigeria. In Ngalaba, the farmer, Mr. Elie, remembered when the oil workers first started drilling in the middle of his village. The noise was so loud it was unlike anything people had heard before. Today, many villagers are unhappy about the payment they got for the oil under their land. Villagers and oil company representatives deliberated for weeks about how much the land was worth, driving up the price of each mango tree to $1,000. In the end, Chadian villages affected by pipeline construction received $6.3 million in compensation, an impressive amount by the standards of this country, but as some villagers note, a fraction of the investment made. Moreover, some complain, the one-time cash payment and the other changes that oil ushered in have done little to improve their lives. A few villagers have managed to use compensation money to put tin roofs on their huts. Other have spent their windfall on beer. But Mr. Elie pointed to the generally sorry state of his community. No school. No hospital. None of the things the villagers had hoped would come with oil, he said. The oil wells sprouted in the middle of millet fields, and the social landscape was transformed. A schoolteacher took a job as guard for an oil well. Prostitutes and bartenders trickled in from across Central Africa. Carpenters and tinsmiths flocked here too, looking for shipping crates and scrap metal. ''A poor man is always looking for work,'' Abdel Kadre Ahmat said from under his workshop, where he makes hoes, shovels and cooking ladles from the carcass of an air-conditioner, a patch of aluminum siding and a rusty sign. He did not know what the materials had been used for previously, but he did not much care. They were free and, in his hands, very useful. ''I just know it's their garbage,'' he said. ExxonMobil says that its compensation packages included schools and health centers for the most affected villages. At the peak of construction 10,000 Chadians got temporary jobs, the company says. The country's gross domestic product has shot up. The novel oversight system is a boon for oil companies. In a sense, it exonerates them: here is how much your government is getting, the oil companies can say to its destitute neighbors, and now it is up to the government to spend it wisely. That, said Ron Royal, president of the ExxonMobil subsidiary Esso Exploration and Production Chad Inc., has not stopped government representatives from beseeching the oil company for more: one asked for electricity, another an off-road vehicle. The president, a northerner, asked for a school in the north. Mr. Royal declined. ''What you have to get your mind around is having to say no to people and then explain why,'' he said. ''They see we have so much. 'Why can't you give a little?' Because there's a principle here. You've got this responsibility. We've got this responsibility.'' World Bank officials say the pipeline represents a singular opportunity for Chad to become a viable state, if not a wealthy one. Mr. Chevallier, the bank's project manager, said the people of Chad's oil country have indeed profited from contact with the outside world. Speed limits are now enforced on the red dust roads. Seat belts are compulsory. He called it the ''discipline of the industrial age.''

That ought to be a good thing. But unfortunately, oil production in African countries has often brought, instead of prosperity, greater poverty, destruction of the environment and violent conflict. All the more reason to wonder what will happen in Chad, a central African nation governed by a dictatorship best known for corruption and human rights abuses. The initial indicators are troubling. Soon after the project's official inauguration last October, the government closed down the country's only independent radio station, FM Libert, which had close ties to the country's human rights organizations. Then residents of the capital city, Ndjamena, witnessed the first public executions in more than a decade. According to Chadian human rights advocates, the brief trial of some of the executed was a sham -- a sad chapter in the power struggle within the oil sector -- and was meant to send a clear message to critical voices in the country to be silent or risk their lives. This oil project was supposed to be different, thanks to an innovative partnership between the World Bank and an international consortium led by Exxon Mobil Corp. The consortium made construction of the project dependent on the World Bank's participation as an insurance policy for its investments in a region that is a potential political powder keg. The World Bank, the single largest source of funding for development, co-financed the project, hailing it as a groundbreaking initiative in which oil wealth would be translated into direct benefits for the poor, while any damage to the environment would be repaired. Citizen organizations pleaded with the World Bank to postpone funding until Chad had built the capacity and established legal frameworks to ensure environmental protection, respect for human rights and transparent management of oil revenue. In response to these protests, the World Bank called for environmental studies, passage of a law in Chad to ensure transparency in the use of oil revenue and establishment of an oversight committee to monitor implementation of the law. These were indeed innovative and welcome measures. But Chadian human rights and development organizations feared that these good intentions alone were insufficient and called for more time to build government capacity. They also insisted on some solid demonstration of the government's commitment to reduce poverty. Their concerns were more than justified. During the construction period, the World Bank's  internal watchdogs and project monitors warned consistently about serious delays in capacity-building efforts, the lack of public health studies to monitor the spread of HIV-AIDS and other infectious diseases along the pipeline route, and the  failure to consider the project's regional environmental impact. Massive migration to the project area has disrupted local communities. Inflation has led to the threat of famine, and water and sanitation problems have endangered public health. Damage to crops, the contamination of water sources and the chronic problem of dust generated by the massive transport and construction activities have inflicted further suffering on an already impoverished countryside. Despite these serious problems, both the World Bank and Exxon Mobil continue to tout the Chad project as a model for investments elsewhere. The World Bank claims that the project is a prototype of a new kind of extractive program that benefits the poor. Time is running out for Chad, but it is not too late. Measures to mitigate the environmental and social problems can still be taken and have become more pressing as new oil is being discovered in the region and will eventually flow through the same pipeline. Most critically, now that oil revenue has begun to arrive in Chad, the World Bank must use its leverage to ensure that these funds will be used to improve the well-being of some of world's poorest people. It is also critical that information on the vast new oil exploration efforts being undertaken in great secrecy is made public. The World Bank's institutional slogan is ""Our Dream Is a World Without Poverty."" It should not allow the Chad project to turn this sentiment into a sad mockery. Korinna Horta is a senior economist at Environmental Defense in Washington. Delphine Djiraibe is the director of the Chadian Association for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights."13-Mar-04,CAMEROON (94%); AFRICA (94%); CHAD (93%); UNITED STATES (93%); GABON (79%); ANGOLA (79%); MIDDLE EAST (79%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%); NIGERIA (79%),"Oil executives who roam the red dirt roads here have started to call Chad the new Persian Gulf. But the citizens of this town of mud huts have nicknamed their community ""I'm Waiting,"" as in waiting for jobs, waiting for wealth, waiting for schools to be built, and waiting for AIDS drugs. Groups of men lounge for hours in front of their huts. They have come to Kome, 320 miles south of the capital, N'Djamena, from all over the region, hoping to get a job at the new plant where oil -- or, as they call it here, black gold -- is being pumped from the earth. The town of 1,004 people has swelled to more than 4,000. But there are few jobs. Instead, robberies have more than tripled since illegal immigrants and jobless men started flooding into the town in recent months. Food and rent costs have risen. Shoeless and wearing a torn shirt, Colette Asnodji, 38, showed how she must padlock the corrugated metal door of her hut of sticks and mud because the town turned wild with crime after oil began to flow last October. A consortium led by Exxon Mobil Corp. and including ChevronTexaco Corp. and Petronas of Malaysia has landed its towering oil derricks and warehouses smack in the middle of the rural African bush. The undertaking is part of one of the largest private investments in the history of Africa: a $3.7 billion underground oil pipeline that stretches 650 miles from oil fields in landlocked Chad through neighboring Cameroon and out into the Atlantic Ocean. Pipeline construction began in October 2000. The first oil tankers, with 950,000 barrels of crude, left Cameroon last October, bound for refineries abroad. With the United States looking to decrease its dependence on Middle East petroleum, Africa is quickly becoming a key supplier. The United States already imports 17 percent of its petroleum from sub-Saharan Africa. Within a decade, nearly a quarter will come from the lush oil fields of the continent, with Nigeria, Angola, Gabon, the Congo Republic, Cameroon and Chad as leading suppliers. Oil now represents 70 percent of African exports to the United States. But for many African citizens who live above the black gold, oil has not improved the quality of life. ""Inserting massive oil revenues into countries with weak institutions, poor track records on democracy and governance, and few countervailing forces in society is generally a recipe for disaster,"" said Ian Gary, an adviser to Catholic Relief Services and co-author of a report titled ""Bottom of the Barrel: Africa's Oil Boom and the Poor."" To that end, Chad, a country plagued by corruption and 30 years of civil war, has pledged it will be different. In return for the World Bank's help in financing the project, Chad has entered into a partnership with the bank, the first of its kind in Africa, to counter concerns that the country's petrodollars may be mismanaged. Under the agreement, most of the government's share of oil income, expected to average $100 million a year -- and increasing Chad's annual revenue by 40 percent -- will be kept in a London escrow account. The government has passed a law saying that 80 percent of the income will be used to finance education, health programs, infrastructure, water management and rural development. Ten percent will go to a fund to benefit future generations and 5 percent for development in the Doba oil-field area. A nine-member Revenue Management College made up of Chadians from civil society, parliament, the Supreme Court and government must approve disbursement of the funds. Last November, $6.5 million was deposited in the account from the first sale of crude oil, and in December the government approved its first budget incorporating oil revenue and submitted it to the Revenue Management College. But no money has been spent yet, according to Prime Minister Moussa Faki Mahamat. ""Expectations are numerous, and people are in a hurry,"" Mahamat said in an interview in Washington this week. But the government has spent $4 million of a $25 million signing bonus from the oil companies to buy weapons, officials have said. The government also can spend as it chooses the indirect revenue from the pipeline project, including taxes and customs duties. President Idriss Deby, meanwhile, is trying to change the constitution so that he can run for a third term, and his brother-in-law was appointed head of country's central bank, a position that puts him on the Revenue Management College. When the pipeline opened in October, local aid organizations held a silent protest and declared it a national day of mourning, even as officials of the Exxon Mobil subsidiary Esso Chad held a party with bands and speeches. ""You see, there are really crucial problems,"" said Theresa Mekombe, a citizen representative on the Revenue Management College. ""So far, the oil has done nothing to help us. Do you see any hospitals or schools being built yet?"" Four hundred temporary jobs were given out here. The company largely employs highly skilled Americans, who live in a secure compound. But several hundred Chadian workers are being trained in the United States and Canada for key positions, according to Esso Chad spokesman Miles Shaw. ""We expect that in 10  years, 90 percent of Esso Chad's staff will be Chadian nationals,"" he said in an e-mail response to questions. The company declined a request for an interview on broader questions. Shaw said that since the project began, the oil company had contributed more than $6.5 million for health, education, HIV prevention ads and environmental initiatives in Chad and Cameroon. In Kome, however, the main beneficiaries so far have been commercial sex workers and the village chief, who opened a popular bar for Americans called the Phoenix Club. American oil workers donated a generator to the club so they could play music, watch videos and make ice to keep their beer cold. Samantha NgoMaben popped on her hoop earrings, slithered into her purple faux leather pants and showed off her new tank top with its sticky Playgirls logo. ""They're all from my American oil boyfriend,"" cooed NgoMaben, a prostitute, as she pushed her head through the lace curtain covering the door to her tiny room. She pointed across the road to the oil fields. ""I have so many American boyfriends,"" she said. ""I tell the white Americans from Texas, 'Keep coming. At least you will make us girls rich.' "" With her 4-year-old daughter clutching her hand, Celica Bessong, an immigrant from the Central African Republic, admitted that she didn't have any stylish clothing. Yet. She pulled out three photographs of herself posing on a sofa in her underwear. She would use the photos to entice her American customers. ""We need the money,"" she said with a shrug. ""The truth is a lot of people didn't get the jobs they hoped for,"" said Miskine Magadi, the village chief, who also opened a maze of one-room attached huts behind the bar that the commercial sex workers rent. ""People here are suffering. They don't even have food to eat."" In a nearby village, Taraseem Pelagie, 35, said her 14-year-old daughter got pregnant because ""she wanted to make some quick money"" with a man they thought worked for the oil company. He had lied to her. ""We thought with the petrol we could have everything -- food, clothes, a better life,"" she lamented, standing outside her mud hut. ""There is nothing good coming from this oil. In five years, nothing will change."" Another woman, Ashta Salieh, said her husband had been given a job at the oil plant but  recently died  ofAIDS. He was making enough money to take a second wife, who was infected. Now Salieh worries she might have contracted HIV, too. Esso Chad has posted a billboard on an unpaved road that snakes into town. It shows a man kneeling in front of his wife and offers advice on how to achieve an AIDS-free petroleum zone: ""Be faithful to your wife. Avoid AIDS."" The company's package of news  releases said that at the peak of construction work on the pipeline, 10,000 Chadians received temporary jobs. There is also a DVD presentation titled ""Chad: A land of promise,"" which shows smiling oil workers and children herding goats and cattle ""in a way of life that has existed for centuries."""13-May-04,ANGOLA (99%); UNITED STATES (96%); UNITED KINGDOM (94%); AZERBAIJAN (79%); NIGERIA (79%),"In a reversal of a longstanding policy, the Angolan government will disclose some payments it receives from oil companies that do business there, making the southwest African nation the latest to respond to pressure to make such compensation public. An Angolan government official is expected to disclose on Thursday that the country is receiving $300 million from ChevronTexaco at a deal-signing ceremony in Washington with the company's chief executive, David J. O'Reilly, three executives with knowledge of the agreement said. The deal extends Chevron's outstanding rights to the shallow-water oil and gas field known as Block Zero through 2030. Angola and other developing nations have been under scrutiny from human rights groups, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the British government to reveal what they receive from oil companies for access to national crude reserves. Angola has been trying to strengthen ties with the United States and foreign investors, and the payment announcement would come in the middle of Angolan president Jose Eduardo dos Santos's three-day trip to the United States. He met with President Bush on Wednesday morning. The United States is the market for more than half of Angola's estimated production of 950,000 barrels a day. Angola's finance minister, Jose Pedro de Morais, disclosed the amount of the ChevronTexaco payment to Angolan media last week, and a spokesman for the oil company confirmed that an announcement was expected Thursday, but did not provide details. Mr. de Morais was unavailable for comment on Wednesday, a spokesman in Angola's Washington embassy said. What energy and mining companies pay governments for drilling rights has become a hot-button issue as resources in the developed world dry up. ''We are running out of places to find oil,'' said Karina Litvack, head of governance and socially responsible investment at ISIS Asset Management in London. Oil companies are starting to look for resources, she said, ''where the money the companies pay the government sometimes fuels corruption, instability or human rights abuses.'' By disclosing the amount it is being paid, Angola's government is setting ''a new standard for transparency,'' Ms. Litvack said. ''We are cautiously optimistic,'' said Ben Mellor, an official with Britain's Department for International Development. Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain started the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative, known as E.I.T.I., in 2001, and many international oil companies and shareholders groups have said they support the initiative's call for increased disclosure. Angola's decision to make public the money it is receiving from ChevronTexaco may represent a ''real turning point'' for the country, Mr. Mellor said. Nigeria and Azerbaijan had recently stepped up disclosure of payments they have received from foreign oil companies after receiving outside pressure. Angola, which emerged from nearly 30 years of civil war in 2002, is struggling with food shortages, a large debt, and high poverty and H.I.V. rates among its 10.8 million citizens. Human Rights Watch estimated that $4.2 billion in oil revenues were unaccounted for in Angola from 1997 to 2002. The government has said such numbers are misleading, but it is under intense pressure from outside agencies and foreign investors to provide figures. ''The goal is to make the government accountable for how it manages its resources,'' said Karin Lissakers, an adviser to George Soros, the financier and philanthropist. Mr. Soros supports Publish What You Pay, a campaign to encourage oil companies to disclose the payments they make to developing nations. Angola's expected announcement on Thursday is an ''important step,'' Ms. Lissakers said, but ''one hopes they will take the next step and adopt the E.I.T.I. standards for the whole sector.'' ChevronTexaco is the biggest foreign oil producer in Angola, and pumps about 400,000 barrels a day from the Block Zero field. The company operates Block Zero, and shares ownership with France's Total, Italy's ENI and Angola's government-owned oil company. ChevronTexaco is paying $210 million to sign the 20-year agreement, as well as $80 million to develop social programs in the region and another $10 million in production-related payments.  URL: http://www.nytimes.com"1-Aug-04,CHAD (92%); NIGERIA (79%),"The World Bank has helped finance exploitation of oil, gas, coal and other minerals in the developing world, mainly through its private sector lending arm, even though this has rarely advanced the institution's mission of reducing poverty. Indeed, it often makes poverty worse. Three years ago, the bank's president, James Wolfensohn, commissioned a panel of experts to investigate how the bank should deal with these extractive industries. The panel concluded that the bank should stop financing oil projects completely by 2008 and should immediately begin a policy of supporting oil or gas extraction or mining only in countries with a well-established rule of law and effective regulation to ensure projects are well run. The bank's management has already rejected these conclusions, instead promising it will take these issues more seriously when making such investments. The bank's board, which will make its final decision this week, is likely to echo that position. But the management response smacks of business as usual. While it would be unwise for the bank to use the word never, it should embrace most of the review's recommendations for ensuring that its projects help the poor. Saying never to oil financing is counterproductive, though it is understandable that some people should urge that out of anger and frustration. It has become clear that plenty of poorly governed nations, including Nigeria, Angola, Ecuador and Venezuela, would probably have been better off had they never discovered oil or other valuable minerals. The discovery of these resources usually foments corruption, prevents the development of a diversified economy, props up dictators and fuels wars. But simply pretending those resources were never discovered is no development strategy. The challenge for the World Bank is to figure out how to help nations in the developing world take advantage of their natural riches, while making sure the poor benefit from them. Chad, one of the world's poorest nations, exemplifies why the World Bank's presence is desirable in some cases, even absent ironclad rule-of-law guarantees. As a partner in the development of oil fields there, the bank has forced Chad's dictator to accept a plan in which revenues are held in escrow abroad and will be directly spent on health, education and road programs. A revenue oversight committee of citizens is monitoring the process. The early indications do not suggest all this will be accomplished easily. The president spent part of the signing bonus on arms and the revenue oversight committee will include his brother-in-law as one of its members. But at least the plan is a step in the direction of giving the people of Chad a chance to benefit from their natural resources. In other places, like Equatorial Guinea, oil revenues go straight into the dictator's pockets. Countries like Chad have so few opportunities to develop that it seems prudent to leave open the possibility of bank involvement in some cases."6-Oct-04,NIGERIA (98%); AFRICA (98%); UNITED STATES (93%); MOZAMBIQUE (79%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%); CAMEROON (79%); BOTSWANA (79%); UGANDA (79%); ANGOLA (79%); ZIMBABWE (79%),"Robert Guest, Africa editor for The Economist, is the author of ''The Shackled Continent: Power, Corruption and African Lives.''  When the price of crude oil hit $50 a barrel last week, sending ripples of anxiety around the world, analysts blamed a young Nigerian man with a machine gun and a speedboat. He is Mujahid Dokubo-Asari, a militia boss who is threatening to start a civil war and shut down the Nigerian oil industry, which is the fifth-largest supplier of crude oil to the United States. He will do this, he says, unless his people, the Ijaw, who live on top of Nigeria's oil fields, are granted autonomy. By ''autonomy,'' he means ''control of the oil money.'' Nigerian officials dismiss Mr. Asari as a gangster. But if so, he is a gangster who has friends in the ruling party and is taken seriously enough that Nigeria's president, Olusegun Obasanjo, felt obliged to sit down and negotiate with him last week. Mr. Obasanjo is a well-meaning fellow, but his job is made more difficult because he is surrounded by crooks. Nigeria, like much of Africa, ought to be rich but is miserably poor. The main reason is that rather than striving to create an environment in which their people can freely seek prosperity and happiness, most African governments have chosen instead to rob them. This culture of criminality has spread throughout the ruling class, down to the Nigerian border guard who threatened to beat up my driver last month if I didn't give him a dollar, to the bribe-hungry Cameroonian police officers who stopped a truck I was riding in 47 times in 300 miles. This corruption makes it hard to do business in Africa. Manufacturers need smooth roads, reliable electricity and efficient ports. But too often in Africa, the roads are craterous because someone has looted the maintenance budget, the power fails because the state monopoly utility company is staffed with politicians' idiot cousins, and the customs officers hang onto your goods for weeks in the hope that you will bribe them to hurry up. In only two African countries -- South Africa and Botswana -- is it relatively easy to do business, a recent World Bank study found. For bright, energetic Africans, it is often easier to get rich by joining the government than by creating honest wealth. That is why the debt relief proposal debated over the weekend in Washington by officials from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Group of 7 nations would be not be a panacea for Africa. Faster debt relief is a good idea for countries with relatively clean, pragmatic governments that pursue sensible economic policies, like Mozambique and Uganda. But debt relief cannot help the worst-governed countries like Zimbabwe and Angola because their leaders are likely to squander the money it frees up. In those places, extra cash props up despots. This is a more complex picture than many debt-relief campaigners will admit. It may be, as Oxfam complains, that Zambia cannot hire enough teachers because the monetary fund has told its government not to run too large a budget deficit. But that is not the whole story. The main reason Zambia is bankrupt is that it has been ruled with startling incompetence and venality; for example, its previous president, Frederick Chiluba, is facing multiple charges of embezzlement. Outsiders cannot fundamentally change the way Africa is governed. That is a task for Africans themselves, and some are rising to the challenge. In Nigeria, President Obasanjo has hired a team of technocrats to curb corruption by making the public accounts more transparent. They are doing their best, but one of them told me that probably no more than one powerful Nigerian in 20 supports the clean-up. That in a nutshell is why Africans are poor: their leaders keep them that way."2-Jan-05,LIBYA (98%); UNITED STATES (97%); NORTHERN AFRICA (92%); AFRICA (92%); RUSSIAN FEDERATION (79%); MIDDLE EAST (79%); ANGOLA (79%); EUROPE (79%); NIGERIA (79%),"For the first time in a decade, a new oil territory is opening up. Reopening, that is. American oil executives have recently been flocking to Libya, crowding the lobby of Tripoli's only luxury hotel and literally standing in line to meet local officials. The executives are bent on finding out whether this oil-rich North African country -- long walled off from foreign investment because of its anti-American regime and ties to terrorist organizations -- could become the next frontier for exploration. What the petroleum crowd is after lies hundreds of miles south of this enclave founded by Phoenician traders in the seventh century B.C., beneath a desert the size of Alaska that holds oil reserves estimated at over 36 billion barrels. That is enough to meet the daily imports of the United States for eight years. And that may be just a starting point. At a time when oil around the world is harder to come by, Libya is dangling the rights to explore and develop new sources of petroleum. The country holds the largest oil reserves in Africa, but as a producer it trails Nigeria and Angola. And, as every Libyan official inevitably points out, only a quarter of the country has properly been explored for oil. But that is where the problems start. Libya is a highly authoritarian state, fraught with tangled bureaucracy, rampant corruption and arbitrary enforcement of laws. Its regime is based on an elaborate fusion of socialism and Islam -- dubbed the Third Universal Theory -- that was Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's answer to both capitalism and communism after he took control of the country in the late 1960's. Such tribulations are nothing new for oil executives, many of whom have previously traveled to hostile and far-flung places around the globe in search of oil. They, along with other Americans, are certainly eager to do business here: the newly opened American liaison office said it receives more than 200 inquiries a week from interested companies. In the next few months, several dozen oil companies will be watching as the Libyan government unveils the winners of new licenses that have attracted intense interest from major and independent producers. The surge in oil prices in 2004 turned the spotlight on the urgency to increase global oil supplies. The price shock underscored the lack of sufficient production capacity around the globe, stretching producers to pump at their maximum to meet runaway demand. But for oil companies that must continually replenish their production with new reserves, the exploration options are narrowing. In the Middle East, home to the bulk of the world's known oil, most countries remain shut to foreign investors. In the United States and Europe's North Sea, production from mature fields is in decline. Even in Russia, considered by many to be the most promising energy supplier in the world, access is threatened as the government tightens its grip on the local industry. The last significant oil discoveries were made off the West African coast in the 1990's, and these are being produced. So executives are now paying very close attention to a country that until recently was synonymous with international terrorism and whose leader was once infamously called a ''mad dog'' by President Ronald Reagan. ''One of the most critical issues facing the oil industry today is access to new oil reserves, and Libya represents tremendous resources,'' said Clarence Cazalot, the chief executive of Marathon Oil in Houston. ''There are many, many people who are descending into Tripoli to talk to the same people we're talking to,'' Mr. Cazalot said during a 24-hour visit here to attend a business conference and meet privately with Shukri Ghanem, the Libyan prime minister. The spotlight swung to Libya in August of 2003 when Colonel Qaddafi took responsibility for a score of terror attacks, including the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103, which killed 270 people over Lockerbie, Scotland; he agreed to a $2.7 billion settlement with the families of the victims. That was followed by a deal in late 2003 with the United States and Britain in which Libya promised not to develop weapons of mass destruction. The announcements paved the way for the United Nations to lift sanctions against the country. But hurdles abound. The country remains on Washington's list of state sponsors of terrorism, which limits the exports of some technologies that American oil companies need for their work. Corruption is another problem. In its latest survey, Transparency International, an independent organization in Berlin that monitors corruption, ranked Libya 108th out of 145 countries, tied with Albania, Argentina and the Palestinian Authority. The lower down a country ranks on the list, the worse the country's corruption, according to the survey. The country still seems ill-equipped to deal with the influx of foreigners. Recently, a high-level representative from the World Bank, Yukiko Omura, who was scheduled to deliver a speech here, was denied entry at the airport because of problems with her visa. ''That's not such a good start,'' one European business executive said. ''They should be courting her, not deporting her.'' Three decades of competing socialism, Islam and tribal rule have damaged Libyan society. More than half of the country's workers are employed by a sprawling state bureaucracy, joblessness runs about 30 percent, educational standards have sagged, and Libyans complain they have to travel to neighboring Tunisia to get proper medical treatment. As a result, foreign investors remain cautious, said Randel R. Young, a lawyer who advises oil companies about Libya for Fulbright & Jaworski, an international law firm. And questions remain about whether the regime has really abandoned its old ways. Libya is suspected of being involved in a recent plot to assassinate Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah because he traded insults with Colonel Qaddafi during an Arab League summit in 2003. ''People are treading their toes carefully,'' Mr. Young said. ''With such a country, it would be surprising if there were no uncertainties.'' Most oil executives seem undaunted. ''We feel comfortable enough to put our money down,'' said James LeJeune, a vice president for business development at ChevronTexaco, who was visiting Libya to consider investments here. ''In any other country, that would fall under acceptable risk.'' In small ways, Libya has changed. Visitors at Tripoli's airport are greeted by revolutionary slogans for a classless society, but they can now buy French perfumes or Italian sunglasses at the recently opened duty-free shops. The airport plans to offer Internet connections for travelers. Around Green Square, Tripoli's main public area, the oversized pictures of Colonel Qaddafi that once adorned the white facades of colonial buildings are slowly giving way to ads for Pepsi Cola or Korean-made consumer products. And last year, the regime opted for a drastic change of course. Colonel Quaddafi appointed an American-educated economist as prime minister, tacitly encouraging him to loosen the state's grip, privatize government-run companies, and allow market forces to shape the economy. These policies amount to a complete reversal of its 1969 ideology. ''It was clear that the government's ways weren't successful anywhere,'' said Shukri Ghanem, the prime minister, who is considered a traitor by the regime's revolutionary die-hards. Despite having the backing of Colonel Qaddafi, Mr. Ghanem, who holds a Ph.D. from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Medford, Mass., acknowledged that his plans still face opposition from security services and revolutionary committees which he has little control over. ''Some people have privileges which they hate to see changed,'' Mr. Ghanem said in an interview in his office in the center of Tripoli. ''Lots of people prefer the status quo to having a shot in the dark.'' The item that tops his agenda now is the redevelopment of the country's oil industry, the cornerstone of his government's economic program. Libya's oil sector has slumped since the early 1980's. It currently produces about 1.6 million barrels of crude a day, a level that has remained mostly unchanged during the last decade. That production is less than half the peak of 3.3 million barrels a day reached in 1970. Libya's National Oil Company wants to return production to that peak level by 2010, and has estimated that it needs $30 billion in investments to expand and modernize the nation's oil industry, drill new wells and build pipelines and refineries. The country has been getting some outside help since the 1990's from European oil companies like Italy's Eni, Spain's Repsol and France's Total. These account for about 20 percent of the country's oil production. Libyan officials said that they should be able to attract big American oil companies and increase the share of foreign involvement to 50 percent of Libya's oil output. ''Libya has a big room for increased production,'' said Mr. Ghanem, whose face lit up as he listed his country's advantages as a producer. ''Libya is west of Suez, close to Europe and closer to the United States'' than Persian Gulf oil producers. ''It's unexplored and has good-quality oil.'' Libya is a relative late-comer to the Middle East oil boom. Oil was only discovered here in 1959 by Standard Oil of New Jersey, as Exxon was known at the time. By 1961, Libya was exporting its first crude; 10 years later, it ranked among the world's top 10 oil producers. But Colonel Qaddafi's regime, which toppled King Idris in 1969, put an end to the oil bonanza. Investments fell as the new government imposed tougher fiscal terms on foreign companies. While government revenue initially rose as oil prices soared, production soon slumped. Exxon and Mobil, then separate companies, withdrew from the country in 1981 as tensions between Libya and the United States grew. In 1986, the remaining companies left when President Reagan ordered American oil interests out of Libya before bombing the country. Now, these companies -- Occidental Petroleum and a group made up of Marathon, ConocoPhillips and Amerada Hess, known as the Oasis group -- are negotiating their return to their original oil concessions. But some executives are cautioning that increasing production will take time. ''You can't simply flip a switch,'' said Casey Olson, a vice president at Occidental, the fourth-largest oil company in the United States. ''It's a step-by-step process.'' Mr. Olson was one of a handful of American oil executives who traveled to Libya in recent years to inspect their original oil assets under a special waiver from the State Department. He said Libya has a lot of catching up to do after missing out on most of the industry's technological advances in the last two decades. Tony Mills, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, an oil consulting firm in Edinburgh, Scotland, said that Libya seemed intent on regaining a front-row seat within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. In the 1970's, Libya was one of the group's biggest hawks, pushing for increases in oil prices and leading the charge for the oil embargo that followed the 1973 Arab-Israel war. The country's future intentions are unclear, but first it needs to become a major supplier again. ''Libya,'' Mr. Mills said, ''realizes it can matter again now that it has the world at its door.''

''Nothing would be more satisfying than to feel at the end of however long a term I serve here that we played a role in changing Africa from a continent of despair to a continent of hope,'' he said Tuesday at his first news conference. To underline that commitment, he will travel to Africa in June. Mr. Wolfowitz becomes the 10th president of the bank, the world's largest development organization, at a time when experts are again asking basic questions about what works in pulling countries out of poverty. One of the few things most development institutions agree on is the need for a large increase in development aid. The United Nations and the World Bank under James D. Wolfensohn, the departing president, have called for the world's rich nations to double the aid given to the poor. After meeting with most of the bank's own experts over the last two weeks and reading dozens of books on the debate, Mr. Wolfowitz said he was relieved to be taking over the institution at a time when people are willing to experiment and exhibit ''a certain open-mindedness. ''There's been a healthy change in the development approach,'' he said. ''It's no longer one size fits all.'' Surveying the array of issues tied up in the goal of reducing poverty, Mr. Wolfowitz said he would emphasize finding solutions in partnership with the countries involved; ensuring that women have the same opportunities as men; restoring the bank's role of building structures like roads, ports and bridges in poor countries; and coordinating the bank's efforts with other donors and institutions. ''The best approach is to put the people in developing countries in the driver's seat,'' he said, adding that this often requires humility and patience. He also singled out corruption as a major problem in development. ''Corruption is the biggest threat to democracy since communism,'' he said. Mr. Wolfowitz comes directly to the World Bank from the United States Defense Department, where he was the deputy secretary and involved with the Iraq war, with its divisiveness. He said he hoped to leave the Pentagon behind him in his new job. His arrival, however, has been greeted with a letter of protest signed by 303 groups from 62 countries. And he said he has had to convince skeptics within and outside the institution that he will not use the World Bank to pursue the foreign policy agenda of President Bush. ''I'll do that by being objective and credible,'' he said. Mr. Wolfowitz said, however, that it has been far more common for foreign officials to ask him if he could help them out with his special access to the White House or Congress. Mr. Bush nominated Mr. Wolfowitz for the position in March and he won unanimous approval from the World Bank's board. The United States has named all of the bank's presidents since its founding as part of the United Nations system, a practice that is coming under increasing criticism. Africa will dominate Mr. Wolfensohn's work over the next months. After returning from his trip, he will attend the annual meeting of the Group of 8 industrial nations in Scotland in July. Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, the host, has placed Africa at the center of that agenda, and Mr. Wolfowitz has closely studied the report that Mr. Blair's commission on Africa prepared for the session. The report's recommendations include abolishing many of the agricultural subsidies of rich nations, increasing aid to Africa by $25 billion and strengthening protection of the environment, policies that are at odds with the administration and many in Congress. His reading list also includes: ''Why Globalization Works,'' by Martin Wolf; ''The World's Banker,'' by Sebastian Mallaby; ''Development as Freedom,'' by Amartya Sen; and ''Voice for the World's Poor,'' a collection Mr. Wolfensohn's speeches. Added to that pile of reading material was a thick study released on Tuesday by the Center for Global Development, a nonpartisan institute, listing the five tasks it says Mr. Wolfowitz needs to accomplish."12-Jun-05,"AFRICA (95%); UNITED STATES (94%); UNITED KINGDOM (93%); SCOTLAND (79%); RWANDA (79%); BURKINA FASO (79%); JAPAN (79%); MOZAMBIQUE (79%); RUSSIAN FEDERATION (79%); ZAMBIA (79%); CANADA (79%); ETHIOPIA (79%); BENIN (79%); SENEGAL (79%); GERMANY (79%); FRANCE (79%); UGANDA (79%); MAURITANIA (79%); MADAGASCAR (79%); NIGER (79%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (79%); GHANA (79%); MALI (79%)","The world's wealthiest nations formally agreed Saturday to cancel at least $40 billion of debt owed to international agencies by the world's poorest lands, most of them in Africa. After late-night talks in London, the finance ministers of the Group of 8 industrialized nations announced that the deal, long in negotiation, had been intended to avoid damaging the ability of international lenders like the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund to continue helping other poor countries. ''This is a historic moment,'' said John W. Snow, the United States Treasury secretary, one of the participants. ''A real milestone has been reached.'' The deal on Saturday was expected to ease the 18 poorest countries' annual debt burden by $1.5 billion. They are Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guyana, Honduras, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. All must take anticorruption measures. Gordon Brown, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, asked at the news conference whether debt relief was also conditional on good government practices by the recipients, said part of the deal was for poor countries to use the money they saved on debt servicing for health, education or the relief of poverty. The agreement came after months of negotiations in which the United States had been pressing the other Group of 8 countries -- Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Japan and Russia -- to agree that the solution to poor countries' indebtedness was to cancel their debt burden completely rather than seek simply to ease it by taking over interest repayments. ''It is my hope today that this reform will conclusively end the destabilizing lend-and-forgive approach to development assistance in low-income countries,'' Mr. Snow said. In the future, he said, ''grants would be used to ensure that countries do not quickly reaccumulate unsustainable debts.'' The agreement, which followed talks in Washington this week between President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, was struck less than four weeks before the Group of 8 leaders hold a summit meeting at Gleneagles, Scotland. Mr. Blair is the current chairman of the Group of 8 and has placed the relief of African poverty along with global warming at the head of an ambitious agenda. Advocacy groups and charities have pressed for a deal on debt relief for years and some welcomed the agreement on Saturday, saying it cleared the way for a broader announcement on combating African poverty at Gleneagles. ''We want a comprehensive breakthrough on more, better development assistance as well as trade reform at Gleneagles and with debt mostly taken care of we can keep up the pressure for a large package,'' said Seth Amgott, a spokesman for a coalition of American charities and advocacy groups called ONE. Some other groups noted that 44 more countries were still burdened by debt to international lenders. Britain is also pressing for a doubling of international aid to Africa, but it is not clear whether that goal will be reached before the Gleneagles summit meeting. Significantly, a statement by the Group of 8 finance ministers did not formally exclude other initiatives to fight poverty, including a tax on airline tickets proposed by France and Germany and a British proposal to raise money for poverty relief on international financial markets. Both of those ideas are opposed by the United States, but their inclusion seemed to be part of a trade-off to secure agreement on the cancellation of debt. Asked about American opposition to an aviation tax on Saturday, Mr. Snow said, ''Our position is the same.'' Mr. Brown said Group of 8 countries had agreed to compensate the World Bank and the African Development Bank in particular for forfeiting interest payments on poor countries' debt, so those groups would have the income to make new loans to other countries. ''We could not contemplate a situation,'' he said, where debt cancellation for some poor countries was made at the expense of other poor countries. The United States agreed to pay up to $1.75 billion in compensation to international lenders over the next 10 years, while Britain agreed to pay up to $960 million. Other Group of 8 countries made their own, undisclosed pledges; more pledges are expected from other members of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund this year. Mr. Brown said the agreement on Saturday would immediately affect some $40 billion in debt, including servicing costs. But the amount it will actually cost the Group of 8 to compensate the international lenders is $16.7 billion -- a calculation based on the payments the international lenders would have expected to receive from 18 debt countries between now and 2015, the officials said. Over all, international lenders are owed some $55.6 billion, Mr. Brown said. The finance ministers said Group of 8 members would compensate the World Bank and the African Development Bank for their losses. But the International Monetary Fund would be able to use ''existing resources'' of its own to cancel the $6 billion it is owed by poor countries. Mr. Snow said this would require ''no use of gold'' -- rebutting proposals by Mr. Brown for the I.M.F. to sell or revalue gold reserves to finance debt cancellation."19-Jun-05,AFRICA (95%); SCOTLAND (93%); UNITED KINGDOM (93%); UNITED STATES (92%); EUROPE (92%); RWANDA (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (71%),"The breakthrough on debt relief to 18 of the world's poorest countries grabbed world headlines this month, but with only two weeks to go before the richest nations again take up the woes of the world's poor, this time at a summit meeting in Scotland, two more consequential issues loom: aid and trade. While the debt deal, which was reached June 11 at a meeting of finance ministers in London, will free the World Bank and 18 poor countries from decades of futile haggling, it will generate relatively little new money to fight poverty -- about $1 billion a year. That is just a bit more than one percent of the aid that rich countries gave poor ones last year, and a tiny fraction of the aid increase that Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain will be looking for when he plays host to the Group of 8 industrialized nations at the meeting, which begins July 6 in Gleneagles, Scotland. Mr. Blair is seeking a doubling of aid, which would include an extra $25 billion for Africa alone. The worry among some of those advocating a huge new infusion of aid is that euphoria about debt relief will relieve pressure on leaders of rich nations to do more. ''The G-8 meeting is make or break in mobilizing resources for Africa,'' said Kevin Watkins of the United Nations Development Program. Over the past year reports from Britain, the United Nations and the World Bank have argued that, yes, African countries do need to root out corruption and improve the management of their economies -- but also that they need much more money to help pay for clinics, schools, medicines, roads and other investments to help millions of Africans stay alive, get an education and earn a living. The 15 major nations of the European Union, which already give most of the aid to poor countries, decided in May to almost double what they contribute within five years. The Bush administration has declined to make a similar commitment, skeptical that poor countries can productively spend such a large increase. And the likelihood that American aid will grow as much as even President Bush would like seemed to dim further last week. Republican leaders of the House Appropriations Committee had already set a goal for foreign aid spending for next year of $20.2 billion, $2.5 billion less than President Bush requested. (The amount appropriated last year was $19.7 billion.) And even Mr. Bush's own priorities are vulnerable. On Thursday, the subcommittee that oversees aid almost halved the $3 billion Mr. Bush had requested for one of his signature initiatives, the Millennium Challenge Account, which is charged with providing grants to well-governed poor countries. John Scofield, a spokesman for the House Appropriations Committee, noted that Mr. Bush's proposed spending on aid increases faster than spending on homeland security or defense. ''That's a tough sell in Congress,'' he said. Trade is also a crucial issue for developing countries -- and it will be on the G-8 agenda in Scotland, though the red-letter dates this year are in December at a World Trade Organization meeting in Hong Kong. A few statistics suggest the importance of trade to poor countries: Rich countries spent $280 billion last year subsidizing farmers and agribusiness -- more than triple the $79 billion they spent on aid. Those subsidies reduce prices for agricultural goods on international markets, making it harder for farmers in poor countries to compete. If all trade barriers were removed and agricultural subsidies were eliminated, developing countries would gain $100 billion in income, according to World Bank estimates. As the G-8 summit talks approach, those pressing for increased aid are trying to put the extra billion in resources from debt relief in perspective, and to remind the leaders of rich nations that what they believe the poor regions of the world need is a fairer trading system and more aid. ''These are countries that need grant financing to build infrastructure, fight disease and grow more food,'' said Jeffrey D. Sachs, the Columbia University economist. ''These are countries that have nothing. People are dying.''

Within days, the White House reported the resignation of Paul Applegarth, the chief executive of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, who, with an entire world of poverty, disease and wretchedness to consider, managed to find only two countries worthy of aid. His office says his departure had ''absolutely'' nothing to do with the complaints lodged last week by the presidents of Botswana, Ghana, Mozambique, Niger and Namibia, who told Mr. Bush that the bureaucracy and fine print of the program made it nearly impossible for them to get aid. We're just glad Mr. Applegarth is going, and hope President Bush appoints a successor more interested in actually giving money to poor people. To see just how badly the Millennium Challenge program has performed, compare it to the Fast Track Initiative for financing education, which is run out of the World Bank. Both programs came partly as a result of the Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations, which commit all member countries to meet a set of quantifiable targets for combating poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy, environmental degradation and discrimination against women by 2015. Both programs use the same basic model: rewarding poor countries that demonstrate a willingness to reform with big increases in aid. Both programs were announced in 2002. Since then, the Millennium Challenge program has signed contracts to give money to only two countries: $108 million to Madagascar and $215 million to Honduras. The program's board recently approved two more, Nicaragua and Cape Verde. Through the Fast Track program, rich countries have actually given money to 12 countries. During the first three years, donors shifted about $905 million in foreign aid to the qualifying countries for primary education; this year the 12 countries will get an additional $350 million. No sane person expects the rich countries to assume the entire burden for eradicating poverty, although this is the first generation with the wherewithal to do so. But poor countries are at a crossroads, particularly in Africa. Tired of corrupt governments and self-defeating civil wars, which have depleted resources even as they laid waste to entire ethnic populations, Africans have been standing up to say ''enough.'' Even by the strict standards adopted by President Bush's Millennium Challenge program, which requires that governments meet all sorts of anticorruption, pro-growth criteria to qualify, there are plenty of countries where a big infusion of measurable, quantifiable aid would be put to good use. The issue will reach a critical point next month in Scotland, where Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain plans to push the Group of 8 industrialized nations to commit an additional $25 billion for Africa. President Bush has yet to endorse Mr. Blair's proposal. This is a good time to make a fresh start, and demonstrate to the world that America can still be a moral leader. The next head of the Millennium Challenge program should seize the role with gusto. That means taking Congress to task for not fully financing the program, something Mr. Applegarth could not do with any credibility since it was not as though he was actually handing out any money to poor countries anyway. It means lobbying hard within the administration for more money for development initiatives. And finally, it's not necessary to reinvent the wheel. One reason the Fast Track Initiative got going quickly was that it did not waste years in assembling a staff of neophytes who narrowly defined strategies for growth to fit their ideological bent. The Millennium Challenge program granted $108 million to Madagascar for, of all things, land-titling, bank reform and agribusiness centers. Those are worthy endeavors, but this is a country where many villages do not have running water, clinics or schools. Bank reform is fine, but real growth cannot exclude the basics. Malnourished people are not going to make good businesspeople or farmers. And they are certainly not going to be asking for directions to the bank."19-Jun-05,AFRICA (96%); SOUTH AFRICA (94%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (92%); RWANDA (79%); BURKINA FASO (79%); ZIMBABWE (79%); NIGERIA (79%),"The World Bank needs to streamline its bureaucracy and refocus its lending on rebuilding decaying infrastructures in poor nations, the bank's new president, Paul A. Wolfowitz, said Saturday at the conclusion of his first visit to sub-Saharan Africa. At a news conference with South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, Mr. Wolfowitz said African leaders' commitments to address corruption and misfeasance had opened new opportunities to combat poverty in this, the world's poorest region. But he acknowledged that future lending would have to be better managed. ''There is increasing recognition that the reason they have these debts is that a lot of governments in the past didn't spend that money well -- and that's an understatement,'' he said. ''You know what I'm talking about, corruption.'' He praised Mr. Mbeki, who recently dismissed his deputy president after a trial linked him to a bribery scheme, for leading efforts for better government in the region. In his first trip abroad as president of the bank Mr. Wolfowitz spent six days in Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Rwanda and South Africa, much of it visiting rural areas to see first-hand the region's needs. Earlier, Mr. Wolfowitz condemned Zimbabwe's uprooting of hundreds of thousands of slum dwellers, calling it inhuman and saying it must damage the country's development prospects. ''It's a tragedy,'' he said."6-Jul-05,AFRICA (97%); NIGERIA (95%); UNITED KINGDOM (93%); UNITED STATES (92%); SCOTLAND (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (50%),"One of Dora Nkem Akunyili's lowest moments as a corruption fighter came about two years ago when her son told her not to visit his boarding school. Obumneme Akunyili, age 13, did not want anyone to know that she was his mother. It was not out of shame. Since becoming Nigeria's top food and drug regulator in 2001, his mother had broken the back of an illicit trade that had flooded Nigeria with fake medicines. She had taken on importers, distributors and an array of officials willing to risk Nigerian lives for a bribe. But her son feared what might happen should her enemies track him down. So he told everyone that his mother was an aunt. ''That caused me a lot of pain,'' Mrs. Akunyili said. ''He denied I was his mother. But the young boy saw the danger.'' In Nigeria, even children understand corruption's menace. Increasingly, so do the donors that have poured more than $300 billion into African nations since 1980 -- and watched too much of it vanish into a sinkhole of fraud, malfeasance and waste. Now the efforts of reformers like Mrs. Akunyili are being scrutinized at meetings where donor countries consider aid to Africa, as leaders of the Group of 8 industrialized nations will do this week at Gleneagles, Scotland. The summit meeting has been billed as a turning point for Africa, where the billions have begun to flow again. Foreign aid to the continent reached a 17-year low in 1999, but in May, the richest nations agreed to write off $40 billion in loans owed by the world's 18 poorest countries, all but four of them in Africa. No African nation points up the challenge quite like Nigeria, a country that is both hampered by corruption and trying to control it. Awash in oil and gas that has flooded its treasury with $300 billion in the past 20 to 30 years, Nigeria remains utterly destitute, in no small part because of waste and graft. Officials like Mrs. Akunyili have scored some victories, but few corrupt officials have been convicted and millions of aid dollars still go astray. So donors are confronted with the question in Nigeria, as in much of Africa, of how much improvement is enough. Corruption has not only robbed Africa of money to help lift some of the world's poorest people out of poverty. Around the world, it has also stalled economic development and tarnishes people's faith in government and, often, democracy itself. The host of the summit meeting, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, wants to double global aid to Africa to $50 billion a year by 2010. Although he appears unlikely to reach that goal, aid is clearly on the rise: both the European Union and the United States propose to double their assistance during that period because African nations are lagging further behind their industrialized counterparts and richer nations fear that failed states can become breeding grounds for terrorism. And while the United States devotes less of its wealth to foreign aid than the other nations at the talks, it has already tripled aid to Africa since 2000. But this new giving is increasingly dependent on proof that its recipients are controlling corruption and governing wisely. Mr. Blair's Commission for Africa, which he established last year, concluded in a report in March that ''without progress in governance,'' including tackling corruption, ''all other reforms will have limited impact.'' The United States has been even more blunt: ''Countries like ours are not going to want to give aid to countries that are corrupt or don't hold true to democratic principles,'' President Bush said last month after meeting with South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki. That this tough-love approach is rapidly becoming conventional wisdom is one measure of the turnabout in the approach to foreign aid since the cold war, when both sides showered cash on African allies with scant regard to how much was stolen or wasted. Still, how high to set the good-governance bar -- and deciding who clears it -- is in the eye of the donor. Jeffrey D. Sachs, a Columbia University economist who wrote a December 2004 report to the United Nations on fighting poverty, said that at least two dozen poor nations, many in Africa, are well-enough run to manage a rapid infusion of aid. The Bush administration's Millennium Challenge Account, set up last year to promote economic growth in poor countries, says just seven impoverished African nations qualify, with another six on the verge. There is ample fodder for pessimists and optimists alike. On the positive side, a growing number of African nations are edging away from crime and autocracy toward democracy and openness. Ghana, which marked its first peaceful democratic transfer of power in 2000, is often cited as a regional model of reform. Tanzania's president, Benjamin Mkapa, claims that an anticorruption campaign has led to a four-fold increase in government revenue in the decade since the nation's first multiparty elections. Zambia is trying its former president, Frederick Chiluba, for stealing $488,000 in state funds -- even though he handpicked the successor whose government has charged him. Crucial Role for Donors  Yet a May study by the World Bank found that between 1996 and 2004, the quality of governance deteriorated in as many African countries as it improved. Kenya is a painful illustration: a government ushered in two years ago on an anticorruption platform saw its widely respected anticorruption czar quit in frustration in February, apparently because his work was thwarted. The United States and Germany quickly withdrew nearly $10 million in aid. Whether the new wave of African aid avoids the pitfalls of the past depends not just on its recipients, development specialists say, but also on the donors, who have often pushed poorly devised projects, refused to coordinate their efforts or demands with one another and failed to monitor the impact of their largesse. Foreign aid must be tied to teaching poor nations how to build accountability into their governments, development specialists contend. In some countries, it is not even clear whether the executive branch or the parliament controls the budget, said Steven Radelet, a senior fellow for the Washington-based Center for Global Development. He warned, however, that such improvements typically require generations to take root. Nigeria is one of many nations where aid has been wasted, or simply stolen. Lagos, home to 15 million of Nigeria's 137 million people, is among the world's most troubled cities, replete with open sewers, foul tap water, garbage-strewn roads and traffic that perennially seems at a standstill. Not including World Bank loans, which in some years totaled as much as $1 billion, Nigeria took in $3.5 billion in aid from 1980 to 2000. That was a few hundred million less than Sani Abacha has been accused in news reports of stealing in the five years he ruled Nigeria as a military dictator before his death in 1998. Dismayed, donors pulled back or out. Aid in 1999 totaled half the 1990 level. Later audits disclosed scores of botched projects financed with hundreds of millions of dollars in international loans. Nigeria's government never even cleared the site for an $18 million construction project. Millions were spent on paper mills that never produced any paper. Eighteen projects costing $836 million were never completed; another 44 either never operated or were quickly shut down, the Nigerian Finance Ministry reported. Of 20 other projects started between 1985 and 1992, more than half had little impact or were unsustainable, the World Bank concluded. But with the 1999 election of Olusegun Obasanjo, donors' enthusiasm reawakened. Mr. Obasanjo's anticorruption credentials seemed impeccable: he helped found Transparency International, an anticorruption group, and strongly backed a program by African leaders to review each other's adherence to democracy and good governance. Since his election, aid to Nigeria has doubled. Yet Mr. Obasanjo's first term ended with little progress. ''He wanted a second term, and he believed that if he took the anticorruption war too seriously, they would make sure he didn't get a second term,'' Jibirin Ibrahim, a political scientist and director of Global Rights, a Nigerian pro-democracy group, said of corrupt officials. ''Which was a strategic mistake, because these people were able to further entrench themselves in the system.'' Now, with two years left in his second term, Mr. Obasanjo's crusade appears to have regained steam. In recent months, his education minister was arrested for bribing legislators. His housing minister was fired for selling government property at cut-rate prices. And the police inspector general was led away in handcuffs on charges of money-laundering. Some early initiatives also appear to be bearing fruit. Oby Ezekwesili, a senior aide to the president, said the government had saved $1.3 billion since the start of 2003 by insisting on competitive bidding in awarding contracts. But the list of unfinished business is formidable, including removing the constitutional guarantee of immunity for the nation's most senior officials and opening government records to the public. Bribes and Bottlenecks  Other obstacles remain. Although Mr. Obasanjo's first act as president was to establish an anticorruption commission, the office has secured just two corruption-related convictions among the 85 people it has charged in its five years. Mustapha Akanbi, a retired judge who heads the commission, said he suspected that some judges have been paid off to toss out cases. Government officials have also resisted change. After investigators uncovered bribes to a hospital medical director, Mr. Akanbi said, the health minister refused to fire him until Mr. Akanbi complained personally to the president. ''Every single step you take, there are bottlenecks,'' said Mike Sowe, the commission's spokesman. When Mrs. Akunyili took over as director of Nigeria's National Agency for Food and Drug Administration four years ago, perhaps four-fifths of her agency's regulators were corrupt, she said in a recent interview. Even worse, two in three drugs sold publicly were either unregistered or unsafe for consumers. Mrs. Akunyili knew the danger well: her sister, Vivian, a diabetic, died in 1988 after what she believes was an injection of fake insulin. Every few weeks, Mrs. Akunyili's agency made a show of burning heaps of fake drugs collected at airports, seaports, illegal factories and distributing houses. A spot check last year showed the impact: only one in eight drugs was unregistered. Major pharmaceutical companies have now returned to Nigeria, and other African nations have agreed to lift their bans on Nigeria's drugs. Doctors were among the most grateful. ''We know the drugs are real now, because the patients don't come back with the same symptoms,'' said Sister Josephine Ngama, a senior doctor at Ancilla Catholic Hospital on the outskirts of Lagos. ''People had been trading in these fake drugs for years.'' Honored and Imperiled  Mrs. Akunyili has been showered with awards, but her family is pressing her to quit. Seven months after she took office, 10 armed men invaded her home, leaving only after learning that she was not there. In December 2003, armed gunmen attacked her car. A driver in a nearby bus was killed. One bullet went through Mrs. Akunyili's blue headdress, grazing her skull. ''It's like a war,'' she said. ''They are fighting back.'' Reformers like Mr. Akunyili stand out partly because they are so rare. ''Hopefully, they are going to do enough good that people are going to be attracted to them,'' said Victoria Kwakwa, the lead economist for the World Bank here. ''It is going to have to start with small groups, because you don't have the base. If you did, you wouldn't have gotten to this point to begin with.''

Its economy had collapsed; its ruler was an indicted war criminal whose business partners included financiers of al Qaeda and Hezbollah. On Tuesday Liberians peacefully went to the polls for the first fully democratic election in the history of a country established in 1847 by freed American slaves. Twenty-two candidates, ranging from warlords to former officials of the World Bank and United Nations to an international soccer star, competed for president. A bicameral legislature also was to be chosen, under the protection of 15,000 U.N. peacekeepers. The results won't be known for a few days, and a presidential runoff might be necessary. Still, that voting could take place in a country infamous for much of the past 15 years for drugged child warriors, mass rape and one of the world's most despicable dictators is itself an extraordinary political breakthrough  --  and a tribute to the international rescue operation led by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. It is nevertheless a great understatement to say that Liberia still has a long way to go to reemerge as a sovereign and stable state. Despite two years of relative peace under a transitional government, it still lacks the basics of a modern government or economy. There is no electric grid, no piped water, no school system. Many of Liberia's sources of income, from forestry to rubber plantations, remain under the control of warlords. Most government revenue is stolen. Tens of thousands of demobilized combatants wait restlessly for jobs or schooling. Liberia's donors have backed a novel and far-reaching solution to this first set of problems: a form of trusteeship under which the new government will be required to accept internationally appointed representatives in state companies, ministries and the judiciary. The appointees will share control over national revenue and spending, while foreign judges will ""support and advise"" Liberian courts as they take on political corruption cases. Liberia signed an agreement accepting the controls before the election, and the leading presidential candidates have announced their support. But the post-election implementation will be critical, as will the willingness of donors  --  including the United States  --  to provide money for basic reconstruction projects in exchange for the micromanagement. Reconstruction, however, is not Liberia's biggest challenge. The inspiring elections ultimately will accomplish little unless they lead to the disempowerment of former dictator Charles Taylor, who from his exile in Nigeria still seeks to regain power and meddle in the affairs of Liberia's neighbors. Prosecutors of a U.N.-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone that indicted Mr. Taylor for war crimes have accumulated abundant evidence that he has violated the terms of the asylum he was granted in 2003 by the Nigerian government. Nigeria has resisted taking action, but has said it would respond to a request from a new Liberian government. Intimidation by Mr. Taylor may make that a tough decision. But the new Liberian president should nevertheless insist that Nigeria deliver the dictator to the Special Court. Only when Mr. Taylor is brought to justice will Liberians be sure that their recovery is real."10-Nov-05,LIBERIA (96%); SENEGAL (79%),"Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the economist who hopes to become the first woman to be elected to lead a modern African nation, opened a large lead in the race for president of Liberia as votes were tallied Wednesday in the country's first election since emerging from a 14-year civil war. With nearly 60 percent of the vote counted, Ms. Johnson-Sirleaf, who was educated at Harvard, had an 11-point lead over George Weah, the former soccer star who was favored to win because of his broad popularity with Liberia's young electorate. Mr. Weah won the first round of voting last month, which winnowed the field to 2 candidates from 22, by about eight percentage points. International observers said the voting appeared to have been free and fair, but Mr. Weah rejected the vote tallies, saying at a news conference that there had been widespread irregularities. With a stack of what he claimed were false ballots for his opponent in hand, he said he planned to challenge the results. After the news conference he addressed hundreds of supporters at his campaign headquarters, who greeted him with chants of ''No Weah, no peace.'' On Tuesday, Mr. Weah claimed that he had won 62 percent of the first round of voting but that cheating had whittled his share to 28 percent. Ms. Johnson-Sirleaf, a former United Nations and World Bank official who had long been a stalwart of opposition politics in Liberia, made a strong showing, leading in all but 4 of Liberia's 15 counties. With most of the votes counted in the vote-rich capital, her lead appeared to be commanding. ''Things are looking very good,'' said Morris Dukuly, a campaign adviser to Ms. Johnson-Sirleaf, in a telephone interview. ''We are winning by a substantial percentage.'' The new president will face rebuilding Liberia after more than a decade of civil war, which ended in 2003 when Charles Taylor, the warlord-turned-president, was forced from office by a rebel insurgency. His departure brought an end to years of on-and-off fighting, which was fomented by Mr. Taylor and spread to Liberia's neighbors, killing hundreds of thousands. Liberia was left with no electricity or running water, and few roads or schools."12-Nov-05,LIBERIA (94%); UNITED STATES (92%); EUROPE (92%); NIGERIA (79%); AFRICA (79%),"Supporters of former Liberian soccer star George Weah clashed with U.N. peacekeepers Friday in the capital after results of a presidential runoff election showed his apparent defeat by Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, a former World Bank official. The peacekeepers wielded swagger sticks and shot tear gas canisters into the air to disperse hundreds of people who had gathered near the U.S. Embassy, alleging that the vote had been rigged. The demonstrators held up signs that read ""Where's our vote?"" and ""We thought you wanted peace."" Some of the protesters threw rocks the size of tennis balls at the peacekeepers, but no serious injuries were reported. Outside the European Commission office next to the embassy, Acarous Gray, who described himself as a ""youth advocate"" for Weah's campaign, issued a manifesto condemning the vote. ""It's about the downtrodden masses,"" he shouted over the cries of the crowd. ""We want a leader. We don't want a ruler. Until we get the redress we want, we will demonstrate 24 hours a day."" With more than 90 percent of the votes counted, Johnson-Sirleaf, a former finance minister, had won 59 percent of the vote to Weah's 41 percent. International election observers have said the voting was largely free and fair. Weah's campaign alleged numerous voting violations and has asked the Liberian Supreme Court to stop the vote counting. Geoffrey Rudd, charges d'affaires in Monrovia for the European Commission, part of the International Contact Group on Liberia  that is overseeing the country's transition to democracy after 14 years of civil war, said Weah had detailed his charges of fraud in a letter. ""We have written back to him . . . saying he should follow the due process, and we will support him in the due process,"" Rudd said. ""We asked him to have patience."" Johnson-Sirleaf, who would become Africa's first democratically elected female president if the results are certified, claimed victory Friday. The results ""show me with a commanding lead. There's no way that can be reversed,"" she said in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. ""The young people have a right to express themselves. They're doing so peacefully,"" Johnson-Sirleaf said, adding that she was eager to ""start the process of renewal and rebuilding."" The demonstrations began after a few thousand Weah supporters had gathered at his dusty campaign headquarters. Many in the crowd, made up mostly of young men, denounced Johnson-Sirleaf for her past support of former president Charles Taylor, who presided over the country's decline in the 1990s and is now in exile in Nigeria. ""We will never fight war again, we want peace,"" said a young man who identified himself as S. General Kobakay, 35, a former opposition fighter who had battled Taylor's forces. But if Johnson-Sirleaf is certified as president, ""We will say no,"" he added. Weah, who has little political experience, addressed his followers in a short, sober speech. ""The streets of Monrovia don't belong to violent people,"" he told the boisterous crowd, which quickly fell silent. ""Do not, in the name of peace, go in the streets and riot."" Minutes after Weah's speech, some in the crowd marched toward the U.S. Embassy, where they said they intended to ask the Americans for help in investigating the fraud allegations. Many in the crowd waved tree branches symbolizing peace, and most did not engage in the clashes near the embassy. Oliver Yarbah, 25, a sociology student at the University of Liberia, said he marched to the embassy to prove the power of peaceful protest. ""The voice of the people is stronger and mightier than any weapon,"" he said. ""What is being recorded here is the most peaceful demonstration in the history of Liberia."""13-Nov-05,MALAWI (97%); SOUTHERN AFRICA (79%),"Bending at the waist, Awine Bingolosi scratched the dry earth with quick strokes of her hoe, chopping away weeds and arranging the soil into long ridges. One day soon, the weathered, wiry grandmother planned to plant corn seeds in neat rows, just as her parents used to do. And after a long day in the field, Bingolosi said, she would pray as she often does: ""Oh God, forgive us our sins. Please give us rain this time. We are suffering."" This is agriculture, Malawi-style  --  tiny in scale, carried out without benefit of machines or animals and utterly dependent on the unpredictable weather. It is why a country blessed with fertile soil, nearly constant sunshine and abundant water has become one of the most consistent recipients of international food aid, even as some of its neighbors have become at least occasional exporters. An estimated 5 million of Malawi's 12 million people are hungry this year, according to the United Nations. Hospitals also report higher rates of malnutrition and, with the harvest still five months away, unusually large numbers of hungry children are beginning to sicken and die in rural areas. Malawian agriculture once appeared to have a brighter future. A state-run farm agency, although widely criticized as overbearing, sold reliable supplies of seeds and fertilizer and guaranteed prices for whatever was grown. And for a time, the government actively sought ways to build irrigation networks drawing on the mighty Shire River that flows through the dry, destitute valley south of Blantyre, Malawi's commercial center. But in the past 20 years, under pressure from the World Bank and donor nations, Malawi has liberalized its agricultural economy and dismantled the state-run agricultural system. The government's clumsy implementation of this change has led to complaints from farmers such as Bingolosi about the market's failure to deliver a more efficient and bountiful harvest. The government has also sold off state food reserves at times, leaving nothing for emergencies. Meanwhile, various water schemes have remained on the drawing board. Today less than 1 percent of this southern African nation, roughly the size of Pennsylvania, is irrigated, and that land mainly belongs to commercial farms that grow tea, sugar and tobacco for export. Bingolosi sees little hope for change from a government embroiled in a bitter power struggle. Opposition lawmakers have tried to impeach President Bingu wa Mutharika for alleged corruption and misuse of funds, and his leading parliamentary critic was arrested on Nov. 2. ""The government of nowadays, they are busy only with politics,"" said Bingolosi, who appears to be in her fifties. ""They can't think of bringing irrigation."" Like many Malawians, she also expressed the belief that things had only grown worse since the late dictator H. Kamuzu Banda was voted out of office in 1994 after three decades of often oppressive rule. ""He used to keep enough food for the people of Malawi,"" Bingolosi said. ""We never had a crisis like this one."" According to aid workers, researchers and government officials, Malawi's failure to advance from its status as one of the world's poorest, sickest and least developed nations stems from the tiny plots that produce roughly the same amount of corn per acre as they did in 1964, when the country won its independence. While the population has more than tripled, 85 percent of Malawians remain subsistence farmers, struggling to survive with primitive means and extremely vulnerable to devastating food shortages in years when the rains come too early, too late or barely at all. The contrast with some other southern African nations is vivid. Although the U.N. World Food Program has had to deliver aid to six drought-stricken nations in the region this year, most of that food is bought in South Africa, where mechanized and irrigated farms regularly produce surpluses of corn. Malawi's struggling neighbors, Mozambique and Zambia, have also exported corn in some recent years, but both will receive aid this year because of the drought. Even in the impoverished Shire Valley, a South African company runs a lush, 30,000-acre sugar plantation that uses huge amounts of water from the Shire River every day for irrigation, with energy provided by hydroelectric dams. The plantation employs 7,000 workers and has enough extra water to support extensive landscaping and a small golf course. But company officials said they had no interest in switching from sugar to corn, which after years of government price controls is seen as unprofitable in Malawi. ""To grow maize as a commercial crop, it's not viable,"" said Irene Phalula, a company spokeswoman. ""We wouldn't make anything out of it."" Today, Malawi resembles the arid West African nation of Niger, which is suffering from a systemic food shortage of its own. Both countries are dependent on the most rudimentary forms of agriculture and cannot afford to import enough food to make up shortfalls. Both also have rapidly expanding populations and liberalizing economies that have failed to provide promised benefits. Pauline E. Peters, a Harvard University anthropologist who studies Malawi, described the government's agricultural policy as ad hoc and politically driven. ""They basically destroyed the public systems . . . expecting the private market to leap into place, which of course it didn't,"" Peters said. The country had a heavily regulated agricultural system, and it was dismantled quickly. At the same time, the steps needed to create a successful market system, such as establishing sources of credit and merchant groups to provide seeds and fertilizer, were not taken. Discontent with the handling of economic liberalization is widespread in Malawi. The government's secretary for agriculture, Randson Mwadiwa, said international donors and the World Bank had rushed Malawi into sharply scaling back the old system before it could build a new one. He said the state-run system had stabilized prices and distributed a steady supply of corn seeds and fertilizer deep into the countryside. In recent years, Mwadiwa said, international donors have been generous in providing emergency aid during food shortages. But he said development aid for irrigation, or even fertilizer and seed, had been inadequate. Several aid groups are investing in foot-pump irrigation systems to bring water to crops, but officials acknowledged that the scale of the project was nowhere near what is needed to end Malawi's chronic food shortages. With the help of international donors, Malawi expects to spend 5.7 billion kwacha  --  about $46 million  --  on food aid this year. ""Imagine if we had 10 billion kwacha set aside in one year for irrigation,"" he said, the equivalent of about $80 million. ""Even over three years, we could do a lot."" Caught in the middle of these policy disputes are farmers such as Benford Bizeki. His last harvest, in April and May, produced 10 bags of corn, each containing 110 pounds, instead of the 50 or 60 bags he usually produces. Not only were the rains poorly timed, but he no longer had money for fertilizer. ""We would have had enough food if we had fertilizer,"" said Bizeki, a father of three who appears to be about 40. He was wearing a torn checkered shirt, grubby shorts and green sandals so old the soles were worn through. Like many people in Malawi, Bizeki has become so poor he can barely set aside money throughout the year to buy fertilizer and seeds when he needs them, he said. He and his family are sometimes so hungry they eat seeds. It wasn't always this way. In the late 1990s, a Chinese aid group built an irrigation system that drew water from the nearby Nkhuza River into a series of concrete-lined canals. For four years, Bizeki said, this gave his fields enough water for a second growing season. He grew so much corn and rice he was able to sell the excess crops. The profit allowed him to pay for school fees and clothing, he said. But over the years, the plastic pipes that carried the water to the fields broke and were not replaced. Now they are all gone, and the canals are mostly dry. Bizeki's neighbors use tin pans to carry the remaining water, a few cups at a time, to their thirsty crops."21-Nov-05,ETHIOPIA (98%); UNITED STATES (94%); AFRICA (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (78%),"Kassa Tadesse does not affiliate with political parties. He is no activist and never has been, he says. But in the past six months, that has changed. Tadesse drove yesterday from his home in Silver Spring to Northwest Washington, where more than a thousand members of the Ethiopian community  gathered to raise money for relatives of people killed or detained during election-related violence in their homeland this month. ""I am just an Ethiopian who is angry about what's going on in my country,"" he said at Washington Hebrew Congregation, where the $50-a-ticket fundraiser  --  a community meeting  --  was held. ""I am here to stand against the present situation. There are mass arrests, killings. People are scared. My relatives are there. Children are scared when they walk to school."" More than 40 people died and thousands were detained this month after demonstrators contested the May 15 election results that favored Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and his ruling party, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front. Medical officials have said police have killed many of the victims; Meles  contends that the opposition groups are responsible for inciting the violence. The groups say the election was rigged, and European Union officials have said the election did not meet international standards. But government officials say the irregularities were not significant enough to have swayed the election. Once before during this year, demonstrations in Ethiopia ended in violence. In June, police shot student protesters in Addis Ababa, the country's capital. Meles has promised an independent inquiry into all the killings. Daniel Abebe said he has no doubt that the election was rigged and that the government has become a dictatorship. ""The facts on the ground are very convincing,"" said Abebe, who drove from Richmond to attend the fundraiser. ""We're not even talking democracy now. It's just basic human rights,"" he said. Ethiopian officials said local protesters have exaggerated claims because of a lack of information. ""Everything is now calm. Everything the government is doing is in accordance with the laws and regulation of that country. That's it,"" said Mesfin Andrias, a spokesman for the Ethiopian Embassy. ""Those who have tried to incite violence, those specific extremists, they are under custody,"" he said. He urged patience while the independent investigation continues. The Washington region is home to one of the largest groups of Ethiopians outside Africa. The 2000 Census recorded at least 15,000 Ethiopian immigrants in the area, although community leaders say the number is much higher. Yesterday's event was their latest effort to call attention to the turmoil in their homeland. On Tuesday, thousands marched from Capitol Hill past the State Department, World Bank and International Monetary Fund buildings to the White House. They urged U.S. officials to pressure Meles to free political prisoners; create an independent judiciary, election board and security force; allow for freedom of the press; and end the violence. Many Ethiopians across the region are watching events in their country with great concern and hope that the local protests will get the U.S. government's attention. ""Over the last two weeks, they have woken from their slumber, and now they are making noise,"" Seyoum Solomon, an economist at the World Bank and member of the Coalition for Unity and Democracy, Ethiopia's leading opposition party, said recently at Addis Ababa, a Silver Spring restaurant. Many of his friends back home are imprisoned or are in hiding, he said, and he calls the U.S. government's support of the current leadership ""an embarrassment."" Seated nearby, Tigist, 25, a Montgomery College student who would not give her last name out of concern for her family in Addis Ababa, said that a friend's cousin was jailed recently. She is worried about her family and friends. ""They have to stop killing innocent people,"" she said."2-Dec-05,"TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (94%); AFRICA (94%); UKRAINE (75%); AUSTRIA (73%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (70%)","""Darwin's Nightmare"" fully lives up to its chilling title, a cinema verite journey to the heart of darkness  --  not, mind you, the heart of Africa, where it transpires, but to the murkiest reaches of human apathy and despair. The documentary, which was made by Austrian filmmaker Hubert Sauper, examines a phenomenon that took root 40 years ago in Lake Victoria, in Tanzania, where as a ""little scientific experiment,"" the Nile perch was introduced to the thriving aquatic ecosystem. In short order, the voracious fish ate everything in its path, including other fish and the lake's myriad plant species. Today, the Nile perch is Lake Victoria's only denizen and even now the species is cannibalizing itself. It turns out that, for Sauper, the Nile perch is an apt metaphor for the First World and its rapacious exploitation of Africa's natural resources. ""Darwin's Nightmare"" makes it clear that the disaster isn't just environmental but economic, with Lake Victoria's towns being forced to become monocultures, where processing plants prepare hundreds of tons of fish a day for export to Europe. As Sauper informs viewers in one of the film's several intertitles, 2 million white people eat Nile perch every day. In a stinging irony, precisely that number of Tanzanians are starving, able only to consume the fish heads and maggot-infested carcasses. With unblinking, often sickening deliberation, Sauper methodically connects the dots that begin as seemingly unrelated interviews with Russian and Ukrainian cargo pilots, teenage Tanzanian prostitutes, orphaned children living on the streets and the chief of a multinational corporation that bears a striking resemblance to ThreeBees from John le Carre's ""The Constant Gardener."" What gradually comes into focus is a terrifying, appalling, infuriating cycle of exploitation and corruption, with those pilots flying in weapons for Africa's myriad civil wars and flying out fish, leaving Tanzania impoverished and dying. (One observer notes that about 10 fishermen die a month, mostly from AIDS contracted from prostitutes, as well as the occasional crocodile attack.) Sauper takes his time building his case, never inserting his own editorial voice but letting the Tanzanians, and occasionally a representative of the World Bank or European Union or United Nations or some other interchangeable part of Ineffective and Cynical Bureaucracy Writ Large, tell their own story. That story is one of constant, unalloyed grief, as the film's subjects, many of them children, fall victim to poverty, HIV, violence, greed and, the granddaddy of them all, indifference. (Even the plastic used in packaging the fish is implicated in this grievous matrix, as the kids are shown melting it down to sniff its narcotizing fumes.) ""Darwin's Nightmare"" is many things, including an environmental cautionary tale, a critique of globalization and a portrait of a community, country and continent in deep crisis. But at its most profound level it's about the ways in which those of us on the receiving end of the supply chain routinely and unknowingly break faith with the most dispossessed and defenseless of the world. As one of the pilots says while recounting a past run in which he delivered tanks to Angola and brought back fruit from South Africa, that year African children got guns for Christmas, while European children got grapes. Darwin's Nightmare (107 minutes, at Landmark's E Street Cinema) is not rated and contains disturbing images and adult themes."16-Dec-05,CHAD (79%),"Chad was supposed to be the exception in the tragic history of striking oil in poor countries, where oil has fomented corruption, eroded government institutions, undermined the development of a middle class, cut jobs and led to wars. In 2003, Chad became the site of an experiment to test whether oil money could pay for medicines and schools rather than luxury cars and weapons. The World Bank set up a system in which only 15 percent of the revenues from three oil fields would go into the general government coffers. Most of the rest would be spent on fighting poverty or saved for the post-oil years. Chad's agreement on these rules attracted ExxonMobil and other investors. The early results are not encouraging. There is little evidence of improvements in living standards, and a lot of worrisome signs that money is disappearing. Now President Idriss Deby, claiming the government is broke, has decided to scuttle the restraints on his spending. He wants to double the percentage of oil money that goes to general government funds, scrap any saving for the future and allow the money earmarked for antipoverty programs to be spent on security. The World Bank, which has $300 million in programs in Chad, has criticized the proposal. ExxonMobil has been silent. Both need to be warning Chad of the costs of breaking the deal. If the Chad project fails, the bank should reconsider whether it should continue to make oil loans in countries where governments are corrupt and citizens have no real powers -- deals or no deals."17-Dec-05,CHAD (95%),"FIVE YEARS AGO, the World Bank lent money and credibility to a risky experiment. Despite the depressing record of oil projects in poor countries  --  they tend to fuel corruption rather than boost development  --  the bank provided $190 million to kick-start the oil industry in one of the world's most impoverished dictatorships, the landlocked African state of Chad. As a condition of its lending, the bank insisted that oil revenue be used for poverty reduction, and at first it mostly was. But now Chad's government wants to relax the restrictions on how it spends its petrodollars. Unless Chad backs down, it will become harder for the World Bank to justify future oil projects in poor countries. Western oil companies that invest in such places will face more criticism, too. The bank's Chad experiment was always a gamble. Its own research suggested that aid to countries with poor governance was often wasted.  Indeed the bank had poured nearly $1 billion into Chad since the country gained its independence in 1960, and it has seen little in return. The bet was that Chad's governance could be upgraded as part of the oil project: The bank required Chad's dictator to set up an independent agency to monitor the spending of the oil revenue, and the agency was assisted by Western advisers and overseen by a board that included Chadian opposition groups. Having failed during the 1980s to improve developing countries' policies by attaching conditions to its loans, the World Bank hoped that the creation of a new oversight institution staffed with forceful officials might succeed. This hope has been at least partially vindicated. The flow of petrodollars to Chad's government has remained transparent, which is more than can be said in many African oil states. The new monitoring agency has reported on how the petrodollars are being spent, criticizing mismanaged projects with an openness that's good for Chad's political culture as well as its efforts against poverty. But the new attitude from Chad's government threatens this progress. It is demanding the right to spend oil revenue not just on anti-poverty projects but on almost anything, including its security forces. The World Bank's new boss, Paul D. Wolfowitz, is belatedly pressuring Chad's government to reconsider this option. But Mr. Wolfowitz needs high-level help from other outsiders, notably the American and French governments and Exxon Mobil Corp., which leads the consortium that developed local oil. So far Exxon Mobil has kept its head down, hoping to leave the fight over revenue management to the bank and government donors. But in a world of high oil prices, petrodollars are a more important lever on Chad's rulers than aid flows, so Exxon Mobil needs to use its influence. The company ought to be glad to do this, because it has a stake in showing that oil can boost development. Otherwise it will be targeted by critics in rich countries and may face sabotage and violence in the poor countries where it operates."23-Dec-05,UNITED STATES (92%); GUATEMALA (91%); GHANA (86%),"To the Editor: Your Dec. 16 editorial ''Breaking the Oil Curse'' rightly highlights the failure of the Chad oil experiment. But rather than heeding the lessons from its investment in the project, the World Bank continues to invest in extractive industries projects that run a great risk of failing to help the poor. Recently approved or planned projects in Guatemala, Congo, Ghana, Russia and elsewhere have a significant chance of increasing conflict, corruption and environmental degradation. The World Bank should heed the call of an independent assessment of the sector it commissioned and work with stakeholders to establish minimum governance and human rights thresholds that must be present before approving such projects. Ian Gary Washington, Dec. 16, 2005 The writer is policy adviser for extractive industries, Oxfam America."27-Dec-05,CHAD (95%); CENTRAL AFRICA (92%); SUDAN (79%); AFRICA (79%),"Six months after assuming the presidency of the World Bank, Paul D. Wolfowitz is facing his first big test in his new job. An avowed hard-liner on corruption, he must decide whether the bank should wash its hands of one of its most controversial projects, in a country with a notoriously corrupt regime. At issue is a 650-mile pipeline that the World Bank helped finance for Chad, a landlocked central African nation of about 10 million, to transport oil from the country's interior to a coastal port. Despite objections by critics that oil money in such countries is almost invariably squandered or stolen, the bank backed the pipeline in the hope of showing that Africa could use its mineral riches to benefit the poor. It secured an agreement with Chadian leaders that most of the government's oil proceeds would go into a closely supervised escrow fund in London, to be disbursed and invested on the nation's behalf in areas such as education, health and rural development. Now that the oil has been flowing for two years, the wisdom of the bank's gamble is coming under renewed questioning because the government is threatening to unilaterally change the terms of the deal. Out of cash for its regular budget amid mounting security problems involving army deserters and refugees on the border with Sudan, the government announced in October that it intends to amend the law governing the petrodollars so it can use a larger chunk of the money for any purpose it likes, including its security forces. Under the proposed new law, the government would double, to 30 percent, the amount of oil money that it can spend without oversight. The government would also halt the diversion of 10 percent of the oil money into a ""future generations"" fund that is to be spent only after Chad's oil wells run dry. A low point for the bank came several weeks ago after repeated phone calls from Wolfowitz to Chad's president, Idriss Deby, went unreturned, according to bank officials, who said the episode aroused considerable consternation in their ranks. Deby has taken a defiant public stance in response to the bank's protests against the proposed legal changes, declaring last month, ""I will not allow anyone, even if they are a partner, to violate our national sovereignty."" Deepening the bank's woes, its resident representative in Chad, Noel Tshiani, was placed on leave after  allegations of sexual  harassment, according to Chadian press reports that bank officials confirmed only on condition of anonymity because the matter is under investigation. Tshiani declined to respond to e-mails seeking comment. In the past few days, however, the situation has improved slightly  as the government postponed parliamentary action on the legal changes and sent a letter dated Dec. 16 asking the bank to dispatch a high-level mission ""as soon as possible"" to N'Djamena, the capital  --  possibly an olive branch, though bank officials are not sure. All this poses a tough dilemma for Wolfowitz, the former U.S. deputy defense secretary who took the bank's helm last June pledging to put a high priority on intensifying the bank's anti-corruption efforts. The bank has the legal right to take punitive measures in response to any action by the Chadian government to change the agreement, which so far has generated more than $300 million in revenue for public purposes in Chad. The measures could include barring new aid to the country and insisting on immediate repayment of the loans it made for the pipeline. But the bank is instinctively loath to cut off financial ties with a country; it argues that the country's poor are likely to suffer most from the withholding of aid  --  a painful prospect in Chad, one of the world's most impoverished nations, where 80 percent of the population relies on subsistence farming and livestock raising. In Chad's case, a cutoff of bank money raises serious geopolitical concerns as well, because it might increase the risk of a financial collapse for the government that could lead to Chad joining other neighboring countries as a failed state and a haven for terrorists. The cash-strapped government has already fallen into arrears on salary payments to civil servants. Doing the same to the military raises the danger of a bloody coup against Deby, who has ruled Chad since seizing power in 1990. On the other hand, if Wolfowitz is too flexible with Chad, he risks exposing the World Bank and himself to criticism that the fight against corruption is little more than hot air. Chad tied with Bangladesh for the worst corruption rating among nations in the most recent annual survey by Transparency International. The government's cash squeeze suggests that misappropriation of public resources is continuing apace. Normal budget accounting is nonexistent, and bank officials cannot understand how the government can be broke, especially since it has directly received some of the oil money, about $38 million, for its general budget. Allowing the government to take money from the London escrow fund might only invite further waste and would set a terrible precedent for future projects in the oil and mining sector, bank officials fear, by signaling that such ""ring-fencing"" arrangements don't work. So far, Wolfowitz has limited himself to a statement expressing ""serious concern"" about the proposed changes in the law, which ""threaten to undermine the objectives of socio-economic development, poverty reduction, accountability and transparency,"" according to the statement. Bank officials declined to go beyond the statement, or speak on the record at all, citing the delicacy of negotiations with the Chadians. The bank's statement, issued Dec. 8, is viewed as too timid by many antipoverty activists, both inside and outside of Chad. The bank's difficulties, they contend, shows that their doubts about the project were well founded. ""I've tried not to say 'I told you so,' "" said Ian Gary, a policy adviser  for Oxfam America who is a longtime critic of the pipeline. ""We had always feared that the leverage of the World Bank and other donors would decrease substantially once these oil revenues started to flow, and that's what's happening."" ""But there's no good solution right now,"" Gary said, adding that although he thinks the bank should respond very sternly if Chad violates the terms of its agreement, ""I wouldn't want to be in their position."" Chad's finance minister, Abbas Mahamat Tolli, contended in a phone interview that the government has good reason for insisting on changing the agreement. Although world oil prices have roughly doubled since the pipeline deal was signed, the revenue going to the government has been ""disappointing,"" he said, and the government questions the international oil companies' explanation that much of the petroleum being pumped is laden with impurities. ""Relative to our needs for poverty reduction, and the lack of security, the amount of money we are getting is rather small,"" he said. ""We understand that in principle it's good to save for the future. But the people of Chad don't understand why they should be told they must save for future generations when they have needs right now."" Spending money to improve security in the often-lawless countryside, he added, is perfectly consistent with poverty reduction, because ""we can't conceive of economic development in an environment which is not secure."" Bank officials say they are willing to sit down with the Chadians and examine the reasons for the government's cash woes and its increased needs. The bank might accept amendments to the agreement, a staffer said, ""but they have to be arrived at logically, in a structured review process, not just coming out of thin air."" The letter of invitation for the bank to send a mission, which is also addressed to the International Monetary Fund, could provide an opening for a mutually satisfactory compromise. But bank officials are crossing their fingers, because the letter also suggests that the Chadians will stick to their guns. ""[T]he Government of Chad is surprised by the position your two institutions have taken, in which you claim you were not informed by our intention to make changes to the Petroleum Revenue Management Law,"" states the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post. ""We're trying to work through this thing,"" another bank official said. ""We're hoping for further dialogue."""7-Jan-06,CHAD (94%); AFRICA (92%); SUDAN (79%),"World Bank President Paul D. Wolfowitz announced yesterday that he is suspending all of the bank's aid to Chad, taking a hard line in the first major test of his pledge to fight corruption. The move followed a serious setback in a controversial oil pipeline project for Chad that the bank had trumpeted to show how it could help African nations use their natural resource wealth honestly and effectively. In numerous previous instances, such wealth has been squandered or stolen. The bank agreed in 1999 to help finance the 650-mile pipeline, which enables landlocked Chad to export its oil, on the condition that most of the revenue go into a special fund in London to be used for projects such as schools and health clinics benefiting Chad's poor. But the Chadian government recently insisted on taking more of the money for its own purposes, including strengthening its security forces, despite the bank's objections. Wolfowitz said he acted after speaking by phone with Chad's president, Idriss Deby, for 45 minutes Tuesday and two hours Thursday. ""There did not seem to be any movement in their decision to amend the law that was the basis of the 1999 agreement, and until we can come to a better understanding, we have to suspend disbursements on World Bank loans to Chad,"" Wolfowitz said. Wolfowitz emphasized that ""this is not the end of dialogue or the end of negotiations,"" and that ""our actions can be reversed anytime we reach an agreement with Chad."" He voiced sympathy for Deby's complaints that the country has serious security problems from the inflow of refugees from neighboring Sudan, which is riven by civil strife. But especially since the government has yet to satisfactorily explain how it has spent the money thus far, Wolfowitz said, he was obliged to counter Chad's ""breach"" of the pipeline deal. The situation in Chad has presented Wolfowitz with an acute dilemma six months after taking the bank's helm and pledging to put a high priority on the bank's anti-corruption initiatives. Chad tied with Bangladesh for the worst corruption rating among nations in a 2005 survey by Transparency International, an organization that monitors corruption worldwide. Allowing the Deby government more access to unmonitored oil revenue, bank officials fear, would simply lead to more waste. But the bank usually refrains from cutting off loans to countries except in extreme circumstances because the poor in those countries would presumably bear the brunt of the pain. Moreover, Chad presents serious geopolitical concerns; a collapse of the government could cause the country to join some of its neighbors as a failed state and haven for terrorists, a matter about which Wolfowitz, a former deputy secretary of defense, is keenly aware. Under the actions announced yesterday, the bank will freeze about $124 million that was due to be disbursed on projects in Chad over several years, and it will also halt new loans and grants. The bank also had the right to demand accelerated repayment of $41 million that Chad still owes on the pipeline loan, but Wolfowitz did not invoke that penalty. The bank is one of Chad's major sources of support, but the government has received about $300 million annually in recent years in various forms of aid from donors including the U.S. and French governments, the European Union, the African Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Wolfowitz declined to speculate on how other donors may react. ""We're not offering them any recommendations one way or another,"" he said, although he is asking them to prod the Chadian government to take the situation seriously and engage in negotiations. Given the situation on the Sudanese border, he added, ""it may in fact be an argument for, in the right circumstances, some donors considering additional assistance."" Wolfowitz's decision was praised by Ian Gary, a policy adviser for Oxfam America who is a longtime critic of the pipeline. ""The World Bank did what it needed to do,"" he said. He asserted, however, that the debacle shows that the bank should refrain from funding similar projects in the future. ""This has been rightly seen as a major test case of whether World Bank involvement in a project like this could achieve the poverty reduction that we all want to see,"" Gary said. In Chad's capital of N'Djamena, Oil Minister Nasser Mohammed Hassan said the government plans to  issue a statement today , the Associated Press reported."7-Jan-06,CHAD (97%); CENTRAL AFRICA (92%); UNITED STATES (92%); CAMEROON (79%); AFRICA (79%),"Paul D. Wolfowitz, the World Bank president, on Friday suspended all loans to the central African nation of Chad, including one that helped finance a $4.2 billion oil pipeline, on the ground that it had broken an agreement to largely dedicate its oil revenues to alleviating the country's extreme poverty. Chad's Parliament voted last week to allow the country's substantial oil income to be spent on the military as well as on schools, hospitals and roads. It also voted to double the percentage of money that can be spent with no oversight from a committee of government and civilian representatives. In a conference call with reporters, Mr. Wolfowitz said he spent two hours on the phone on Thursday night with Chad's president, Idriss Deby. Mr. Wolfowitz said he saw no alternative to suspending the bank's $124 million in loans to Chad, even as he held open the door to further negotiations. ''I think it's very much in the interests of the Chadian government to establish in the eyes of everybody that they are honorable parties to the agreements that they undertake,'' he said. Chad's ambassador to the United States, Mahamoud Adam Bechir, reached on his cellphone, said he would comment on the bank's decision only in a face-to-face interview, but added that he could not do so until Monday. Mr. Wolfowitz said President Deby had told him that Chad had a sovereign right to decide how to spend the oil money -- a position that Mr. Wolfowitz accepted while insisting that it violated Chad's agreement with the bank and that it entitled the bank to suspend its loans. Chad's actions are a serious blow to the bank's attempt to break the so-called natural resources curse, which has so often doomed African countries endowed with oil, diamonds and gold to deepening corruption and violent conflict. Transparency International, an independent anticorruption organization, last year ranked Chad and Bangladesh as the world's most corrupt countries. When the World Bank extended a $39.5 million pipeline loan to Chad as a portion of the larger financing package, the bank's managers reasoned that the country's most realistic hope of fighting poverty was to harness the billions of dollars its oil fields could produce for development. Chad, with 10 million people, is largely a desert where 8 in 10 people live on less than $1 a day. In exchange for the loan, Chad agreed that all payments from the consortium that built the pipeline, which runs from Chad through Cameroon, would go into an escrow account at Citibank in London, and that taxes on the oil profits would go directly into the national treasury. Chad promised to spend 72 percent of the money from the escrow account to reduce poverty. A spokeswoman for ExxonMobil, which led the consortium, declined on Friday to comment on the bank's decision. Before the World Bank approved the pipeline loan, some antipoverty groups recommended that it wait until the country had tackled corruption and improved its ability to manage such a large project. And some in Chad worried that the government would abandon its promise to spend the revenues on the poor once the pipeline was finished. In 2004, Emil Salim, an independent consultant commissioned by the bank to advise it on its energy investments, strongly recommended that the bank stop supporting oil projects by 2008, advice that the bank's governing board rejected. Ian Gary, a policy adviser at the relief organization Oxfam America, said, ''The Chad case is emblematic of the problems in the World Bank's support to oil and mining in countries where there are severe governance and human rights problems.'' In his comments on Friday, Mr. Wolfowitz did not address the broader issues. He was clearly still hoping to salvage the bank's agreement with Chad. He expressed sympathy for Chad's position that it needed to spend more money on security because of turmoil in the neighboring Darfur region of Sudan, which has spilled over into Chad. Still holding out the possibility of a compromise, he said some donors might consider additional assistance to help Chad cope with its security problems. But for now, he said, the loan suspension stands. ''It's my decision as the president,'' he said, ''but we briefed our board this morning, and I would say that it was a consensus, absolutely solid consensus around the room, that this was the appropriate and necessary action.''"2-Feb-06,KENYA (94%); AFRICA (90%),"  Kenya's finance minister, David Mwiraria, left, announced his resignation after allegations of corruption. President Mwai Kibaki's former anti-corruption ombudsman, John Githongo, and the independent newspaper The Daily Nation have said that Mr. Mwiraria was among senior officials, including Vice President Moody Awori and Energy Minister Kiraitu Murungi, who were behind several schemes involving nonexistent companies receiving government payments for security contracts. Earlier yesterday, an Anti-Corruption Commission official said that Mr. Awori had been questioned in one multimillion-dollar fraud. On Tuesday, the World Bank said it was withholding $260 million in loans to Kenya because of corruption concerns."24-Feb-06,CONGO (92%),"THE WORLD Bank's board faces a decision on debt relief today that has broad ramifications for development. The Congo Republic, a small oil state, hopes to win approval of a reduction in its debt , and by some measures it may deserve that. Under the rules governing debt relief, a country whose debt is worth 21/2 times its government revenue qualifies for forgiveness, and a team from the International Monetary Fund has determined that Congo meets this standard. But Congo's corrupt government keeps part of its oil revenue from showing up on its books, raising questions as to whether it deserves forgiveness. The World Bank's president, Paul D. Wolfowitz, rightly argues that debt relief should be delayed. The governments that sit on the bank's board, including African representatives and the Europeans who often support them, should accept Mr. Wolfowitz's position. Congo's efforts to hide oil revenue have been amply documented. The British watchdog group Global Witness has described a network of shell companies established to keep money away from creditors. KPMG, the auditor of Congo's state oil company, has refused to sign off on its accounts three years running. In a memo explaining the finding that Congo met the test for debt relief, the International Monetary Fund concedes that ""oil revenues continue to be diverted for other uses and do not reach the treasury."" Congo's supporters on the World Bank's board argue that the country has met the objective test for debt relief and should not be kept waiting. It's hard to take this seriously. Mr. Wolfowitz's proposed remedy is moderate. He suggests that Congo should adopt measures to reduce oil corruption, a position with which even Congo's defenders concur. But rather than having this trigger an immediate and irrevocable $2 billion worth of debt relief, Mr. Wolfowitz wants Congo to implement the anti-corruption measures for three years before getting full debt reduction. In the meantime, relief would flow into a carefully monitored poverty-reduction fund. This would allow Congo to reap some development benefits while maintaining incentives to fight corruption, at least for three years. Given that Congo is benefiting in the meantime from high oil prices, this hardly seems draconian. The larger issue behind this fight is the seriousness with which donors are willing to take on corruption. Big strides have been made over the past decade in acknowledging that corruption is a problem, but, too often, corrupt countries have been indulged by donors. If Congo's allies on the World Bank's board get their way today, the see-no-evil faction will have won. Better to proceed slowly on Congo  --  and send a needed wake-up call to other corrupt countries."13-Mar-06,"AFRICA (94%); UNITED STATES (92%); IRAQ (92%); UNITED KINGDOM (91%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (79%); CONGO (79%)","Last year was celebrated as the ""Year of Africa."" Tony Blair proposed a doubling of aid to the continent; the world's rich nations promised debt elimination; and the Bush administration talked up its remarkably good record in boosting foreign assistance. But 2006 is shaping up as the year of ""What to do with Africa?"" as donors grapple with the challenge of making aid work. And unless the development institutions demonstrate that they can spend the money effectively, 2007 may be the year in which Africa is once again abandoned. Just look at the Republic of the Congo, a small oil state that lies to the west of the other, bigger Congo, which used to be Zaire. The Congo we're talking about has mountains of debt and canyons of poverty, so it's a candidate for the debt cancellation that was trumpeted last year. But it's also rotten with corruption, rendering most aid efforts pointless. When the matter of Congo's debt relief came before the boards of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund recently, there was a chance to confront this dilemma. Instead, the institutions tried to have it both ways. Last week they acknowledged Congo's corruption but cut the country's debt payments anyway. If the bank and the IMF aren't careful, Congo could emerge as their version of the oil-for-food scandal that discredited the United Nations last year. Congo's oil rogues are in cahoots with some of the same operators who cropped up in the Volcker report on Iraq's oil rip-offs. Both cases make the French establishment look odious. Both involve multilateral institutions whose staffs might want to blow the whistle on corruption but who are discouraged from doing so by political masters in Western capitals. The workings of the Congolese kleptocracy have emerged thanks to three forces: Earlier efforts by the IMF and World Bank to demand transparency; court cases brought by frustrated creditors; and the investigative efforts of Global Witness, a British development group. The star of the story is Denis Gokana, the head of the state oil company, who has arranged for more than $400 million worth of Congo's oil to be sold to shell companies owned by none other than himself, according to British court records. Just as in the Iraq oil scam, these sales were discounted, enabling the shell companies to sell the oil  at a nice profit to firms such as Glencore  --  which, according to the Volcker report, was a leading provider of kickbacks to Saddam Hussein  under the oil-for-food program. Sales at suspiciously low prices were just one method for draining profits from Congo's national oil company and, therefore, from the Congolese people. Gokana's shell companies also lent money to the state oil firm at interest rates higher than 80 percent per year, according to Global Witness. Meanwhile, one of the Gokana firms acquired a tenth of a promising Congolese oil bloc known as Marine XI, at a price that has never been published. The lead investor in Marine XI is a company controlled by an oilman named Patrick Maugein, who also  appears in the Volcker report. Maugein's company is reported to have bid considerably less for the concession than a Canadian rival but won it anyway with what the company describes as the ""best"" offer. Last year Gokana appeared in a British court to answer some of these charges. The judge ruled that his testimony was riddled with lies. The creditor that brought that court case, Kensington International, has also brought a racketeering case in New York, alleging that BNP Paribas, a major French bank, has colluded with Congolese officials to hide oil revenue. BNP was the leading financier of Iraq's oil-for-food deals, and it was accused  in the Volcker report of turning a blind eye to the use of front companies to hide the real identities of  Hussein's oil partners. BNP disputes Kensington's allegations and has described the case as an ""abuse."" Whatever the French bank's role, Congo's corruption appears not to offend the French government, which has led the charge to grant Congo debt relief even though the evidence of its unworthiness has been reported in the French press. In a detailed article in December, the French daily La Tribune explained how millions had been siphoned out of the national oil company and how yet more millions failed to make it from the national oil company to the national treasury. But, as La Tribune noted, President Jacques Chirac and Congo's ruling strongman are old friends. This is a scandal, and it's hard to see why the rich world's taxpayers should tolerate even a hint of debt relief for Congo. Last year the country earned more than $2 billion from oil, or $600 per person; if it spent that money competently, it would not have two-thirds of its people living below the $1-a-day line. But rather than send that message, the World Bank and the IMF have cut Congo's debt payments and held out the hope of outright debt cancellation, provided that the country meets various anti-corruption conditions. In the past, Congo has mocked such conditions. It would probably mock them in the future the day after full debt cancellation went through. Why does this seem likely? Because you don't have to guess what Congo's president thinks of the fight for transparent government. In an interview in February, he dismissed the critics of corruption as ""people who search for lice in the heads of this country's authorities."" smallaby@washpost.com"18-Mar-06,KENYA (97%); UNITED KINGDOM (92%); ENGLAND (90%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%); AFRICA (79%),"THE question that seems to spring to mind in conversation with John Githongo, Kenya's exiled anticorruption czar, is this: Is he some kind of African Lenin -- as some have suggested, and not just because of his goatee -- awaiting the call home to a land on the verge of change? Or is he, as his critics depict him, a man who has betrayed his roots, his class, his ethnicity and his nation by displaying its dirty laundry at a safe range of 4,000 miles? Bluntly put, after exposing Kenyan graft to the highest level with a dossier that has shaken up a government beset by public discontent, is he now in line for the highest office? Does this 40-year-old former journalist want to be president? He is used to the question -- and somewhat coy with the answer. ''Everybody asks me this,'' he said in an interview in a borrowed office at St. Antony's College. He took refuge here last year after fleeing Kenya in part because of concerns about his personal safety as a campaigner against the staggering level of corruption that has long been associated with his East African homeland. ''My actions here have put me in a political realm,'' he said, seeming to choose his words carefully. But, unlike the upper-crust of Kenyan society in which he was raised, ''I have no rural constituency. I have betrayed my entire tribe and the elite around the president -- which still has them spluttering with rage. But then I don't really give a hoot about that. So my attitude is that I'm going to continue here for a while, forcing a change.'' Mr. Githongo has already forced change. Three Kenyan ministers have quit, and the police have seized the passports of officials linked to graft allegations chronicled in a 36-page dossier he compiled after his self-exile. ''It's not over,'' he said. ''It's just starting. Right now about 30 percent has come out.'' But the campaign against corruption has a wider context, he suggested, set in Africa's rapid urbanization, which is destroying its rural traditions, making the continent's teeming, tawdry, tumbledown cities the magnet for a new generation. Mr. Githongo is tall, with the mountainous shoulders of someone who pumps iron as a hobby. That is not the only muscle shielding him; the British police have extended discreet protection for fear his enemies might move against him in the manner of other assaults in the past on high-profile Kenyans. Clad in a gunmetal-gray shirt and black jeans, contemplating the world through steel-rimmed glasses, he said he had been advised to change apartments and vary his routes to work. Yet his manner seems far more casual than such perils suggest. A FORMER investigative journalist and a former head of the Kenya chapter of the anticorruption organization Transparency International, Mr. Githongo was appointed President Mwai Kibaki's chief graft investigator after the new government took power in December 2002. But, he said, he quickly realized that his presence was intended more as an artful ploy to protect the corrupt than as a device to root them out. His father, an accountant who once worked in the office of Jomo Kenyatta, independent Kenya's founding president, is associated with the elite. The family is from the same Kikuyu ethnic background as Mr. Kibaki. Government ministers believed that they could press him into cooperating with them in return for wiping out debt owed by his father, Mr. Githongo said. ''They had been counting on me to do nothing,'' he said. ''People would tell me: 'This is the way things are. It's just the way things are done. We just have to do it with greater finesse, more carefully, than the others.' '' The presence of an anticorruption czar, moreover, was seen by the government as a political necessity. ''Anticorruption wins you votes,'' he said. ''It doesn't mean you necessarily believe it. And it also helps with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank'' and other international donors whose generosity Africa craves. (Sir Edward Clay, Britain's former high commissioner -- or ambassador -- in Kenya recently accused the World Bank of ''feeding the pig of corruption'' by extending $120 million in loans to Kenya just as Mr. Githongo's allegations were surfacing.) ''What's special about Africa's corruption is the starkness of the inequality,'' Mr. Githongo said. ''That is unique -- just how extreme the divide between those who have and those who don't have is.'' And, he said, since ''the method of political mobilization is very often ethnic, tribal, it makes these inequalities combustible.'' In tilting against graft, Mr. Githongo seems to be positioning himself across a far broader front, part of a generational shift among Africans burdened by what he calls the ancestral ties between urban homes and rural roots that bind and, in his view, stymie much of the continent. The bond between town and country has long required those who do well in Africa's cities, in government or business, to spread largess among their clans, families and extended families back home. That encourages graft to feed the expectations of distant kin. But society is changing, Mr. Githongo said. The notion of the village as ''home'' is giving way to the pressures of the slum-fringed cities. ''The age of digging the ground is dying,'' he said. ''That sort of ancestral connection with the land, which is the cause of so many of our problems, is illogical in the modern age.'' With his country's rapid urbanization, ''what were towns are now cities,'' he added. ''The best brains are being sucked into these sprawling, disorganized but very vibrant urban centers. My point of reference is the city.'' He has been struck by the example of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who wrenched modern Turkey from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire in the 1920's. The inference seemed to be that he believed that his own continent would benefit from a similar wrench in an era of shifting points of identity. ''Most Africans are several things at the same time,'' Mr. Githongo continued. His own grandfather, for instance, was baptized as a Roman Catholic by Irish missionaries. Mr. Githongo was born in England before moving to Kenya as an infant. MR. GITHONGO was educated at a prestigious Roman Catholic school in Kenya -- he describes himself still as a practicing Roman Catholic -- but returned to Britain to study philosophy and economics at Swansea University in Wales. He is used to high circles. Since moving to Oxford he has traveled to the United States meeting with, among others, Paul D. Wolfowitz, the head of the World Bank . ''There's a part of you that is rural; there's part of you that's a lawyer or journalist; there's part of you that's ideological in a political way,'' he said. ''Religion has also done well across Africa. And there's no contradiction in all this: you can be a fervent Christian and also a lawyer who has to go back to the village and dispense patronage.'' That has to change, he says. ''Africa has been left behind by Asia and the others. We need to get our act together.''

But it was also a country united by one desire. ""The only thing we all don't want is war,"" Johnson-Sirleaf told a group of Washington Post editors and reporters on Thursday. ""This is a negative rallying cry. Until we find another, that is enough to proceed. We have seen it all and we don't want it."" But Liberia's peace is still fragile after 14  years of violent turmoil. So she must now use all her skills as a Harvard-trained economist and a veteran of Liberia's tumultuous politics to keep the country together and moving forward.

The elitish professor from outside, there is that too,"" said the former World Bank official, often called Liberia's ""iron lady."" On taking office, she acknowledged Thursday, she resisted the temptation to fire everyone in the government, notorious for corruption, and start with a clean slate. Instead, she is hoping that financial help from abroad will jump-start Liberia's economy and that a new truth and reconciliation commission will flush out lingering torment and rage from past injustices. The commission, she said, will ""investigate the roots and causes of conflict and lead to a process of forgiveness. Aggrieved parties can go and tell their stories and face their accusers. It is a cleansing process."" Johnson-Sirleaf said she had asked the United States ""to use its influence to help us out, not on the basis of more dependency, patronage or long-term support. We want sanctions against our resources lifted and to keep peacekeepers there for a while. We need U.S. support in debt relief to open up the multilateral tap of assistance."" Yesterday, after lunch at the White House, she was serenaded by opera singer Denyce Graves, a U.S.  cultural ambassador. Johnson-Sirleaf acknowledged that the tasks ahead are daunting. Corruption is rampant, electricity is scarce and roads are destroyed. Thousands of former child soldiers must be sent back to school or into vocational training. Will being a woman help? she was asked. ""Let me give you my standard response. I remind people that I am a professional and a technocrat who happens to be a woman,"" Johnson-Sirleaf said. ""But because of my sensitivities as a woman and a mother, I am likely to be more responsive to their needs. Doors are already opening for women in Africa. ""I have been working for this for a long time,"" she added. ""Now I have to make use of it."" Ashraf Qazi, Pakistan's former ambassador to Washington and the U.N. special representative in Baghdad since August 2004, has grown into his role as a conduit to Iraq's precarious leadership and power centers. This week, he returned here to brief Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and other officials on his impressions. A Muslim with a basic knowledge of Arabic, Qazi has had access to key spiritual and political players in Iraq. He has met in Najaf with the senior Shiite religious figure, Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, a reclusive figure who has declined to meet with any American representatives. Qazi said Sistani, whose ideas differ from the hard-line members of Iran's Shiite theocracy, has used his moral influence to steer the country on a more moderate course, and seeks to help stem interreligious violence that has climaxed in recent weeks. ""He is not a political leader. He has told me that unless political consensus and effective leadership emerges, his voice will not carry weight in the face of more outrages,"" Qazi said in an interview Monday. When a Shiite shrine in Samarra was blown up last month, Qazi said Sistani appealed to Shiite followers ""not to hold entire communities responsible and urged them to spare the lives of innocents. . . . He is the most respected voice in Iraq for the Shia and among other communities, but he has indicated that this may not hold in the face of more outrageous acts."" The U.N. envoy said he had also met with Moqtada al-Sadr, a younger and more radical Shiite leader who commands the loyalty of thousands of young Iraqis. He described Sadr as an ""authentic Arab"" who wields tremendous influence and sees himself as providing a bridge between Iraqis and other Arabs. Qazi said he planned to convey to Rice Sistani's fears that Iraqis may no longer heed his counsel for moderation. ""The current situation is a matter of concern and has to be addressed,"" he said.

State television broadcast images of bloody bodies of rebels, some still wrenching, piled on the steps of the National Assembly in N'Djamena, the capital. Witnesses reported seeing bodies in other areas of the city, news services said, and residents could be seen fleeing as helicopters hovered above. After several hours of fighting, President Idriss Deby declared victory in an address broadcast on radio and television. ""The situation in N'Djamena is under the control of the defense and security forces,"" he said. But diplomats and regional analysts expressed little hope that the crisis would fade quickly in this oil-rich but destitute country of about 10 million in north-central Africa. Chad has had a long and complex history of civil war and unrest since it gained independence from France in 1960. Deby seized power in a coup in 1990 and since then has been criticized for human rights abuses in the country and reneging on promises to the World Bank to use oil profits for development. He now says he will use the oil revenue to beef up his military to defend the government. Deby was once backed by Sudan, but a crisis in the Darfur region led to a bitter feud. Deby now accuses Sudan of supporting the rebel group, known as the United Front for Change, and allowing it to set up camps in Darfur. Sudan denies this. The rebel group is made up of army deserters who say they are frustrated by the lack of progress in Chad. Some of the higher-ranking defectors, many of whom are Deby's relatives, are also angry about the corruption surrounding the oil revenue, human rights groups say. The rebel leader, Mahamat Nour, told reporters that he believed he has enough support to take over the government by the weekend. At the same time, Darfur rebels, who have been battling government-backed Arab militiamen known as the Janjaweed, have set up bases in eastern Chad and at times have received housing and food from Chadian officials. Additionally, more than 200,000 Sudanese refugees have fled into Chad because of the upheaval in Darfur, which has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions. ""Chad's internal crisis is closely linked to the Darfur conflict,"" said Peter Takirambudde, Africa director at Human Rights Watch. ""The international community must warn Khartoum that it will be held responsible for any abuses against civilians committed by its proxies."" Already, there has been an increase in attacks on camps housing Darfur refugees. After the fighting this week between Chadian rebels and government forces, gunmen entered and briefly took control of the Goz Amer refugee camp in eastern Chad on Monday afternoon, forcing the United Nations to reduce staffing levels in some field offices. The region is very fragile, and the situation is ""alarming,"" said Antonio Guterres, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees. ""I urgently appeal to all sides in this political upheaval to respect the civilian character of the refugee camps and to leave in peace those who have already fled the terrors of Darfur,"" Guterres said in a statement. France, which supports Deby and has significant financial interests in the country, sent 150 troops to Chad this week to augment its contingent of about 1,200 soldiers to protect about 1,500 French citizens, the French Defense Ministry said in a statement. French fighter jets swooped over the country Wednesday and Thursday and fired warning shots at the rebels, according to news reports. It was unclear whether any civilians were injured."18-Apr-06,"SUDAN (96%); AFGHANISTAN (94%); CHAD (94%); IRAN, ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF (93%); SRI LANKA (92%); UNITED STATES (92%); ASIA (79%); PAKISTAN (79%); MIDDLE EAST (79%); FRANCE (79%); THAILAND (79%); INDIA (79%); IRAN (78%)","N'DJAMENA, Chad  --  Chad's president on Monday backed off a threat to expel Sudanese refugees, heeding international calls to protect the tens of thousands who have fled Sudan's volatile Darfur region. The government of President Idriss Deby also delayed a threat to halt oil production, saying it welcomed U.S. help in resolving a dispute with the World Bank over Chad's reneging on a pledge to spend oil revenue on projects to alleviate poverty. Deby, who is seeking a third term in May 3 elections, has been trying to draw attention to Chad's problems as he seeks help in stopping rebels he says are backed by neighboring Sudan. Chadian forces repelled a rebel assault on the capital Thursday. But the opposition United Front for Change was regrouping in the countryside, fueling fears of another bid to overthrow the government. *  TEHRAN  --  Iran said it would not be bullied or threatened by the United States into stopping its uranium enrichment work but would cooperate with the U.N. nuclear agency as an April 30 deadline loomed for an agency report. Also, the official Iran Daily newspaper reported that about 60 ambassadors would be replaced this year, including those in London, Paris and Berlin. It quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Mehdi Mostafavi as saying the replacements were a ""normal procedure,"" countering speculation that the move was a purge of the Foreign Ministry by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. *  KABUL, Afghanistan  --  President Hamid Karzai urged U.S.-led coalition forces to show restraint when attacking militants in residential areas after more than a dozen civilians and police officers were killed in two possible friendly fire incidents. As commanders began investigating the 13 deaths, U.S. and Afghan troops kept up pressure on insurgents in volatile Konar province, which borders Pakistan. Pakistani soldiers also deployed on their side of the frontier to stop Taliban fighters fleeing across the mountains. *  BANGKOK  --  Many candidates running for Thailand's purportedly nonpartisan Senate in Wednesday's election are the wives and allies of ruling party politicians, opponents of outgoing Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra say. They say this will help Thaksin continue controlling the government from behind the scenes by allowing his party to maintain its hold on the 200-seat upper house. He announced his resignation this month in the face of growing protests over allegations of corruption. *  COLOMBO, Sri Lanka  --  Land mine blasts in northern Sri Lanka killed four soldiers and two Tamil Tiger rebels, raising the death toll from a week of unrest to at least 50, police said. The violence is some of the worse since a 2002 cease-fire that continues to be challenged by clashes between ethnic Tamils and the majority Sinhalese. *  NEW DELHI  --  India said it would make no explicit commitment to the United States not to conduct nuclear tests as part of a landmark civilian atomic cooperation deal. *  SRINAGAR, India  --  A senior politician in Indian Kashmir was wounded and two of his guards were killed in an attack by suspected separatist militants, police said. *  TOKYO  --  A former Japanese soldier last seen by his family when he went off to World War II has resurfaced in Ukraine and is returning home to see his relatives after 60 years, the government said. Ishinosuke Uwano, now 83, had been declared among Japan's war dead in 2000. *  RIO DE JANEIRO  --  A gang of about a dozen masked and armed people raided a building lobby in the City Hall complex on Easter, took 15 guards and about 20 maintenance workers hostage for about 40 minutes, opened several automatic teller machines and fled with an unspecified sum in cash, police said. It was the second attack on the complex in two months. Rio's municipal guards are unarmed. *  BAIDOA, Somalia  --  Somalia's transitional prime minister has granted the U.S. Navy permission to patrol its coastal waters in an effort to combat piracy off the Horn of Africa nation. Ali Mohamed Gedi also said Sunday that the United States would help the nascent government set up a coast guard. --  From News Services"22-Apr-06,NIGERIA (96%); UNITED STATES (93%); FRANCE (92%); NIGER (92%); GERMANY (90%); SENEGAL (79%); UKRAINE (79%); BRAZIL (79%),"Nigeria said Friday that it had paid the last of its multibillion-dollar debt to the Paris Club of creditor nations. ''Nigeria will not owe anybody in the Paris Club one kobo,'' President Olusegun Obasanjo said in a statement earlier this week, referring to a Nigerian unit of currency much like the penny. Nigeria reached a deal last October with the Paris Club, which includes the United States, Germany, France and other wealthy nations, that allowed it to pay off about $30 billion in accumulated debt for about $12 billion, an overall discount of about 60 percent. The government said it paid a final installment of $4.5 billion on Friday, Reuters reported. It plans to use the money it saves to develop the country and reduce poverty. Nigeria committed to using foreign reserves, salted away as oil prices soared, to cancel its debt, which had been racked up during decades of military rule. The repayment is the latest sign that Nigeria's economy, long hobbled by corruption and dominated by a single product -- oil -- is on the rebound. The banking sector, which was crowded with small banks of questionable reliability, was recently consolidated to form about two dozen banks with stronger capitalization. Earlier this year, two credit-rating agencies rated Nigeria's credit as BB-, which is below investment grade but puts it on a par with developing nations like Turkey, Ukraine and Brazil. Debt relief has become a central issue in the fight against poverty. Nigeria, which owed about $36 billion in overall debt, is one of the most indebted nations in the world. With a population of about 130 million, it has more impoverished citizens than any other African nation; per capita gross domestic product stands at roughly $1,000 a year. Yet Nigeria had not been among the nations that have received write-offs or discounts on their debts, as several poor countries have. In part that is because of its reputation for corruption, earned by a succession of military governments that plundered the state treasury, and because Nigeria, with its oil wealth, is seen as being able to pay. Groups that have campaigned for debt cancellation said that the debt Nigeria owed was accumulated under military rulers, and that the current Nigerian government, which was democratically elected and has made fighting corruption a priority, should not be forced to pay. But Nigeria's debt was largely accumulated under civilian governments, and left unpaid by military rulers. Nigeria's vast oil reserves make it one of the world's largest oil producers and the fifth biggest supplier to the United States. Recent political violence in the Niger Delta, an oil-rich region where militants are fighting for greater autonomy, has reduced output by 20 percent. The group, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, claimed responsibility for a car bombing that killed two soldiers on Wednesday. Earlier this week, Mr. Obasanjo announced a huge development project to provide jobs for Niger Delta youths and build a $1.6 billion highway in the region. Wolfowitz Says Debt Deal Is Close By The New York Times The 17 countries will begin receiving the relief, worth close to $1 billion a year over 40 years, on July 1. They are Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guyana, Honduras, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia."27-Apr-06,CHAD (95%); SUDAN (92%); AFRICA (79%),"Four months after suspending all aid to Chad and freezing the country's oil revenue in a high-profile move against corruption, the World Bank reached a compromise that would restore Chad's access to some of its oil funds while requiring the country's leaders to spend much of the money on anti-poverty projects under close supervision. The interim agreement was disclosed in a statement issued by the World Bank last night. The move defuses, at least temporarily, a confrontation between Paul D. Wolfowitz, the World Bank's president, and Idriss Deby, Chad's president, that has emerged as one of the first major tests of Wolfowitz's avowed determination to take a hard line against corrupt governments. At issue is a 650-mile pipeline that the World Bank agreed to help finance in 1999, enabling landlocked Chad to export its oil. The bank trumpeted the project as a showcase for how it could help poor African nations use their natural-resource wealth honestly and effectively by establishing an elaborate system to keep the money from being stolen or squandered. Most of the revenue went into a special fund in London, where it was earmarked for projects such as schools and health clinics. But late last year, the Chadian government unilaterally amended the law governing the use of the petrodollars, saying it needed the funds to beef up its security forces amid a growing refugee problem on its border with Sudan. That presented Wolfowitz with a painful dilemma, because failing to crack down would undermine his anti-corruption campaign, while taking too tough a stance risked a collapse of the Deby regime that could turn Chad into a failed state and a haven for terrorists. On Jan. 6, Wolfowitz announced that he was suspending about $124 million that was due to be disbursed on projects in Chad over several years, and more important to the Chadians, he effectively blocked the government's access to the funds in London. In recent weeks, the security situation in Chad has deteriorated further, with Sudanese forces reportedly invading eastern portions of the country and rebels in the capital staging an attempted coup. Meanwhile, Chad was missing out on more than $100 million in royalties and dividends that it would have gotten under the original arrangement, a source of enormous frustration to Deby, who threatened at one point to stop the flow of oil through the pipeline. The agreement finalized yesterday would give something to both sides. For each of the next three months, Chad would get access to a portion of its frozen oil revenue, while the government would have to take steps to ensure that it was honoring the spirit of the original agreement to channel much of the money into anti-poverty projects. Chad wanted to double, to 30 percent, the portion of the oil revenue that it could use for whatever purposes the government wished, and the bank will go along on that issue. But Deby is retreating on some positions as well. Before getting any money, the government must revise its budget law to show how it will devote the remainder of the funds to projects benefiting the nation's poor. Chad's government is also  agreeing to improve its public finances, including stricter audits of oil revenues. ""Our aim has always been to help the Government improve the basic services Chad's people desperately require,"" Wolfowitz said in the statement. ""Suspending aid was a difficult decision but one the Bank had to take . . .  to ensure that resources went to benefit the poor people of Chad."" Although a final agreement is yet to be reached, ""We believe the steps outlined in this accord provide a way forward to ensure that the people of Chad see the benefits of the aid and oil revenue their country receives,"" he added. The deal leaves some issues unresolved, notably whether Chad would restore a ""future generations fund"" that was established under the original agreement with the World Bank, the aim being to make sure that the country has money left over after its oil runs out."26-May-06,ETHIOPIA (97%); UNITED STATES (92%); UNITED KINGDOM (92%); AFRICA (79%),"The World Bank yesterday approved a new package of loans and grants of up to $1.05 billion for Ethiopia, just a half year after cutting off direct aid to the African nation's government in response to a brutal crackdown on opposition supporters. By giving the aid, the bank overrode critics who view the move as contrary to the democratic ideals espoused by bank President Paul D. Wolfowitz. The aid proposal has presented Wolfowitz with one of the thorniest dilemmas he has faced in the year since he took the World Bank's helm. As a top Pentagon official in the Bush administration, he was a prime advocate of using U.S. power to spread democracy. Although he has said the bank cannot use political criteria in granting assistance, he has stated repeatedly that he believes open and accountable governments offer the best hope for reducing corruption and improving living standards in developing countries. Ethiopia, a nation of 75 million, was one of the favorites of aid donors until its recent crackdown on dissidents. Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, who has led the country since overthrowing its Marxist dictator in 1991, was widely regarded as a visionary leader and was even appointed to a British government commission on reducing poverty and promoting democracy in Africa. The economy has grown at a healthy clip in the past two years, offering some hope for lifting Ethiopians from the ranks of the continent's poorest people. More than half of the population lives on less than $1 a day. But disillusion with Meles set in following elections in May 2005 that spawned violent clashes between civilians and government security forces. Although opposition groups gained a substantial number of parliamentary seats, they contended that the government had used electoral fraud and rule changes to maintain its grip on power. Security forces fired on protesters, killing scores of people, and thousands more were arrested including journalists, top opposition leaders, and intellectuals. Groups such as Human Rights Watch have accused the government of using intimidation and arbitrary detentions to squelch legitimate dissent. Late last year, the World Bank, together with other major donors such as Britain's Department for International Development, decided to withhold about $375 million in direct support for the central government's budget. (The U.S. Agency for International Development does not provide such assistance to Ethiopia.) Now the bank and the donors are re-engaging with Ethiopia but providing a much different form of assistance than before, on the theory that they can continue to aid the country's poor while refraining from bolstering the Meles regime. Instead of lending to the national government as it usually does, the bank will provide $215 million of its new aid to hundreds of local governments, mainly for basic services such as water, health and education. ""It's not a magic solution. It's just a completely different way of doing business,"" Ishac Diwan, the World Bank's country director for Ethiopia, said in an interview. The bank's claim to bypass the national government did not impress groups opposed to Meles, who are heavily represented by members of the Ethiopian diaspora in the Washington area. In anticipation of yesterday's decision, Web sites run by opposition groups have denounced Diwan and the bank for ignoring repression that, they say, worsens the plight of the poor  --  an example being local officials refusing to give fertilizer to farmers who are believed to be opposition sympathizers. ""The fact that they won't channel the money through the central government doesn't change anything,"" said Almaz Zewde, a professor of African Studies at Howard University. ""The central government is everywhere; the local officials are their appointees. . . . In terms of the World Bank's objectives of creating good government, and trying to assist the struggle for human rights and democracy, they are working against that."" She added that although she appreciated being invited to the bank to discuss the issue along with other Meles critics, ""it's regrettable that we are not heard."" Diwan said, however, ""we truly put good governance at the center"" of the aid program. Quarterly reviews will assess whether money is being disbursed regardless of beneficiaries' political affiliations, he said, and the government has agreed to release an unprecedented amount of information about how it is spending money at all levels, ""so people can lobby for good services."""15-Jul-06,CHAD (94%); AFRICA (93%); SUDAN (79%),"The World Bank and Chad have resolved a dispute over the use of Chad's oil revenue, defusing a clash that has tested the anti-corruption credentials of the bank's president, Paul D. Wolfowitz. The agreement, announced by the bank yesterday, was made possible in part because the soaring price of oil presents Chad, one of Africa's most impoverished nations, with an unanticipated windfall. The pact concerns a 650-mile pipeline that the bank helped finance in 1999 so landlocked Chad could export its oil. Skeptics warned that riches from such projects almost always line the pockets of corrupt elites, but the bank vowed to make Chad a showcase for how it could help African nations use their natural-resource wealth to help the poor. Under yesterday's accord, Chad has promised that 70 percent of its budgetary resources in 2007 will go for poverty-reduction purposes  --  a wide range of programs including health, education, infrastructure, de-mining and rural development. ""This is a huge step forward,"" Wolfowitz said, because the government of President Idriss Deby is pledging that all its oil-related revenue will go to those programs, not just the royalties specified in previous agreements. But Ian Gary, a policy adviser for the anti-poverty group Oxfam America and longtime critic of the project, said that with the government now likely to reap far more petrodollars than previously assumed, he is more concerned than ever about the danger of waste and pilferage. ""There's a huge windfall that wasn't expected, wasn't planned for, and certainly is going to test the budget system in a country where that system is already broken,"" Gary said. Battles with the Deby regime over its use of oil money presented Wolfowitz with one of his biggest challenges since he took the bank presidency in June 2005. Having vowed to crack down on corruption, he was obliged to take a tough line but concerned about causing the collapse of Chad's government, which would risk turning the country into a failed state and a haven for terrorists. Until late last year, most of the royalties paid by oil companies to the government went into a special fund in London, where they were earmarked for such projects as schools and health clinics. But Deby unilaterally ended that arrangement, saying he needed more money for his security forces as rebellions flared and refugees poured across the border from Sudan. Wolfowitz responded on Jan. 6 by effectively blocking the government's access to the London fund. An interim accord in April, intended to last three months, freed some of that money. The new agreement could be the foundation of a more permanent arrangement and is an attempt to deal with additional taxes that the government is getting from the oil companies because of high petroleum prices. While about $400 million in royalties went into the London account from the start of production in 2003 through 2005, indirect taxes on higher-price oil  --  which weren't subject to any controls  --  will give the government an estimated $1.5 billion next year."15-Jul-06,CHAD (95%); SUDAN (92%); SENEGAL (79%); CAMEROON (79%); UNITED STATES (79%),"The World Bank has reached an agreement with Chad over how to spend the profits of the nation's booming oil industry, with Chad promising to earmark 70 percent of the money to fight poverty. The agreement, announced by the bank on Friday, ends a dispute that threatened to kill an experimental arrangement in which the World Bank agreed to invest in Chad's oil industry if the bulk of the proceeds went toward alleviating poverty. Its aim was to break the so-called resource curse, whereby mineral-rich nations watch their wealth get siphoned by corrupt officials while poverty deepens among the rest of the population. Chad, a vast, landlocked African nation with three times the area of California, ranked last, alongside Bangladesh, on the watchdog group Transparency International's 2005 index of corruption perceptions, meaning the two nations were viewed as the most corrupt. Chad is also one of the world's poorest nations. The new agreement brings a greater portion of Chad's oil revenue under the control of an independent oversight committee, but also gives the government freer reign to spend the money on things like electricity and telecommunications, rather than traditional poverty programs. ''This is a huge step forward,'' said Paul D. Wolfowitz, president of the World Bank, in a statement. The World Bank agreed to help pay for a $4 billion pipeline to carry oil from fields in the south of Chad to Cameroon long before oil prices boomed. Back then, Chad's distant, hard-to-reach fields were not an appealing investment for private companies. Exxon Mobil, the American oil company working in Chad, ultimately agreed to develop the fields, but only with the World Bank's help. In 2000, the bank approved the project and lent Chad $37 million for its stake in the pipeline. Under the agreement, the royalties were to be deposited in an offshore account, and an independent oversight committee was to vet, approve and monitor all spending. The oil began flowing in mid-2004, funneling more than $400 million to Chad. But in October 2005, Chad's government abruptly announced that it planned to put more money into its general budget, avoiding the oversight panel, and that it would increase its spending on security. The government said it was facing a fiscal crisis and a rebel uprising in the eastern provinces that border the volatile Darfur region of Sudan. The World Bank responded by suspending its loans to Chad. After negotiations, a compromise was reached in which the government would be able to spend more money on security and scrap a fund created to salt away oil money for future generations. The new agreement covers 2007 only, according to World Bank officials. A final agreement to deal with Chad's oil revenue will be discussed next year, they said."4-Aug-06,NIGERIA (94%); AFRICA (92%),"  One of Nigeria's best-known and reform-minded government ministers resigned after a cabinet shuffle left her stripped of most of the authority she had when she reshaped Nigeria's economic policies. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, left, a former World Bank vice president, was finance minister for three years and was instrumental in negotiating a deal to use the windfall Nigeria received from oil prices to build a $30 billion reserve account and pay off billions of dollars in foreign debt at a cut rate. She was recruited by President Olusegun Obasanjo to burnish Nigeria's image, particularly with international financial institutions, and was the most powerful in a clique of officials charged with battling rampant corruption. Then in June she was appointed foreign minister, an ostensibly prestigious post largely unconnected to her economic training, though she retained the portfolio of shepherding the economy. That responsibility was transferred to another official this week. A government statement said Ms. Okonjo-Iweala was resigning to attend to ''pressing family issues.''   LYDIA POLGREEN (NYT)"12-Aug-06,KENYA (98%),"A day after the World Bank's top official in Kenya said he had been shaken down for a bribe during a traffic stop, the Kenyan authorities said nothing improper happened and accused the official on Friday of acting ''above the law.'' According to a Kenyan police report, Colin Bruce, the World Bank's country director for Kenya, who has crusaded against corruption, was approaching downtown Nairobi on Thursday afternoon when police officers stopped his driver for speeding. The officers said that according to their radar gun, Mr. Bruce's car was going 72 miles an hour, more than twice the legal limit. The police officers began to write a ticket, but when they asked the driver to post the equivalent of $54 for bail, Mr. Bruce accused them of trying to solicit a bribe and refused to cooperate, the police report said. He then called the head of Kenya's anti-corruption squad on his cellphone. Several other motorists who had also been stopped for speeding joined the protest and started yelling at the police, quickly drawing a scene of reporters and onlookers. Kenya is notorious for corruption, especially among police officers, and the government recently established the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission to respond to complaints. Mr. Bruce has spoken out many times about the level of graft here. Earlier this year, the World Bank delayed more than $250 million in loans to Kenya, saying the government was not doing enough to end corruption. A team of anti-corruption officers soon arrived at the roadside where Mr. Bruce was arguing with the police and arrested five policemen and drove them away in a van. Police officials said they were humiliated by what happened. ''It is totally unacceptable to interrupt a police operation like this,'' Gideon M. Kibunjah, a spokesman for the Kenyan Police, said Friday. Mr. Kibunjah said the policemen had not been asking for a bribe but for a standard amount of cash bail to ensure that the ticketed motorists would show up in court. ''It was perfectly legal,'' he said. ''We give receipts and everything.'' He said Mr. Bruce had insulted the policemen and should not act ''above the law.'' The police department also issued a stiffly worded statement that said, ''the reason for his displeasure was that the police had the audacity to stop his car.'' The statement went on to commend the policemen for ''their professionalism in the face of blatant provocation.'' Mr. Bruce did not return phone calls for comment."14-Sep-06,UNITED STATES (92%); IRAQ (92%); KENYA (92%); SINGAPORE (79%); INDONESIA (79%),"In his first 15 months as president of the World Bank, Paul D. Wolfowitz has made the fight against corruption in poor countries a hallmark issue, waging an aggressive campaign that has led to the suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and contracts to nations including India, Chad, Kenya, Congo, Ethiopia and Bangladesh. It is a new incarnation for Mr. Wolfowitz, a neoconservative intellectual who was a primary architect of the Iraq war during four years as deputy secretary of defense. At the World Bank, Mr. Wolfowitz, 62, has maintained an assertive but soft-spoken style, saying recently that the bank's mission was ''to send children to school, to help mothers be healthier, to provide jobs for poor people -- not to have resources siphoned off into the hands of the corrupt and greedy.'' In recent months, however, his campaign has run into a host of critics, both at the bank and among financial officials outside the United States, who say that developing countries are being threatened with arbitrary punishment in a way that jeopardizes the bank's longtime mission to reduce poverty. Few here at the World Bank dispute the idea that corruption is a serious problem, but the rift over Mr. Wolfowitz's approach has grown deep and bitter, according to more than a dozen bank officials interviewed recently. The backlash at the bank against Mr. Wolfowitz's approach centers not on his intentions or goals, but on a widespread fear that countries will be categorized in the future as corrupt or not corrupt, and that lending will be shut off in a selective way. ''Anticorruption efforts are an essential part of development finance,'' said Roberto Danino, a senior vice president of the bank until early this year. ''But getting rid of corruption is not a silver bullet. The bank should not overemphasize its anticorruption agenda at the expense of other policies required for development.'' Mr. Wolfowitz acknowledges that his decisions to suspend or delay loans, contracts and debt relief funds for many countries have provoked outcries, but he says that in almost every case, the funds were restored after safeguards were set up. He has begun firing back at the critics at internal meetings and in public statements. He notes, for example, that the bank's lending under his leadership actually rose slightly last year, to nearly $23 billion. Mr. Wolfowitz says he has tried to rebut what he calls the myth that combating fraud is ''somehow at odds with development or becomes an excuse not to provide assistance.'' While no one knows how much of the bank's resources have been improperly diverted, informal estimates range from 10 percent to the 25 percent that Mr. Wolfowitz says went to corrupt cronies and family members of Indonesia's leadership in the 1990's. During the Reagan administration, Mr. Wolfowitz served as assistant secretary of state for East Asia, and, in the Clinton years, as dean of the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. Some bank officials say that the widespread concern about Mr. Wolfowitz's approach reflects lingering doubts among many international aid specialists about his selection for the bank post by President Bush. The doubts center on Mr. Wolfowitz's role as a leading advocate of the American invasion of Iraq, with many critics contending that his zeal on corruption reminds them of what they say was his messianic but unrealistic faith that installing democracy by force in Iraq, and by other means through the Middle East, would bring stability to the region. The criticism has been especially sharp among Europeans at the bank, where many officials say that judgments about what constitutes ''good governance'' could rupture the bank's delicate relationships with aid recipients, especially if the judgments are based on information gathered from dissidents and other critics in those countries. ''We must not use corruption as an excuse for a massive withdrawal of our help,'' a senior French finance official involved in discussions with the bank said. The official was among many who agreed to discuss the internal debate only on condition of anonymity. In recent months, Mr. Wolfowitz and his aides have been negotiating with skeptical members of the bank's board of 24 executive directors from around the world on guidelines for handling corruption issues. Several of the meetings have been contentious, participants say. This week, the board forwarded a draft of the guidelines and policies for approval by the world's finance ministers at the annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which begins Thursday in Singapore. But many officials said they expected the arguments to continue there and into the future. Several longtime bank officials say they cannot remember when board members wrangled over the wording of a policy paper with a bank president. At recent meetings, directors demanded that Mr. Wolfowitz agree to a greater role for the board in any future decisions on cutting off aid. In addition, members forced the deletion of language suggesting that the United Nations' goal of reducing world poverty 50 percent by 2015 would have to take second place to the bank's drive against corruption. Still, Britain and other European and developing countries remain skeptical on what may happen when the document is approved, bank officials said. ''The bank,'' a board member said, ''should not become a world policeman pointing its moral finger and conditioning everything on whether or not a country is believed to be corrupt. The more the bank goes beyond its old mandate of reducing poverty, the more problems will come up.'' In an interview, Mr. Wolfowitz acknowledged that the idea of drafting a paper on bank corruption policies had been urged on him out of fear that he would punish countries without consulting the board. He said he did not take the criticism as personally directed at him or his record on Iraq. ''I think some of the board members,'' Mr. Wolfowitz said, ''are legitimately afraid that as soon as you start criticizing, the next thing you're going to do is wag your finger and say, 'You're not going to get money unless you behave.' That's not our objective. Our objective is to make the lending go up.'' Past actions taken on behalf of the bank have involved a variety of presumed improprieties. For example, aides to Mr. Wolfowitz said he suspended debt relief talks with Congo because he was dissatisfied with audits of its state oil company. They said he expressed indignation over news reports about extravagant hotel bills incurred by Congo's president during United Nations General Assembly meetings in New York last September. The bank has looked at, among other things, accusations of corrupt bidding practices for road projects in Bangladesh, kickbacks to politicians in Argentina and the resignation of high officials in Kenya linked to projects there. By all accounts, a pivotal moment in Mr. Wolfowitz's campaign came last year when the bank suspended $800 million in loans for maternal and children's health in India in response to assertions that illicit payments had been going to officials. Nancy Boswell, president of Transparency International USA, a nongovernmental monitoring group that strongly supports Mr. Wolfowitz's efforts on corruption, said, ''It sent a tremor through the bank that Wolfowitz was serious, that he was going to ask hard questions, look at the track record of countries and make some changes.'' But many at the bank complained that the action had been taken without consultation, and protests were lodged by top aides to Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, bank officials said. Few would characterize the bank's 10,000 employees, 70 percent of whom work in Washington, as enthusiastic supporters of the Bush administration. Since taking office, Mr. Wolfowitz has told staff members that he wants to listen to them. He has impressed many with his trips to Africa and advocacy of debt relief for the poorest countries. But distrust of Mr. Wolfowitz remains high, in part because, according to some, he has not given enough credit to his predecessor, James D. Wolfensohn, who spoke out against corruption and set up the bank's first investigative unit in the late 1990's. When Mr. Wolfowitz arrived, he acknowledged Mr. Wolfensohn's efforts, but also complained that the fraud unit had more than 300 unresolved cases. He increased its budget nearly 50 percent and appointed a new director. He has also set up a program for companies to disclose bribes they paid in order to avoid sanctions. Currently, about 330 companies accused of corruption have been barred from bank-financed business or been otherwise penalized. The bank is trying to get nations and other international aid agencies to take similar action. Mr. Wolfowitz's management style also grates on some bank officials, with a number of them complaining that he has relied on a small coterie of loyal aides. ''He presumes,'' said Mr. Danino, the former bank senior vice president and once prime minister of Peru, ''that anyone who opposes him is either incompetent or corrupt.'' But supporters say Mr. Wolfowitz is determined to shake up the bank and was inspired to move on corruption by staff members, especially those posted outside Washington and Europe. They say he has had to battle a mentality that emphasizes loan programs, not crackdowns on corrupt individuals. ''Let's face it, promotion at the World Bank comes from spending money,'' said John Githongo, a onetime campaigner against corruption in Kenya who has fled to safety in Britain and is now an adviser to Mr. Wolfowitz. ''If you're in the field, and too many complaints about corruption interrupt the spending, it has an impact on your career trajectory.''

""Fragile"" countries, whose deepening poverty puts them at risk from terrorism, armed conflict and epidemic disease, have jumped to 26 from 17 since the report was last issued in 2003. Five states graduated off the list, but 14 made new appearances, including Nigeria and seven other African countries, Kosovo, Cambodia, East Timor, and the West Bank and Gaza. Twelve states, including Afghanistan, Somalia and Sudan, made both lists. ""Past international engagement with these countries has failed to yield significant improvements,"" said the assessment released by the World Bank's Independent Evaluation Group, which reports on the bank's programs to the board of directors. It was timed to coincide with the annual meeting of the bank and the International Monetary Fund this month in Singapore. Hurdles facing the countries at risk, often referred to as ""failed"" or ""failing"" states, include ""weak security, fractured societal relations, corruption, breakdown in the rule of law, lack of mechanisms for generating legitimate power and authority"" and limited investment resources to meet basic needs, the report said. To avoid ""adverse spillover effects  --  such as conflict, terrorism and epidemic diseases  --  the international community and the Bank need to find more effective ways"" of assisting them, it said. The Bush administration has described failing states as a major threat to U.S. security. ""The danger they pose is now unparalleled,"" Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice wrote in a column that appeared late last year in The Washington Post. ""Absent responsible state authority, threats that would and should be contained within a country's borders can now melt into the world and wreak untold havoc. ""Weak and failing states,"" Rice said, ""serve as global pathways that facilitate the spread of pandemics, the movement of criminals and terrorists, and the proliferation of the world's most dangerous weapons."" The administration's updated counterterrorism strategy, published earlier this month, set economic development in ""failing states or states emerging from conflict"" as a key objective. Official U.S. foreign assistance to the least developed countries topped $27 billion in 2005, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, more than twice the level when Bush took office. That amount places the United States first among international donor nations in terms of absolute dollars, although Washington remains at the bottom when aid is tallied as a percentage of gross national product. The United States also scores higher than many other countries in the percentage of its aid that is spent on security, trade and food supplies rather than on more traditional forms of development efforts. In a major restructuring, the administration is increasingly directing assistance toward those countries whose governments are judged as heading in a positive direction in terms of institutional and economic development and U.S. security interests. In 2002, the World Bank launched its own initiative to expand assistance to fragile states and increased its lending to them by 67 percent, to $4.1 billion, between 2003 and 2005. Its report cited a number of lessons learned in the process. In several countries, there was either too much aid or too little. Assistance from all international donors, the report said, varied from nearly $200 per capita for East Timor to $15 per capita for the Central African Republic. In a number of cases, an influx of aid was not matched by a domestic reform agenda that would allow the country to adequately utilize it. In other countries, donors demanded too many reforms, too quickly. In Afghanistan, the report said, ""donor reforms have not been selective enough and have led to 120 pieces of legislation."" Donors sometimes disagreed about the goals of overlapping aid programs, making it ""difficult to achieve policy coherence"" in recipient countries, the report said. ""In Afghanistan, for example, the Ministry of Finance receives technical assistance for customs modernization from the Bank, USAID, the European Union"" and Britain's development aid program."27-Sep-06,SINGAPORE (92%); AFRICA (92%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%),"NEARLY 16 months into his tenure as president of the World Bank, Paul D. Wolfowitz is doing poorly. He has alienated the bank's professional staff with unpopular personnel decisions, and he has alienated some prominent clients and important shareholders. At the World Bank's annual meeting in Singapore last week, the British government sought to diminish Mr. Wolfowitz's authority to implement his anti-corruption strategy. It's not surprising that this strategy, a centerpiece of Mr. Wolfowitz's tenure, should provoke controversy. Refusing to tolerate corruption is bound to annoy borrowers and contractors who are exposed as dishonest. Mr. Wolfowitz has made a sensitive challenge more difficult by giving the impression that his anti-corruption zeal might not be applied consistently around  the world, and by failing to provide a convincing explanation of how corruption can be reduced. The World Bank's evaluation department has found few measurable gains from anti-corruption programs over the past decade. Some experts conclude that targeting corruption is futile. Mr. Wolfowitz has brought many of his problems on himself, but he must be given a chance to carry out his agenda. The British move to impose tougher oversight risks suffocating the World Bank, which is already half-throttled by shareholder meddling. And although it is hard to make headway against corruption, nobody should doubt that it is crucial to do so. Two decades ago, development experts were content to focus on macroeconomic policies, believing that competitive currencies and stable prices would attract investment, spark growth and reduce poverty. But often the expected private investment failed to materialize because of other obstacles to doing business in poor parts of the world, from bureaucratic red tape to corruption. However ingrained these problems are, progress remains possible. The World Bank's recent Doing Business report, which tracks impediments to investment in 175 countries, shows an encouraging tide of pro-business reform,  even in Africa. Two out of three sub-Saharan African countries carried out some kind of pro-business reform between January 2005 and April 2006. Many of these measures diminished opportunities for corruption. In the 1980s,  critics complained that the macroeconomic prescriptions of development experts were  harsh and unlikely to be successful. But the reforms did largely succeed in taming inflation and restoring rational price signals. Similarly, it is too early to lose faith in the idea that corruption and other problems of weak governance can be tackled. Mr. Wolfowitz has chosen a reasonable focus. He deserves the space to pursue it."3-Oct-06,AFRICA (95%); EQUATORIAL GUINEA (94%); UNITED STATES (92%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%),"The founding president of this country was a witch doctor who murdered tens of thousands, put enemies' heads on pikes, denounced education and spread land mines on the road out of his country to prevent people from fleeing. This was then so vile a place that an American diplomat stabbed another to death here in 1971 and claimed in his trial that he had been driven insane partly by the screams of all the people being tortured. When the president was finally ousted in 1979, he ran off into the bush with $60 million packed in suitcases. But he was pursued, and in a shootout, the nation's entire foreign exchange reserves burned up. This little country of Equatorial Guinea was, therefore, a useful place to visit with Casey Parks, the student journalist who won a contest to accompany me on this trip -- because it underscores one of the biggest challenges facing Africa today. That is the need for better governance, meaning both less corruption and better economic policies. The single greatest need to fight poverty and injustice isn't more aid, although that is needed. What matters most is the local decision makers. The single biggest reason Africa is so poor is that it has had unusually bad leadership -- a reflection, in turn, of colonial misrule. Equatorial Guinea traditionally has been Africa's poster boy for bad governance. Even after the old witch doctor was ousted, the kleptocracy continued under Teodoro Obiang, the current president. A new book about the country, ''The Wonga Coup,'' notes that in 2004 President Obiang bought a Boeing 737, one of six personal planes, for $55 million, and outfitted it with a king-sized bed and gold-plated fittings in the extra-large bathroom. Schools and clinics are needy, but Forbes lists President Obiang as the world's eighth richest ruler, with a net worth of $600 million. Just last year, ''The Wonga Coup'' says, the president's son spent the equivalent of a third of his country's entire education budget on a vacation home in South Africa and three cars -- two Bentleys and a Lamborghini. That is grotesque, but it is changing. Here in Equatorial Guinea, torture has diminished, and two opposition members of Parliament provide token public criticism. The government is participating in Tony Blair's anticorruption initiative (a terrific program to help poor countries), and Prime Minister Ricardo Mangue told me that his government would begin publishing budgets to try to ensure more transparency. We should help developing countries broadly, not just by writing checks but also by holding their feet to the fire on corruption and economic reform. An excellent new U.S. aid program, the Millennium Challenge Accounts, rewards good governance, and we can do even more. For example, as Joseph Stiglitz notes in his new book, ''Making Globalization Work,'' the West can modify bank secrecy rules so that it is harder for dictators to pillage their lands. The time is right, because all across Africa, countries are increasing efforts to fight corruption and improve the investment climate. The World Bank's latest ''Doing Business'' report shows that some African countries, particularly Tanzania, Ghana, Rwanda and Nigeria, are among the world leaders in reforming their economies. And where African countries have had sustained good governance, economies have boomed. Examples include Botswana, Mozambique, Rwanda and Mauritius, which in turn are becoming models for neighbors. Partly as a result, Africa is enjoying an overall economic growth rate this year of 5 to 6 percent, twice that of the U.S. And Africa now has a huge opportunity to move up the ladder into low-wage manufacturing, because Chinese labor costs are rising and some labor-intensive production is being shipped to lower-wage countries. Chinese traders are now everywhere in Africa, although they haven't set up many factories so far. Senegal has snared a share of the French-language call-center industry, and a few countries, like Mauritius, Lesotho and Namibia, make garments, but manufacturers have generally shunned Africa because of concerns about infrastructure, political instability, corruption and ability to scale up production. If Africa plays its cards right, that could change. So, yes, Africa is still afflicted by AIDS, misery and the tyranny of ''big men'' whose sons squander national treasure on Lamborghinis. But leadership is improving, opportunities are appearing, and there's something new in the air: reform, and hope."24-Nov-06,NIGERIA (99%); AFRICA (92%); UNITED STATES (79%); ZIMBABWE (79%),"Early one Sunday morning in June, a mysterious text message flashed across Kayode Fayemi's cellphone. ''Since you continue to oppose Governor Fayose, we shall kill you,'' the message read, referring to the bare-knuckled incumbent at the time, Ayo Fayose. It was signed, ''THE FAYOSE M SQUAD.'' Mr. Fayemi, a candidate for governor in this tiny state in southwest Nigeria, tried to brush off the threat. But if there was any doubt what the M in the message stood for, it evaporated six weeks later, when another candidate for governor, a World Bank consultant, was stabbed and bludgeoned to death in his bed. So lucrative is public office here that even in a backwater like Ekiti, a state of only 2 million people in a nation of 130 million, the state house and the spoils that come with it are apparently worth killing for. Of Nigeria's 36 governors, 31 are under federal investigation, mostly on suspicion of corruption, and 5 have already been impeached, including Mr. Fayose in October. He is now in hiding. ''This is democracy at work in Nigeria,'' Mr. Fayemi muttered as he drove between campaign stops in Ekiti in early November. ''Murder and money, violence and fraud.'' It has been seven boisterous years since Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation and an anchor for the entire region, shed its military rule and ostensibly became a democracy. But the transformation has been slow and stumbling, hobbled by a political culture of graft and intimidation that has led to widespread neglect and disillusionment. Despite some progress by the government of President Olusegun Obasanjo in fighting corruption and improving the economy, Nigerians are deeply disappointed with how their country has turned out. In 2000, suffused with the euphoria of new freedoms, 84 percent of Nigerians said they were satisfied with the state of their new democracy, according to the Afrobarometer public opinion survey. But six years later, the same survey found that just 25 percent of Nigerians felt that way. New democracies naturally suffer from the letdown of high expectations, but the drop in Nigeria is virtually unparalleled on the continent. Of the 12 African countries surveyed in 2005, only Zimbabwe, which the Bush administration has called an ''outpost of tyranny,'' had a lower score. ''Confidence in the new democracy has crashed,'' said Peter Lewis, director of the African Studies program at Johns Hopkins University, who was among the researchers who conducted the survey. ''Nigerians expected a democratic dividend in 1999. They expected more economic opportunity and better governance.'' In small states like Ekiti, it is plain to see why confidence in democracy has fallen so far, so fast. Nowhere is Nigeria's democracy in deeper trouble than at the state and local levels, where the most bruising contests for power take place in a bloody, winner-take-all system in which the voters are all but superfluous. ''Greedy politicians are literally killing their own people by stealing the money for health care, for schools, for clean water, for everything the state should provide its people,'' said Sola Adeyeye, a member of Nigeria's national assembly who once served as a local government chairman. In April, Nigeria is to hold its next election, choosing a president, governors and legislators in its third contest since making the transition to civilian rule in 1999, after 16 years of military domination. Though the election is still months away, political chaos and electoral violence are already gripping the nation. The main political parties hold primaries in December, and the ruling People's Democratic Party may splinter over its nominee. The wave of impeachments has left statehouses in disarray and sparked violence that has killed dozens. If Mr. Obasanjo, who is barred from running again by the Constitution, successfully passes the baton to an elected president next spring, it will be the first time this troubled giant of a nation has handed over power from one civilian government to another. That would cement its place in the growing family of democratic nations in Africa and further stabilize an uneasy corner of the globe. But if the election fails -- and there are indications that it might, given the political chaos, electoral violence and lagging voter registration -- analysts worry that a number of grim possibilities could play out, including a military takeover that could steer the country back toward despotism. Failure would have broad consequences. One in six Africans is Nigerian. Nigeria is the fifth largest supplier of oil to the United States. It is the economic, social and political fulcrum on which West Africa balances. Mr. Fayemi, the gubernatorial candidate here in Ekiti, says he hopes to transform the political culture. He spent much of the 1990s in exile opposing military rule, and now brings his resume, studded with graduate degrees and international accomplishments, to the local political scene. He also has a network of high-level contacts that includes, among many others, the liberal American financier George Soros, whom he befriended while serving on the board of Mr. Soros's Open Society Justice Initiative. ''We have allowed our politics to be so debased by money and violence that of course nothing but misery can come of it,'' Mr. Fayemi said. ''It is the politics of the belly, and it is destroying us.'' To spend a few days with him on the campaign trail is to experience democracy as it is lived for most Nigerians. It is not pretty. The leaders of Nigeria's 36 states are princes of a political system that rewards executive power and does little to curb corruption. Governors get a check each month that represents their state's cut of Nigeria's booming oil fortune, and have almost no one to answer to for how they spend the money. Here in the state of Ekiti, that check is typically $14 million, but lately it has been more than double that because of soaring oil prices. In a tiny state like this, that money could go far toward meeting the basic needs of the population -- schools, roads, health clinics, running water. In reality, many governors steal with impunity, buying the loyalty of the legislature and using state money to erect systems of patronage that help keep incumbents in office, analysts and political leaders say. Ekiti's most recent governor, Mr. Fayose, is a case in point. In October, he was impeached after an investigation found that he and his associates had pocketed millions from the state treasury. In one instance, he is alleged to have spent close to $7 million, mostly in contracts to political allies, supposedly for a poultry farming project, but the money simply disappeared and the project has yet to produce a single egg. Several of his top aides have been arrested in connection with the killing of the gubernatorial candidate in August. A report by a presidential security panel last year said that Mr. Fayose ''has zero tolerance for opposition,'' ''consistently sets in motion activities that will lead to violent acts'' and ''is said to be a user of hard drugs, which makes him to be highly unpredictable.'' ''Under this man we lived in a state of siege,'' said Dipo Kolawole, a top administrator at the University of Ado Ekiti. ''It was worse than colonialism, worse than military rule. He was never the choice of the people. He imposed himself upon us.'' While international observers ultimately deemed them to be largely free and fair, Nigeria's last two elections were marred by widespread allegations of ballot stuffing, intimidation and fraud. In 2003, Mr. Fayose bullied his way into power in Ekiti by paying off party bosses and using the police to intimidate opponents, according to analysts and political leaders here. Mr. Fayose's excesses were so egregious that, even though he was a member of the ruling People's Democratic Party, he has since been repudiated as an ''error'' by Mr. Obasanjo. But even now, with Mr. Fayose and his style of politics discredited, candidates in Ekiti are expected to spread cash around. Mr. Fayemi's campaign treads the treacherous middle ground between the high road, on which pro-democracy advocates have traditionally marched directly to defeat, and the bruising, money-driven politics that dominate Nigeria's electoral contests. Mr. Fayemi has spent freely on this election, handing out stacks of Naira notes as donations to local party organizations, with extra thrown in for the women and youth sections. On a recent campaign swing, he handed out nearly 500,000 Naira, or $4,000, in a single day. He estimates that winning the election will cost him 4 million Naira, a sum he has raised from allies and friends in Nigeria, as well as from his contacts in the West. As he crisscrosses Ekiti's rutted roads, Mr. Fayemi navigates the messy world of Nigerian politics. At a meeting with the bosses of his party, the opposition Action Congress, he knelt before them to receive their blessing. He promised development projects, like a local polytechnic, and handed out fat envelopes of cash at another party meeting. The money was intended as a donation to the local party machinery, but what actually happens to it is anyone's guess. After one rally, as Mr. Fayemi tried to leave town, a fracas erupted among some youths who crowded around his car. A dozen young men began arguing with one of his aides and blocking the car. Apparently the campaign had given money for a local youth wing to a man no one could identify, and he had absconded with the cash. Mr. Fayemi would need to pay them again, the young men explained, surrounding his car as they pressed their case. Mr. Fayemi threw up his hands. It had been a long day of hectic and sometimes antagonistic meetings with party bosses. ''This is what we live with,'' he said. The aide argued with the young men, but their mood darkened as the dispute stretched for several minutes. Finally, Mr. Fayemi relented. ''Just pay them,'' he said. The leader of the young men seized the stack of cash, carefully counting the notes in the glow of the car's headlights: 10,000 Naira, or about $80. Once he confirmed the amount and nodded his assent, a cry went up. ''Excellency, Excellency!'' the young men shouted, using the honorific for governors, opening the cordon and allowing Mr. Fayemi's car to pass through. ''This is our politics,'' Mr. Fayemi said, an edge of disgust in his voice. Such payoffs clearly make him uncomfortable, but he said he hoped that the ends would justify the means. Once installed in the governor's office, he says he can begin to change the political culture. But first he has to get elected. ''Money,'' Mr. Fayemi said. ''It is the language of Nigerian politics. As much as you want to get away from that, you also have to be mindful of those short-term things you must do.''

The bank's strategy in Senegal, for example, favors cities, while in Malawi the bank neglects efforts to help the rural poor improve productivity on and off the farm, the report says. The evaluation team found that in about half the 48 countries it studied across the developing world, the bank's aid to rural areas produced disappointing results. The bank's managers, in a written response in the report, said they shared the team's concerns and had strengthened the focus on rural poverty and increased lending for rural development in recent years. The evaluation team's critique was part of a broad assessment of the bank's performance that concluded that it tended to spread itself too thin, underestimate resistance to its efforts to combat corruption and patronage, and pay too little attention to ensuring that economic growth improved the lot of the poor. The Independent Evaluation Group, which produced the report, answers to the bank's board, not to its president, Paul D. Wolfowitz, or its management. The report, its annual review, laid out arresting examples of the bank's shortcomings. As the bank has sought to increase access to education in poor countries, the report says, it has paid too little attention to learning outcomes. In Uganda, for example, attendance has soared since the country made primary education free in 1996. But now, 94 children are in each classroom and three students share each textbook. Vikram Nehru, speaking for the bank's management, replied that the bank had tried to reach both goals. ''We ourselves are not satisfied with the improvements in quality, not that we haven't tried,'' he said. Education has been a priority for Mr. Wolfowitz, the Bush administration's choice to lead the bank, but he is even more identified with fighting corruption in the developing world. The evaluation team found that though the bank had encouraged countries to adopt anticorruption laws and had helped finance agencies to carry them out, the agencies often had little enforcement capability. Similarly, the bank has financed efforts to professionalize the civil service in countries where the political will to follow through is lacking. The bank's management said it agreed with much of the analysis of its record on civil service reform and anticorruption measures. The bank is now more focused on improving the management of particular public services, Mr. Nehru said. It is also trying to stir public demand for better government by working with private groups and research organizations in developing countries."10-Dec-06,UNITED STATES (91%); ALBANIA (79%); EGYPT (79%); CHAD (79%); NORDIC COUNTRIES (53%); BULGARIA (52%),"Social scientists who study corruption have long debated the relative importance of legal incentives and cultural norms (''people like us don't do that'') in the decision to act for or against the public good. Many economists lean toward the view that most people will act similarly, given similar incentives, and that cultural norms are less important. In an ingenious study published in June, however, the Columbia University economist Raymond Fisman and Edward Miguel of the University of California at Berkeley argued that culture plays a powerful role. The two scholars studied parking tickets that were racked up in Manhattan by diplomats from 146 countries who were posted to the United Nations. In a situation in which every diplomat essentially received an invitation to be corrupt, diplomats from nations with ''clean'' governments said, ''No, thanks.'' The study began with the observation that, until late 2002, there was essentially zero enforcement of parking rules where diplomats were concerned. Diplomats were ticketed, but few if any cars were towed, and no one demanded payment. Using public records stretching back to 1997, Fisman and Miguel identified which diplomats had delinquent tickets, and how many -- 150,000 in all, representing more than $18 million in fines. If incentives trumped culture, you would suppose that diplomats from every nation would cheat. But in fact, attaches from Canada, Ireland, Scandinavian nations and Japan evidently drove around the block till they found a spot. (Diplomats with few or no unpaid tickets also tended to get few tickets, period.) The worst offenders, meanwhile, came from Kuwait (246 unpaid tickets per diplomat), Egypt, Chad, Sudan, Bulgaria, Mozambique, Albania, Angola and Senegal. This behavior correlated strongly with the scores of diplomats' home countries on a measure of public corruption compiled by World Bank researchers. Of course, legal incentives were hardly irrelevant: over time, individual diplomats from ''clean'' countries did cheat more, as they learned how the system worked. But the initial scofflaws' cheating grew even faster. (An interesting side note: the more anti-American the population of a diplomat's home country, the more likely he or she got tickets.) Diplomats, Fisman and Miguel concluded, ''bring the social norms or corruption culture of their home countries with them.''    CHRISTOPHER SHEA  URL: http://www.nytimes.com"23-Dec-06,NIGERIA (94%); AFRICA (92%); SWITZERLAND (90%),"  Nigeria has invested the $500 million stolen from state coffers by the 1990's dictator Gen. Sani Abacha and his family and returned to the Nigerian government by Switzerland in roads, power, health, education and water, according to the World Bank, which monitored the spending to ensure that the money was not stolen by officials again. In a report, the bank said it was the first time that looted resources had been returned to an African country. The bank's president, Paul D. Wolfowitz, has repeatedly stressed that wealthy countries have played a role in African corruption by participating in crooked transactions.   CELIA W. DUGGER"14-Feb-07,AFRICA (98%); MALI (93%); SUDAN (91%); UNITED STATES (79%); BELGIUM (57%); FRANCE (54%),"I have never seen a film quite like ''Bamako,'' Abderrahmane Sissako's seething, complicated and disarmingly beautiful investigation of Africa's social, economic and human crises. The agony of Africa has been explored, and exploited, in several high-profile recent documentaries and fictional features, from ''God Grew Tired of Us,'' about the ''lost boys'' of Sudan, to ''Blood Diamond'' and ''The Constant Gardener.'' ''Bamako'' is something different: a work of cool intelligence and profound anger, a long, dense, argument that is also a haunting visual poem. Mr. Sissako, a Malian director whose previous films include ''Life on Earth'' and ''Waiting for Happiness,'' does not try to engage the pity of the audience through sad stories or terrible images. Rather, he tackles the central question of the film -- have the ostensible good intentions of the West, in particular the World Bank and similar institutions, contributed to the impoverishment and demoralization of the continent? -- calmly and systematically, though with evident passion. His conceit is at once simple and daring, straightforward and more than a little surreal. In a courtyard in a poor section of Bamako, Mali's capital, magistrates in robes sit at a table, taking notes and shuffling through files as they listen to testimony from witnesses and advocates. On trial is not a person but the World Bank -- which is to say, global capitalism -- itself. Since Mali, a former French colony, follows French judicial customs, and since the French language is well suited to abstraction, the arguments are not always strictly empirical. Allegations of conspiracy are challenged with demands for proof, but the most eloquent testimony comes in the patient, angry speeches of ordinary Africans who step forward to lament what they see as the cruel consequences of debt servicing and privatization: emigration, loss of control over infrastructure and natural resources, rampant political corruption and a precipitously declining standard of living. Some of the judges are black, some white, and the two teams of lawyers are also mixed, perhaps to suggest that the stakes in the trial cannot simply be reduced to Africa versus the West. Much of the prosecution's oratory may be provocative to Western ears, and may call forth counterarguments. Surely the misrule and war that menace so much of the continent are not solely the fault of foreign powers and institutions. But such provocation seems to be part of Mr. Sissako's project. He wants the discussion of Africa, which has frequently been conducted in terms established in Washington, London, Paris and Brussels, to include African voices, and not only those of the local elite. He also insists -- by means of his visual techniques as much as through the words of his characters -- that the central human facts of the situation cannot be ignored. Like ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' ''Bamako'' can be described as didactic, which simply means that it overtly tries to use film to teach. But there is also another dimension to the movie, an attention to the details of daily life in Bamako that lends it extraordinary richness and gravity. As the lawyers press forward with their eloquence -- occasionally showboating or lapsing into procedural pettifoggery -- the camera wanders through the courtyard and beyond, taking note of the small interactions between men and women, the old and the young, the busy and the idle. People work, read, chat and doze. They listen intently to the trial, which is broadcast over loudspeakers, or else they go about their routines as the speeches play like background music. An oblique, delicate and sad story also threads its way quietly through ''Bamako,'' concerning a singer named Mele (Aissa Maiga); her husband, Chaka (Tiecoura Traore); and their young daughter. While their destinies are linked with the themes under consideration in the trial, these characters are not so much symbols or ciphers as reminders of the almost incomprehensible gulf between the general and the particular. A less confident, more facile director might have tried to force a connection between macroeconomics and a single family's plight, but Mr. Sissako's sensibility is too subtle for such shortcuts. Mele and Chaka are beautiful and dignified; Ms. Maiga's face and carriage make you grateful for the existence of cinema. But they are hardly the noble, suffering Africans of well-intentioned Hollywood caricature. Not that subtlety is everything. Mr. Sissako is trying to make a point, and to use whatever cinematic means he has at hand to bring it home. The most striking of these is a film within the film, a mock-spaghetti western starring Danny Glover and the Palestinian filmmaker Elia Suleiman that turns the prosecution's brief into a bloody allegory. If you saw gunmen killing women and children on the street, or executing schoolteachers because there were too many, you would be appalled and enraged. Those are Mr. Sissako's sentiments exactly, and his ability to channel them into a fierce and unforgettable piece of political art makes ''Bamako'' necessary viewing. BamakoOpens today in Manhattan.

The action, taken in a unanimous vote of the 24 members of the board, was hailed as a step forward by the bank president, Paul D. Wolfowitz, who has made the fight against corruption a signature issue since taking over the institution nearly two years ago. ''I think we now have the framework that will help the bank achieve the main objective of a governance strategy, which is strengthening the ability to help the poor escape poverty,'' Mr. Wolfowitz told reporters after the board meeting. ''The strategy is focused on broad principles to be applied in a consistent manner while remaining flexible to the needs of specific countries.'' Mr. Wolfowitz, a former deputy defense secretary and architect of the Iraq war in President Bush's first term, proposed a new strategy on corruption last year. But he ran into difficulties at the bank, where he was criticized for suspending financing for a number of countries deemed corrupt without consulting the board. Financing was cut off to India, Chad, Kenya, Congo, Ethiopia and Bangladesh, among other countries. Some officials at the bank worried that Mr. Wolfowitz's anticorruption efforts might lead to what they said would be ''disengagement'' by the bank from the world's poorest countries, on grounds that they are poorly governed. Bank officials said that after extensive consultation, the document adopted Tuesday committed the bank to remaining engaged with recipient countries, even when corruption forced the bank to deal with independent groups in the country rather than with the government itself. On the other hand, they said the new strategy continues the bank's policy of not dealing with any group in a country if the leadership of that country objects."28-Mar-07,"CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (92%); AFRICA (92%); CENTRAL AFRICA (79%)","The highway out of town is a single dirt motorcycle track. The colonial-era railroad has finally broken down. The last of the mighty river barges lies rotting on shore with weeds shooting up through its ribs. And so Kindu, a once prosperous city here in Congo's interior, is now so cut off that everything is flown in by plane: bottled water, panes of glass, cookies, cucumbers, even gasoline, at $12 a gallon. This is Congo six months after a historic election, the most expensive in Africa and one that was billed -- by the Congolese and the United Nations officials who paid half a billion dollars for it -- as the end of a free fall. Decades of misrule have reduced the 60 million people of this mineral-rich country to among the poorest in the world. Ceaseless rebellions have destabilized an enormous chunk of central Africa and claimed an estimated four million lives. Congo's fledging government is now trying to stitch the nation back together, as if it ever existed meaningfully at all. But a recent 1,200-mile trip across the country -- by plane, truck, motorbike, hiking boots and dugout canoe -- shows the Congo-size obstacles that are not going away. Kinshasa, the unruly capital at the western edge of the country, looks as if a war has been fought in its streets. There has been some violence there, like the periodic clashes between the presidential guard and a militia loyal to Jean-Pierre Bemba, a tycoon, former warlord and unsuccessful candidate for president. But it is not tanks and bombs that have turned the streets into bone-jarring rubble and many elegant buildings into teetering shells. It is neglect and corruption, which persist despite the election. In early March, when it came time to form the first truly democratic government in the country's history, a political party connected to President Joseph Kabila submitted the name Andre Kasongo Ilunga for trade minister. The problem, government officials later acknowledged, was that there was no such man. Naturally, when the government appointed Mr. Ilunga to the cabinet, he did not show up. The president's advisers soon discovered that the name had been submitted as a ruse to ensure that another politician got the post. ''It was very embarrassing for all of us,'' said Kikaya bin Karubi, a member of Parliament and a confidant of President Kabila. A few days later, Congo's top nuclear official was charged with making an unauthorized deal with a British company to sell the country's copious supply of uranium. That all happened just a few days before Paul D. Wolfowitz, president of the World Bank, arrived in Kinshasa to discuss a $1.4 billion aid program. He said fighting corruption was the ''foundation of all the other things that need to be done in this country,'' but he warned that ''it took many years to bring the country to this point.'' ''It is not going to be fixed overnight,'' Mr. Wolfowitz said. Mr. Kabila has vowed to do his best, and his advisers say he has a stronger hand after defeating Mr. Bemba in a runoff election with 58 percent of the vote. Before that, Mr. Kabila was president of a transitional government in which power was awkwardly divided among him and four vice presidents, two of them warlords. That system was partly to blame for the disappearance of millions of dollars meant for the disarmament of militias. In 2004, Western donors gave Congo more than $200 million to get 330,000 militiamen out of the killing business. The plan was to provide each militia member who voluntarily disarmed with $25 a month and job training. But last summer the money suddenly ran out, after helping only a fraction of the gunmen. ''The money got stolen,'' said Ahmed Shariff, the top official in Kindu for the United Nations, which has 17,000 peacekeeping troops in Congo. ''It was used to build houses and buy cars.'' The government has yet to revive the program, leaving tens of thousands of former militiamen angry, armed and in the bush. Sabuni Bokota is one of them. He is a 5-foot-tall tomato farmer and former militia commander, with three wives and 15 children. They all live in a string of mud brick huts along the east bank of the Congo River in an isolated village called Lotangi, a day's paddle from Kindu past 100-foot-tall stalks of bamboo and baseball-size spiders. During Congo's recent wars, Mr. Sabuni commanded 2,000 militiamen called the Mai-Mai, who greased themselves with palm oil, hung ivory amulets around their necks and chewed antibiotic pills they thought would give them magical powers. The Mai-Mai were a surreal dimension to the chaos that exploded in Congo in the late 1990s after the fall of Mobutu Sese Seko, the longtime dictator of Congo, which he renamed Zaire. Troops from six neighboring countries poured across the borders to plunder minerals. In Lotangi, local people like Mr. Sabuni fought back. The Mai-Mai were supposed to be part of the national disarmament plan, but since they lived in far-off places, many heard about the $25 monthly salaries only over crackly radios and never saw a dime. Now they are getting impatient. Recently, Mr. Sabuni greased himself up again, threw on his amulets and led a contingent of Mai-Mai to Kindu to protest. ''We've been waiting five years,'' he said. ''But they keep telling us it will take time.'' Time has not been especially kind to Lotangi. It used to be part of a network of sun-baked river towns connected by barges, railways and roads built during the Belgian colonial era to cart away as much gold, ivory, produce and timber as possible. The old palm oil plantations and banana warehouses are still there, but they are sinking into the riverbanks, more jungle-eaten evidence of Mobutu's kingdom of rot. ''We used to have electricity,'' said Germain Musombo, 38, who lives here in Kindu, a city of 250,000 lighted by candles. ''We used to have a movie theater. We used to have decent roads and a train that could take us to Lubumbashi in three days,'' a distance of 600 miles. Now that ride takes an entire month. Congo is spread across more than 900,000 square miles, but it has only 300 miles of paved roads. The lack of infrastructure keeps the people poor. Kindu's farmers used to export bananas, wood, rice and peanuts. Now much of their land, among the most fertile in Africa, lies fallow because they cannot get crops to market. ''''There's only so much you can carry on your head,'''' said the acting governor, Katharina Aziza Sadiki. Farther east, the antigovernment frustrations intensify. Kichanga, a little town about 1,000 miles from Kinshasa, lies clearly outside Mr. Kabila's control. It is reachable by a 60-minute United Nations flight from Kindu to Bukavu, a two-hour speedboat ride from Bukavu to Goma and then a three-hour slog up a steep, muddy road. The last government checkpoint is in the market town of Sake. After that, boy soldiers in unmarked uniforms march along the roads with rocket-propelled grenades and knee-high rubber boots. Villagers pay taxes not to the Democratic Republic of Congo but to Laurent Nkunda, the local warlord. Mr. Nkunda is built like a letter opener -- long, sharp and thin. He is a Tutsi nationalist, and with Hutu death squads still roaming the countryside, Mr. Nkunda sees himself as all that stands between Congolese Tutsis and genocide. ''The Tutsis who were killed in Rwanda were my friends,'' he said. ''I cannot accept it here.'' Eastern Congo is probably the most beautiful part of the country, but also the most brutalized and the most confusing. Thousands of lives there have been lost to disease, starvation and a shifting mix of rebel groups. The trouble began in 1994, when Rwanda's Hutu ethnic majority turned on the Tutsi minority and 800,000 people were killed. Ever since, Rwanda's Hutu-Tutsi violence has continued to play out across the border in Congo, where both communities have lived for decades. But something new is happening, which could help bring stability. The Kabila government, empowered by the elections and freed from having to gain the approval of four rival vice presidents for every decision, is striking deals with a number of warlords, including Mr. Nkunda. Sometimes Mr. Kabila has little choice. In November, Mr. Nkunda's forces humiliated government soldiers and advanced to within 10 miles of Goma, one of the biggest cities in eastern Congo. They would have seized it if United Nations peacekeepers had not sent in helicopter gunships. ''Our national army is a joke,'' said Aloys Tegera, the manager of an aid organization in Goma. ''It's a serious problem. Everybody is celebrating this big moment of democratization, but we're building on sand.'' In Kichanga, government troops have been placed in an uneasy chain of command under Mr. Nkunda's officers, but it is hard to know whether warlords like Mr. Nkunda are part of the problem or the solution. The town of Sake was occupied first by Mr. Nkunda's soldiers, who basically left it alone, and then by government troops, who summarily looted it, residents said. Yet Congolese officials continue to accuse Mr. Nkunda of war crimes, including massacring prisoners of war, though many residents here seem to like him, for obvious reasons. ''If you're sick, he gives you money,'' said Sesaga Nzabonimba, a farmer near Sake. Mr. Nkunda said he would rather join the government than strike out on his own. And that may be one of Congo's greatest mysteries -- how after decades of brutal colonial rule, kleptomaniacal dictatorship, ethnic fighting and regional isolation, a faint pulse of nationalism still survives. ''I am a Tutsi, but more than that, I am Congolese,'' Mr. Nkunda said. ''I truly hope that one day I'll be part of the national army. They need the help.''Hundreds Killed in Kinshasa KINSHASA, Congo, March 27 (Reuters) -- More than 200 people were killed last week in fighting between the army and a former rebel leader's forces, European Union ambassadors said Tuesday. Fighting erupted in Kinshasa on Thursday after troops loyal to Mr. Bemba refused an order to disarm. The clashes continued for two days before his forces were routed. ''There are fairly clear indications coming from the hospitals and morgues that are giving the number at between 200 and 600,'' said the German ambassador, Karl-Albrecht Wokalek."6-Apr-07,NORTHERN AFRICA (79%); MIDDLE EAST (79%); AFRICA (79%),"The World Bank rank and file were most upset by our recent column noting that Shaha Riza, linked romantically with bank President Paul Wolfowitz, got some curiously hefty raises upon being detailed to work at the State Department -- but remaining on the bank's payroll. ""Since publication of the . . . column,"" a bank-wide e-mail Wednesday from the bank's staff association said, the association ""has been inundated with messages from staff expressing concern, dismay and outrage."" The association ""has looked into those concerns"" and concluded that, while it couldn't ""determine who drew up and approved"" the agreement detailing Riza to State -- which the bank said was necessary to avoid a conflict of interest -- it did find that the terms are ""grossly out of line with"" bank rules. Riza, a senior communications officer for the Middle East and North Africa region, was promoted to a higher-paying position on Sept. 19, 2005, the day she left for Foggy Bottom, without any of the required open competition for the job, the association said. She also got a pay raise more than double the amount allowed by the rules, the e-mail said, followed by another allegedly overly large raise. Before these bumps up, Riza had been earning $132,660. She's now paid $193,590. (Correction: We said last week that this figure was about $7,000 a year more than what is paid to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, for whom Riza now works. That now appears to be very misleading. Riza's reported pay is net, we're told, and Rice's is gross. So Riza takes home a whole lot more than Rice. We regret the error.) The association said that in general it ""defends a staff member's right to have"" the bank ""preserve the confidentiality of certain information -- and we deplore this leak of a staff member's confidential salary information. However, in this case, the information shared with the press reveals a violation of the staff rules and therefore seems to us a clear case of whistleblowing."" The sharply worded e-mail called on the bank's board and top officials to ""explain how/why the rules were bent in this case"" and noted that ""this is not the first instance of such staff rule violations by the current World Bank Group management."" The association e-mail -- and other bank observers -- questioned how this matter squared with Wolfowitz's anti-corruption drive, which demands that recipients of World Bank loans crack down on graft, nepotism and so on. ""It's ironic that Mr. Wolfowitz lectures developing countries about good governance and fighting corruption, while winking at an irregular promotion and overly generous pay increases to a partner,"" said Bea Edwards, international director of the Government Accountability Project, which first disclosed the pay data. Foreign Policy magazine's editors opined that ""given Wolfowitz's crusade to fight corruption in countries that receive Bank aid, doesn't it seem a little hypocritical to hand your girlfriend inordinate bonuses?"" But these criticisms tend to assign some blame to Wolfowitz, even though his spokesman has assured us that matters involving Riza's ""arrangements"" were made ""at the direction of the bank's board of directors."" And Riza's successor for the Middle East and North Africa region, Karem Elsharkawy, in an e-mail yesterday to his colleagues, implored them to ""maintain a balanced position and be rational and fair."" No wrongdoing has been proven, he said, and until then ""we must give our colleague the benefit of all reasonable doubt."" Market Watch Rep. Mike Pence (R-Ind.), in an op-ed yesterday in USA Today, revised and extended his remarks on how safe he found the Shorja market in Baghdad. ""We milled around for more than an hour,"" he wrote. ""I told reporters afterward that it was just like any open-air market in Indiana in the summertime. I didn't mean that Baghdad was as safe as the Bargersville Flea Market; I just meant that that was what it looked and felt like: lots of people, lots of booths and a friendly relaxed atmosphere."" Well, there are few places on earth as safe as the Bargersville Flea Market. But you know, if you ignored your flak jacket, the scores of heavily armed troops, the military choppers overhead and those armored Humvees circling about, it probably did feel pretty much like most other Indiana markets. Ah, to Be in Brussels . . . Credit the State Department for spectacular timing. Less than a day after GOP mega-fundraiser and Swift Boat donor Sam Fox received a recess appointment to be ambassador to Belgium, BNET, the department's internal television station, was airing a guide to diplomatic living in Brussels. It came complete with suggestions for embassy staff on fine dining, shopping (luxury items, household supplies, food, plants, entertainment, etc.), children's activities and schools in the city. ""Brussels is a very big city with countless parks,"" a narrator says. ""Parks and ponds abound. . . . Belgium is an explorer's paradise."" The video included shots of pristine parks, the insides of delis and supermarkets, video rental stores, bookshops. The half-hour video is titled ""Post Video: A Taste of Brussels."" And of course there's the statue of that kid peeing in the fountain and the absolute best thing about Brussels: Paris is only 1  hour  22 minutes away by train. The next video featured a report on living in Thailand. Sounds Like the Man for the Job The White House has tapped Michael G. Vickers, a former Army Special Forces officer and CIA operations officer, to be assistant secretary of defense for SOLIC (Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict). Vickers, now at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, played a key role in the CIA's army of the Afghan resistance to the Soviets. His background should help him navigate the often bruising bureaucratic tussles in his new job: He was once stabbed in the leg teaching knife fighting and other hand-to-hand combat techniques at West Point."15-Apr-07,AFRICA (99%); UNITED STATES (93%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (92%); MAURITIUS (79%); EUROPE (79%); LIBERIA (79%),"Paul D. Wolfowitz, seeking support for his beleaguered leadership as president of the World Bank, is turning for help to the one group at the bank that aides say he has focused on the most, the leaders of sub-Saharan Africa, bank officials say. At a news conference on Saturday, as hundreds of delegates circulated in Washington and speculated about Mr. Wolfowitz's future, several finance ministers of African countries said he had done an outstanding job in increasing aid to Africa and demanding an end to corruption. ''He has been a visionary,'' said Antoinette Sayeh, finance minister of Liberia, which has received considerable bank assistance following its conflicts of a couple years ago. ''We're very grateful for his leadership in getting where we are today. We look forward to that continuing.'' Rama Sithanen, a deputy prime minister of Mauritius, said Mr. Wolfowitz had been ''supportive of the reforms in our country.'' He said Mr. Wolfowitz ''has apologized for what has happened'' regarding the favoritism shown to his companion, Shaha Ali Riza, who is employed at the bank, and should be dealt with in a way that was ''commensurate'' with his mistakes. Mr. Sithanen and two others at the news conference said, however, that they would accept whatever the bank's 24-member board decided about Mr. Wolfowitz's future and assumed that the bank's pro-Africa policies would continue no matter who is leading the institution. At issue is Mr. Wolfowitz's handling of the transfer, promotion and raise of Ms. Riza at the bank when he arrived in 2005. She was detailed to the State Department and given a raise of nearly 50 percent in a manner that the bank's staff association said violated bank rules. The association has called for him to resign. Late Saturday night, in a new effort to appeal to the staff for understanding, Mr. Wolfowitz sent out e-mail messages to all bank employees calling their attention to documents released Friday. The documents show that he made efforts in 2005 to avoid conflicts of interest at the bank over his relationship with Ms. Riza. The bank's board has been considering the matter but members were more involved this weekend in marathon meetings with delegates from 180 countries than with Mr. Wolfowitz's personal problems. Bank officials critical of Mr. Wolfowitz acknowledge that he has concentrated considerable energy on Africa and received praise from African leaders, but they also accuse him of cynically trying to rally Africans dependent on his good will in recent weeks, as criticism of his leadership has mounted. Several bank officials, asking not to be identified in order to avoid reprisals, charged that Mr. Wolfowitz was seeking backing from Africa as a kind of political base to counter the growing resentment among European leaders over his policies, particularly his anticorruption campaign. The bank's board acts as a kind of legislature setting policies as an equal weight with the president, and in some ways Mr. Wolfowitz's time in office has resembled a tug of war between two branches of government. The board usually decides matters by consensus, but its power centers are the United States, Japan and Europe, the largest donors to its $20 billion annual lending and assistance programs. The board is considering Mr. Wolfowitz's future but getting guidance from more than 180 finance ministries around the world. The comments of top officials here indicated most were willing to wait for the board's judgment, but also seemed to accept Mr. Wolfowitz's apology on Thursday. ''I have total confidence in the institution of the bank to handle this issue,'' said Rodrigo de Rato, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, noting that Mr. Wolfowitz had acknowledged his error. Gordon Brown, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, echoed that view, noting that Mr. Wolfowitz had apologized. ''I think we've got to respect the board's process,'' he said. Mr. Wolfowitz held meetings behind the scenes with these ministers and others in town for the annual session sponsored by the bank and the International Monetary Fund. In a reflection of wariness among Europeans, Germany's minister in charge of the World Bank, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, spoke to Reuters and Bloomberg news services of the importance of preserving the bank's ''moral authority'' and suggested that even though Mr. Wolfowitz has apologized, he might need to leave for the good of the bank. ''He has to decide for himself whether he can continue to fulfill his duties credibly under these circumstances,'' Ms. Wieczorek-Zeul said, according to Bloomberg. These comments reflected a sense among many bank officials that the world's finance ministers would be unlikely to force him out, but that a reprimand of some kind might persuade him that his leadership was untenable. On the other hand, Mr. Wolfowitz has churned through meetings this weekend like a man with a mission. Mr. Wolfowitz met Friday with the African members of the bank's board of governors, an aide said, adding that as bank president he has met virtually every day with at least someone involved in African development. Mr. Wolfowitz was instrumental in pushing for a huge debt cancellation plan for poor countries, most of them in Africa, announced by President Bush, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and other Western leaders at a 2005 summit meeting in Gleneagles, Scotland, attended by the singer Bono and other celebrities. Although he has also imposed temporary aid cutoffs to Africa on grounds of corruption, angering European aid officials who felt they were not consulted, he has also won friends among many African countries for preaching accountability in government. At a meeting on Thursday at which he was booed by bank employees, Mr. Wolfowitz appealed to the hostile crowd to work with him on the bank's real priorities, singling out Africa. A few weeks ago, Mr. Wolfowitz held a ''town hall'' session in the bank's atrium wearing a shirt he had obtained on the most recent of his four trips to Africa as bank president. A slogan on the shirt read, in French, ''No to impunity for violence against women, yes to justice.'' The session was to introduce a new vice president for Africa, Oby Ezekwesili, a former minister in Nigeria, who praised Mr. Wolfowitz and drew applause from the crowd."29-Apr-07,UNITED STATES (92%); AFRICA (92%),"Arriving as president of the World Bank in the summer of 2005, Paul D. Wolfowitz told colleagues that he was eager to tackle poverty in Africa and corruption in aid. But almost immediately he became consumed by frustrating negotiations with bank officials over the status of his companion, an employee at the bank, documents released this month show. Now these documents are at the center of the World Bank's inquiry into his conduct and Mr. Wolfowitz's defense, both of which will be presented at the World Bank's board of directors on Monday. Instead of offering definitive answers on Mr. Wolfowitz's conduct, however, the documents on the handling of the transfer, promotion and salary of Shaha Ali Riza, Mr. Wolfowitz's companion, have become a matter of conflicting interpretations. Mr. Wolfowitz and his lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, are expected to say that the documents back their argument that in handling Ms. Riza's pay raise, promotion and transfer, Mr. Wolfowitz ''acted on the advice of the board's ethics committee to work out an agreement'' fair to her and in compliance with bank rules. But a committee of the bank's board looking into the situation is circulating a document indicating that, after he got authorization to handle the matter, Mr. Wolfowitz appears to have violated bank rules and ethical standards of his own employment contract by granting her an outsize pay raise and a major promotion. On Monday, board members are expected to ask him what criteria he used in granting the salary increase, why he apparently did not clear the specifics with others and why he allowed, or directed, his aides to spread what they say was a falsehood, namely that the ethics committee had approved the salary. Some time in the coming week, the 24-member board may ask for Mr. Wolfowitz's resignation, declare a loss of confidence in his leadership or do nothing in the hope that negotiations with the Bush administration can bring about a voluntary resignation. Few doubt the board's determination to push him out. The documents do show that Mr. Wolfowitz in 2005 alerted bank officials to the potential conflict of interest posed by his relationship with Ms. Riza and that he had sought to recuse himself from discussions about how to resolve it. When an anonymous whistle-blower complained about the salary increase in early 2006, Ad Melkert, the chairman of the bank's ethics committee, said in a letter on Feb. 28 that the complaint did not warrant ''any further review by the committee.'' Mr. Bennett is expected to argue that Mr. Wolfowitz's actions were in accordance with advice by ethics officials and were subsequently cleared by these same officials. This view is endorsed by many who defend Mr. Wolfowitz. ''The initial decision on Ms. Riza's salary was reviewed in 2005 and again in 2006,'' said Ruth Wedgwood, an expert in international law and diplomacy and a longtime acquaintance of Mr. Wolfowitz. ''This is a case of what lawyers call 'asked and answered.' Why is it being brought up now?'' Mr. Melkert declined requests for interviews, but he issued a statement 10 days ago saying that he approved Mr. Wolfowitz's actions in 2005 without knowing about the salary package and that in 2006 he had no authority to reopen it as an ethics matter. ''At no time did Mr. Wolfowitz or anyone else in bank management disclose to the ethics committee the terms and conditions of the external assignment,'' he said. Xavier Coll, a vice president for human resources, was the official directed by Mr. Wolfowitz to give Ms. Riza her pay and promotion. He also declined a request for an interview, but an official close to him said Mr. Coll was uneasy about the raise in 2005 and did not formally approve it even while letting it go through."1-May-07,NIGERIA (96%); AFRICA (94%),"Nuhu Ribadu is the chairman of Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.  FOR the past few weeks, the world has been riveted by the difficulties of Paul Wolfowitz, president of the World Bank, regarding a potential conflict of interest involving the salary of his partner, also a senior official there. With the bank's board deliberating this week over how to handle the charges, the controversy now needlessly and regrettably threatens Mr. Wolfowitz's presidency, which has been largely defined by his energetic support for a new Africa that is struggling to emerge. Over the last two years, Mr. Wolfowitz has effectively directed the bank's energies toward fighting poverty and improving human life. He is a champion of using international development institutions to deal with some of the world's major problems. And he has been a steadfast supporter of the efforts of African organizations to rescue our people from the scourge of misrule, which leads to poverty, disease and early death. Over the last three years, Nigeria, once the emblem of outlandish corruption, has become a leading reformer, and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, which I head, has been at the cutting edge of these efforts. The enormous challenges we face would have proved almost insurmountable without external help, especially from the World Bank under Mr. Wolfowitz. When disgruntled lawmakers here tried to cut off our financing and shut down critical aspects of our operation, a World Bank grant of $5 million allowed us to bring to closure important cases of political corruption involving key members of Nigeria's ruling elite, including members of the executive branch and Parliament. Today our work receives accolades from all corners of the globe, and the financial and moral support of our thoughtful and courageous allies has played a crucial role in our success. In a country that never saw a single conviction for fraud or corruption before the beginning of our reform campaign, we now have 150 convictions, with 400 more cases awaiting decision in the courts. We have also recovered $5 billion in stolen property. We have brought powerful politicians and businessmen to account through the criminal justice system. These developments are gradually improving the integrity of our national life. Two weeks ago, Nigeria had its first general election intended to pass power from one elected government to another. While the election did not meet the high standards we set for ourselves, it did reveal that for citizens, the fight against corruption was a top priority -- right up there with food, health care and education. In other words, Nigerians made the same connection between runaway corruption and human suffering that Mr. Wolfowitz rightly does. Corruption is the greatest challenge to progress across much of the developing world, and as we in Nigeria know from bitter experience, this is particularly so in Africa. As Mr. Wolfowitz remarked in a recent speech, some two million Africans die from AIDS-related illnesses each year, while nearly 3,000 African children die each day from malaria and nearly 40 million are not in school. All this, he noted, despite $300 billion in international aid to Africa over the last 20 years. Corruption has not only produced injustice and a chronic failure to effectively manage international support, it has also led to the squandering of Africa's considerable human and natural resources. Nigeria has made nearly half a trillion dollars from oil in less than five decades -- a figure that dwarfs that of international aid to the whole of Africa. And yet, around 70 percent of Nigerians live in conditions of dispiriting poverty, on incomes of less than a dollar a day. Corruption kills far more effectively than AIDS, malaria or war. On my recent visit to the World Bank in Washington, I was greatly impressed with the remarkable changes in policy and direction that Mr. Wolfowitz had undertaken, as well as by the diversity of talents he had convened to execute his vision of a fairer world. The bank's secretary and two vice presidents are Africans -- one was my colleague in the Nigerian cabinet. Another vice president is Salvadoran. Mr. Wolfowitz spoke eloquently for those of us in poor countries last month when he exhorted citizens of the industrial world: ''As we go back to our comfortable beds tonight, we should think about the voiceless millions who may not even have beds at all, who go to sleep hungry, sick and uncertain about their future. For many it's literally a matter of life and death.'' And he has matched words with deeds through initiatives to promote greater international cooperation with poor countries, especially regarding the recovery of assets from pilfered resources. Effective efforts at fighting corruption cannot stop at our borders when up to 80 percent of the ''grand corruption'' perpetrated in Africa is dependent on international mechanisms that facilitate money laundering. Mr. Wolfowitz has made a praiseworthy effort to halt the illicit drain of money from the coffers of poor countries. Just this simple step -- denying a haven for money stolen from a poor country -- addresses more than half the problem of corruption in Africa. It would be a terrible shame to bring all these efforts to a premature halt. Mr. Wolfowitz has openly acknowledged responsibility for the mistake he made. He has apologized and expressed willingness to accept the decision of the bank's board of directors. But the board should consider how important his error really was, especially considering that the bank's internal documents suggest that Mr. Wolfowitz tried to follow the rules from the beginning. The board should avoid lending credence to the widespread suspicion that Mr. Wolfowitz is really being punished for his previous role in the United States Department of Defense. And it should consider the benefit Mr. Wolfowitz has brought to countries like Nigeria."20-May-07,AFRICA (94%); CHINA (79%); ICELAND (79%); SLOVAKIA (74%),"A new book on globalization starts with a long first chapter that might be called ""Out of Africa."" It's Nayan Chanda's contention in Bound Together: How Traders, Preachers, Adventurers, and Warriors Shaped Globalization (Yale Univ., $27.50) that international trade is really an attempt to recapture the original human condition -- the way we were in Africa before humans fanned out to begin the process of populating the planet somewhere between 50,000 and 70,00 years ago. In effect, Chanda is rephrasing E.M. Forster's ""only connect"" as ""only reconnect."" Chanda emphasizes human demographics to buttress his view that interconnectedness is a basic human drive -- essentially the same impulse that ""has led men and women to . . . try to convert fellow human beings to their faith . . . [and] generations of rulers to invade distant lands and bring larger populations under one umbrella of empire."" It cannot be stopped and it's not a cause for alarm, provided that we remedy the ""shortage of institutional capacity to address"" the challenges that globalization raises. In Connected: 24 Hours in the Global Economy (Farrar Straus Giroux, $24), Daniel Altman takes a more up-to-the-minute approach, trotting the globe to find out how globalization works now. Fastening upon June 15, 2005, , he investigates such topics as emissions brokerage in Slovakia, the difficulties of operating in China (rated by the World Bank in 2006 as ""91st out of 155 countries for the ease of doing business,"" and relative levels of corruption around the world (least corrupt: Iceland; most corrupt: a tie between Chad and Bangladesh). If your image of globalization features Third World sweatshop workers toiling over goods ultimately purveyed in glossy American mail-order catalogues, Sasha Issenberg's The Sushi Economy: Globalization and the Making of a Modern Delicacy (Gotham, $26) says, in effect, ""Not necessarily."" Sushi, Issenberg argues, ""reveals . . . that a virtuous global commerce and food culture can exist. On a new landscape of consumption, power is decentralized, and supply and demand are regulated not by moguls but by local ideas about value and taste. Even large corporations that become involved, particularly the massive Japanese food conglomerates that supply supermarkets and restaurant chains with fresh fish, are usually forced to defer to local expertise.""

""I certainly want to leave no stone unturned in showing people that I'm serious in reaching out to hear their perspectives and views,"" Zoellick said during a telephone news conference. In recent days, Zoellick has met with most of bank's 24-member executive board, which is expected to vote before the end of June to approve him. Wolfowitz, whose resignation takes effect June 30, has already relinquished day-to-day management of the bank. By tradition, the bank's president is an American named by the president. Though some governments have called for an end to the arrangement, with future bank leaders selected on professional merit and without regard to nationality, Zoellick's approval is essentially assured: Most foreign governments have publicly endorsed his nomination, noting his r?sum? as a former U.S. trade representative and deputy secretary of state. Most recently, Zoellick was a vice chairman at Goldman Sachs. Zoellick has said repeatedly that the controversy at the bank in recent months has been traumatic for the staff, potentially leaving a residue of ill will.

In selecting an African nation as his first port of call, Zoellick signaled continuity with Wolfowitz in one regard: Home to hundreds of millions of desperately poor people, Africa is to remain at the center of the bank's focus. Zoellick said he also planned to continue Wolfowitz's campaign to stem corruption in bank lending, which some officials have argued has been a distraction from the bank's core mission of eradicating poverty. ""It's an issue within the larger development agenda,"" Zoellick said. After his stop in Ghana, the current holder of the African Union's revolving presidency, Zoellick is to visit Ethiopia and South Africa. He then planned to travel to Britain, France, Germany and Norway. Finally, visits are planned to Mexico and Brazil before returning to the United States. Though he said it was too early to identify areas in which he would pursue new policies, Zoellick said he planned to examine the bank's lending to ""middle income"" nations such as China, with an economy that has grown so large that it is a distributor of aid across much of Africa. Neither China nor India, another swiftly growing country, is on Zoellick's itinerary this trip. ""I can't be cloned,"" he joked, suggesting that the trip is already packed. Zoellick said he was recently in Asia and the Middle East and that he plans to consult with officials in those regions by phone."21-Jun-07,EUROPE (94%); UNITED STATES (93%); LATIN AMERICA (79%); FRANCE (79%); IRAQ (79%); AFRICA (79%); GERMANY (77%),"Robert B. Zoellick, President Bush's nominee for president of the World Bank, secured the support of the bank's board of directors on Wednesday after reporting to them about his recent meetings with bank representatives around the world, bank officials said. Mr. Zoellick, 53,  a top executive at Goldman Sachs and a former senior trade envoy and deputy secretary of state, met with the bank's 24-member board the day after he returned from meetings to reassure bank officials in Africa, Europe and Latin America about his plans for the institution. The board is expected to formalize its support for Mr. Zoellick on Monday. Bank officials said that Mr. Zoellick outlined his views of the bank's opportunities and difficulties and told members that he would strive to stabilize the bank after the stormy two-year tenure of Paul D. Wolfowitz, who resigned in May amid accusations of favoritism to his companion, a bank employee. ''The board found Zoellick to be somebody who understands the issues and the needs of the bank,'' said a senior bank official  who had been briefed on the meeting. ''It was a very positive meeting from the board's point of view.'' By tradition, whoever is nominated by the United States for the bank presidency is elected to the job, but Mr. Bush's choice of Mr. Wolfowitz, a former deputy defense secretary, rankled donor nations in 2005. Mr. Wolfowitz was approved after Gerhard Schroder, then chancellor of Germany, and Jacques Chirac, then president of France, decided not to reopen trans-Atlantic wounds from the onset of the Iraq war two years earlier by opposing the appointment. Many European officials said then that they would try to change the rules for Mr. Wolfowitz's successor. Some European officials said they still wanted to question the tradition of the president of the United States appointing the president of the bank. Several said  the bank should consider candidates besides Mr. Zoellick. In the end, however, no other candidates emerged, and bank officials said Mr. Zoellick had succeeded in assuaging fears in Europe and elsewhere that someone appointed by Mr. Bush would try to impose an administration-backed agenda on bank decisions. A bank official familiar with Mr. Zoellick's meeting said he was very precise in discussing possible changes in the bank's governing structure and its difficulties on issues like whether to continue lending to so-called middle-income countries that have easy access to capital markets, the need to raise money for the poorest countries and combating corruption in bank lending. ''Intellectually and professionally it was a very good performance,'' said a bank official familiar with the meeting. Mr. Wolfowitz's resignation will become effective on June 30, and officials said they did not expect Mr. Zoellick to take office until afterward. In the last 10 days, he visited Ghana, Ethiopia, South Africa, Britain, France, Belgium, Germany, Norway, Mexico and Brazil. Mr. Zoellick declined to comment on his meetings at the bank. He was the choice of a search led by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., who told the House Committee on Financial Services on Wednesday that Mr. Zoellick would ''rightly keep Africa at the center of the bank's focus and continue the vital campaign to fight corruption and reduce poverty.''"26-Jun-07,LESOTHO (93%); BRAZIL (92%); UNITED STATES (92%); AFRICA (92%); SOUTHERN AFRICA (88%),"For years, rumors of corruption surrounded an ambitious World Bank project for a system of reservoirs and water tunnels in the mountains of Lesotho in southern Africa. In 2002, the project director was convicted of graft and sent to jail. But it took the bank another four years to bar two engineering companies that were convicted on bribery charges from getting future contracts, during which time they collected $14 million in fees from the bank. Combating corruption was a signature issue for Paul D. Wolfowitz in his two stormy years as bank president. Last year, he hailed the belated blacklisting of the companies on the Lesotho project as helping to ensure ''that precious public resources go to help the poor, for whom they are intended.'' But the corruption issue was also a source of anger at the bank that contributed to Mr. Wolfowitz's forced resignation last month amid charges of favoritism toward his girlfriend, who had worked for the bank. Some bank officials fear, and others hope, that with his departure the issue will fade. All indications are, however, that his successor, Robert B. Zoellick, will not let that happen. ''Corruption is a cancer that steals from the poor, eats away at governance and moral fiber and destroys trust,'' Mr. Zoellick said.  ''The challenge is how best to clean corruption out. That's what the World Bank must diagnose, determine and execute in concert with developing and developed countries.'' [On Monday, Mr. Zoellick, 53, was elected president of the World Bank and will formally take over on Sunday.] As chief of the bank, which is charged with helping poor nations develop their economies and improve social conditions, Mr. Zoellick will face the challenge of repairing shattered relationships within the institution and between management and the board, which represents the countries that contribute to its operations. He will also need to raise about $30 billion from those countries to rebuild the bank's program of providing interest-free loans to the world's poorest countries. Mr. Zoellick has vowed in private meetings to press an anticorruption agenda but also to avoid Mr. Wolfowitz's mistakes, like cutting off money and punishing poor people dependent on bank programs in countries that happen to be poorly governed, bank officials said. Mr. Zoellick, a former top trade envoy and deputy secretary of state under President Bush, said he believed that much of the controversy under Mr. Wolfowitz  swirled around the perception that he cared more about corruption than about fighting poverty. In addition, Suzanne Rich Folsom, who was appointed by Mr. Wolfowitz to run the office of institutional integrity, has drawn fire for her management style. Under Ms. Folsom's leadership, the department received a 50 percent increase in funding and an expanded mandate to investigate corruption cases. Defenders of Ms. Folsom said that it was inevitable that she would be unpopular, while critics said she had trampled on employee rights and had been selective in her inquiries. ''There are definitely tensions in the system,'' Mr. Zoellick said in an interview. ''What I've found is a high degree of distrust over the real purpose of the anticorruption campaign. Our challenge now is to find real guidelines that can restore everyone's trust and assure governments that the bank is not wasting money.'' How much corruption exists is a matter of conjecture. A former top official, requesting anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject, estimated that it might affect as many as 40 percent of bank projects, at least in small ways. Others said the money lost to graft might not be more than a small share of the bank's lending. No one disputes that in its 60-year existence, the bank did not do much about corruption until a decade ago, when  James D. Wolfensohn, who was then the bank president, made combating it a priority. The department of institutional integrity was established only seven years ago. It has barred 148 individuals and 190 companies from doing business with the bank. In an institution that employs 10,000 workers, 74 employees have been cited for cases of fraud and corruption. In recent years, the bank has gone beyond specific cases and started investigations into pervasive corruption problems in Vietnam, Indonesia, Kenya, Cambodia and India. In India, for example, the investigation persuaded Mr. Wolfowitz to slow three projects worth nearly $700 million that combated tuberculosis and provided maternal and child health care. The inquiry found bid-rigging in procurement of pharmaceuticals that appeared to have been condoned, or to have involved, top government officials. But when Mr. Wolfowitz suspended funding for these programs, some officials in the bank and at the British development office, which was a  co-sponsor of the health projects, protested that innocent sick people would suffer. They forced a rewriting of the rules curbing the ability of the bank president to suspend funding unilaterally. Mr. Wolfowitz also angered colleagues at the World Bank when he suspended funding for Uzbekistan over allegations of human rights abuses. Some officials said  that he was influenced by Uzbekistan's decision to bar American warplanes from its airspace. In Vietnam, the bank's integrity division decided to investigate pervasive corruption problems after a scandal last year involving charges of theft, bribery and nepotism in a road-building project. Vietnamese prosecutors charged that road-building money lined the pockets of officials and also went to pay for gambling and prostitutes. The institutional integrity reviews, however grounded in realities, have left a legacy of tension between the anticorruption investigators and the rest of the bank. Many officials at the bank said that some of their colleagues believed that minor graft was a small price to pay to speed vitally needed programs for the poor. ''Relations between the bank staff and the department have really soured in the last two years,'' said a former top official of the institutional integrity unit. ''There is a lot of pushback from everyone at the bank, because of the us-against-them attitude created by Wolfowitz.'' Christopher B. Burnham, a former United Nations under secretary general for management, said that Mr. Zoellick must figure out how to enlist suspicious bank officials in his agenda. ''International bodies operate by consensus,'' Mr. Burnham said. ''He has to bring everybody along with him.'' Mr. Zoellick has not signaled his intentions about Ms. Folsom's office, according to bank officials, other than to say that he has learned of the distrust between her and others. For example, the bank's staff association, which represents the bulk of its employees, has accused her office of trampling on the rights of employees and investigating some unfairly. In addition, the bank's 24-member board has raised concerns about what directors say is a backlog of uncompleted investigations and a decline in the number of cases closed. In an interview, Ms. Folsom said that in the last two years the department had moved to ''a new level of processing cases,'' overhauling its procedures, including a program for companies and individuals to disclose graft voluntarily to avoid even harsher sanctions. Still, she said, ''this department has been unpopular since its creation seven years ago.'' ''This type of department is always going to be unpopular. There are going to be some people who just don't want to be bothered.'' Ms. Folsom's defenders include Mr. Wolfensohn, the former bank president, who enlisted her as an adviser long before Mr. Wolfowitz put her in charge of the integrity unit. In an interview, Mr. Wolfensohn praised Ms. Folsom as an ''extraordinarily competent'' official who had been ''unnecessarily damaged'' by the controversy surrounding Mr. Wolfowitz. ''The fact is, there is corruption in all international aid activities,'' Mr. Wolfensohn said. ''It's not a surprise that in some countries, it becomes excessive and you shouldn't do business with them.'' The furor over Ms. Folsom, and Mr. Wolfowitz's actions following her findings, led last year to the establishment of an outside review of the anticorruption efforts by a group headed by Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman. The review is to be completed by September, prompting speculation at the bank that it might lead to Ms. Folsom's departure. But Mr. Volcker said in an interview that he did not expect the review to single out individual performances. ''We'll be drawing some conclusions, but we're not going to point fingers at particular individuals,'' Mr. Volcker said in an interview. Mr. Wolfensohn said that he had conferred at length with Mr. Zoellick and that he believed the new president seemed to be going about the issue in the right way. ''He is already reaching out,'' Mr. Wolfensohn said. ''He understands that you have to return the bank to its main thrust, which is development on behalf of the poor. ''As one of the elements, you want to combat corruption,'' Mr. Wolfensohn added. ''But you can't make the bank into the attorney general of the world.''"12-Jul-07,NIGERIA (92%); ZAMBIA (79%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%),"Tyler Cowen is professor of economics at George Mason University and author of the forthcoming ''Discover Your Inner Economist: Use Incentives to Fall in Love, Survive Your Next Meeting, and Motivate Your Dentist.''  It is unfortunate that economists have to debate whether natural resources are a blessing or a curse for a developing nation. Minerals, diamonds or oil may appear to represent automatic wealth but resource-rich countries usually become mired in corruption. High oil revenues, for instance, allow a government to maintain power and reward political supporters without doing much for its people. The government of Nigeria has taken in billions from high oil prices, yet the average person was probably better off 40 years ago. The easy-to-reach wealth of a resource also encourages coups, and thus political stability is problematic. The solution is to make these governments more accountable in spending their money, but how can that be done? Paul Collier, an economics professor at Oxford University, has a new and potentially powerful idea. In his recently published book, ''The Bottom Billion: Why the Poorest Countries Are Failing and What Can Be Done About It'' (Oxford University Press), Professor Collier favors an international charter -- some widely publicized guidelines that countries can voluntarily adopt -- to give transparency in spending wealth from natural resources. A country would pledge to have formal audits of its revenues and their disposition. Imagine PricewaterhouseCoopers auditing the copper revenues of Zambia and issuing a public report. Professor Collier's proposal at first glance seems toothless; a truly corrupt country probably wouldn't follow the provisions of the charter, which, after all, is voluntary. Yet citizens could pressure their government to follow such a charter, and the idea of the charter would create a focus for political opposition and signify international support for concrete reform. Foreign corporations would bring further pressures to heed the charter. Multinational companies that are active in corrupt countries might receive bad domestic publicity. Eventually the companies might push for adherence to the charter, even if the charter limited their ability to bribe. In another context, De Beers has been stung by bad publicity about ''blood diamonds,'' and the company is now a force for positive change where it operates. In the optimistic case, a few poor countries start abiding by the charter. Those countries prosper and attract more investment and status in the international community. The pressure to adopt the charter would then spread. Of course, promoting the charter costs relatively little and the potential benefits are significant. International pressures did eventually force a change in South African apartheid. So maybe they can improve other countries as well. Revenue audits would limit politicians' ability to rake off funds for personal use or take bribes to give foreign companies a sweetheart deal. As it stands now, citizens of poor countries usually have no idea how much natural resource wealth is being generated or where that money is going. Accounting for natural resource revenues would also help poor countries plan for the future. Many poor exporting nations ride their fortunes up and down with the price of oil or other resources. Ideally, these countries should be setting funds aside when the price of their resource is high. But, of course, no one will save money that will be stolen by others. Secure and audited funds can enable better planning for hard economic times. The British government has already made one start toward a natural resources charter with its Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, begun in 2002. The World Bank has supported this idea and we need only imagine further waves of publicity, more active involvement from the International Monetary Fund and stronger interest from aid organizations and other nongovernmental organizations. Even more promising is that Nigeria, one of the most corrupt countries, enacted a revenue transparency provision into law, as of May 28. The new Nigerian law relies too heavily on the federal government to monitor revenues, thereby reminding us of the old adage about the fox and the henhouse. Nonetheless, state governors opposed the measure strongly, which is a sign it may prove to have teeth. Furthermore, Nigeria did allow an audit by a private company in 2006, and it allowed the significant discrepancies to be publicized. The country may or may not turn the corner, but there are pressures building for greater rule of law. In general, transparency can improve governance. A World Bank working paper written in 1999 by Christos Kostopoulos, ''Progress in Public Expenditure Management in Africa,'' found that many African countries improved their management of public spending in the 1990s. Openness can, in fact, break the links among corruption, secrecy and lack of accountability. Professor Collier notes that in Uganda only 20 percent of the money from one educational program actually reached the schools. One Ugandan bureaucrat publicized the allocations to both the news media and to the schools, and eventually 90 percent of the money flowed to the schools. Simply sending more foreign aid backfires when leaders are corrupt and governance is bad. And Western governments are not willing to send enough aid to make a big difference. Revenue transparency is not an immediate fix, but it would increase the productivity of both Western aid and Western trade. Workable development ideas are hard to find, but Professor Collier may have identified the next frontier for positive change."13-Aug-07,CHAD (99%); AFRICA (98%); CHINA (96%); COTE D'IVOIRE (92%); FRANCE (90%); ANGOLA (79%); GUINEA (79%); NIGERIA (79%),"The small plane flew in low over a scorched, peppercorn scrubland, following a broad, muddy river that was all elbows on its run to the southeast. The first hint of humanity came with the appearance of an immense grid for seismic testing, laboriously traced through the brush. Finally, a lonely, hulking steel drilling platform popped into view. Chad is as geographically isolated as places come in Africa. It is also among the continent's poorest and least stable countries, the scene of recurrent civil wars and foreign invasions since it gained independence from France in 1960. None of that has put off the Chinese, though. In January, they bought the rights to a vast  exploration zone that surrounds this rural village, making the  baked wilderness here, without roads, electricity or telephones,  the latest frontier for their thirsty oil industry and increasingly global ambitions. The same is happening in one African country after another. In large oil-exporting countries like Angola and Nigeria, China is building or fixing railroads, and landing giant exploration contracts in Congo and Guinea. In mineral-rich countries that had been all but abandoned by foreign investors because of unrest and corruption, Chinese companies are reviving output of cobalt and bauxite. China has even become the new mover and shaker in agricultural countries like Ivory Coast, once the crown jewel in France's postcolonial African empire, where Chinese companies are building a new capital, in Yamoussoukro, paid for by Chinese loans. Surging Chinese interest in this continent has helped bring about what many Africans believe is the most important moment since the end of the cold war, when democracy was spreading in Africa and Western nations spoke of a ''peace dividend'' that might ease African poverty. That blush of interest in Africa quickly faded, though, as did several of the new democracies, and Africans and Westerners have regarded each other warily ever since. Westerners complain about chronic corruption and ineffective government, while Africans lament broken promises on aid and a hostile international economic system. The Chinese have stepped into this picture, coming to struggling countries  like Chad with deep pockets, fewer demands on how African governments should behave and an avowed faith in everyone's ability to prosper. As Beijing's ambassador to this country, Wang Yingwu, said at his residence in Ndjamena, Chad's capital, where the electricity repeatedly failed, ''We are exempting Chadian goods from import duties.'' When the interviewer noted that Chad produced almost nothing besides oil, Mr. Wang was undaunted, saying, ''If they don't produce things today, they will tomorrow.'' To help make that happen, China plans to build the country's first oil refinery, lay new roads, provide irrigation and erect a mobile telephone network, for starters. With such intensive efforts across the continent, China's trade with Africa topped $55 billion in 2006, up from less than $10 million in the 1980s. To achieve this growth, it has bypassed multinational institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and flouted many of their lending criteria, including minimum standards of transparency, open bidding for contracts, environmental impact studies and assessments of overall debt and fiscal policies. In some ways, the new Chinese model of doing business in Africa is a throwback to an earlier era of Western involvement that is now widely seen as disastrous. In that era, borrowing countries typically had to work with companies from the lending nation, limiting competition and giving priority to business over development. Today, China takes things even further, signing long-term deals for rights to natural resources that allow countries otherwise unworthy of credit to repay their debt in oil or mineral output. ''In what manner has Africa progressed, in what sector?'' said the Chadian president, Idriss Deby, referring to decades of close ties to the West. ''Whatever the good will of Africa's old friends and the old partners in its development, it has not progressed at all.'' Still, major doubts hang heavily in the air. Will China's hunger for raw materials enable this continent to take off? Or will Beijing's willingness to spend  whatever it needs in Africa, without regard to fiscal prudence, democracy, honest business practices  and human rights, produce a replay of booms past, enriching local elites but leaving the continent poorer, its environment despoiled and its natural resources depleted? A Test Case for China There are few better places than Chad to watch for signs of how China's African gambit will pay off. Chad ranks just four places from the bottom on the United Nations scale of human development, yet it is emerging as a critical piece in China's economic push in a broad swath of sub-Saharan Africa, beginning with Sudan and extending in virtually every direction. Despite  advanced prospecting by French and other Western firms dating back to the 1970s, Chad's oil had never been tapped. The nation was simply too unstable and the price of oil too low to justify investing much here. The oil that had been found was of low quality, and there was no practical way to get it out. That changed in 2000, when the World Bank agreed to help finance a $4.2 billion, 665-mile pipeline connecting Chad to Cameroon on the condition that oil revenues be used to fight poverty. Chad's revenues quickly outstripped expectations, but have not gone into quelling its immense poverty. Mismanagement and fraud have beset the World Bank plan from the start. Beyond that, Chadian rebels with bases in Sudan have been trying  to depose Mr. Deby, so he pressed the World Bank to relax its rules on how to spend the country's oil money. A compromise  was reached, and he went on a military spending spree, buying guns, aircraft and armored vehicles for his troops, along with a fleet of armored Humvees that stop  traffic as they zoom about Ndjamena's dusty, potholed streets. Seeking an even freer hand with the country's oil bonanza, Mr. Deby's government also  hinted that it could find other partners willing to invest in Chad, especially with the price of oil so high. Then, in 2006, Chad ended a relationship with Taiwan and  recognized mainland China, and the floodgates opened. China bought the rights to several oil exploration zones in the country from a Canadian company and has gone from bit player to center stage in  Chad's affairs, confident that it can wring smart profits from the most inhospitable conditions. ''The Canadians and the Americans are only interested in really big finds,'' said a veteran Western oil production engineer who works under contract here for the China National Petroleum Company,  the  C.N.P.C. ''Anything else they think is not worth their time. The Chinese have a different approach. They are happy with the smaller finds, just lots of them.  ''They seem to have a different time frame, too,'' the engineer added. ''They plan to be here for a while.'' Indeed, the Chinese dream in this region consists of making finds here and there, using the World Bank financed pipeline to transport the oil and eventually building new pipelines to connect with a Chinese-built grid in Sudan. This vision requires not only finding more oil, but establishing peace between Chad and Sudan.  Darfur, the chaotic western Sudanese region where at least 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million been displaced in a government-backed counterinsurgency campaign, lies next to China's  exploration zones.Human rights groups maintain that Chinese weapons have played a major role in the  carnage in Darfur. Beijing's recent diplomatic activity in the region may be explained by these Chinese oil interests as much as by American pressure on China to help stop the killing in Darfur. ''It used to be that when we had problems with our neighbor sending mercenaries to invade us that none of our complaints before the United Nations would pass, because China blocked them,'' said President Deby. Since breaking relations with Taiwan and opening the door to Chinese investment, he added, ''we have been able to raise our concerns without taboo.'' One topic that neither side was willing to say much about was the World Bank's foundering efforts to ensure that petroleum revenues were well spent here.  ''I know the current pipeline is part of a project involving the World Bank and Esso,'' said Dou Lirong, the general manager of C.N.P.C. International in Chad, calling the authority over revenues ''a very complicated'' matter. ''I don't know too much about it,'' Mr. Dou continued, ''but I've read a little bit on the Web.'' In fact, the very idea of the World Bank project is anathema to China's deeply held noninterference policy, which has for decades governed China's foreign policy and development. Underlying both is a kind of golden rule -- China considers other countries meddling in its affairs unacceptable, and it assumes its friends feel the same way. Cao Zhongming, deputy director of the Department of African Affairs, in the Chinese Foreign Ministry said: ''China won't interfere with Chad's internal affairs. As a policy, that doesn't change. If C.N.P.C., World Bank and Chad reach an agreement, it's between them.'' But, he added, if Chad does not accept the World Bank arrangement, ''neither C.N.P.C. or the Chinese government would impose it.'' ''The Chinese government,'' he said, ''won't enforce something that Chad thinks interferes with their internal affairs.'' To China's new African allies, this notion is a breath of fresh air. After years of hewing to the latest fads in international development doled out by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, Western donors and the United Nations, African governments have grown weary of the strings attached to foreign aid. Therese Mekombe, vice chairwoman of the committee that monitors Chad's oil money to make sure it is used properly, expressed surprise about the Chinese executive's uncertainty about how oil revenues would be handled. Brandishing a copy of the law, she said all of the country's oil earnings fell under the control of the World Bank arrangement. ''The Chinese need to understand that they cannot arrive in a country and just impose their way of thinking,'' Ms. Mekombe said. A 'Win-Win' Business Plan Chinese officials almost invariably describe their relationship with African countries as a win-win -- based on mutual respect, aimed at joint prosperity and free of the overtones of exploitation and paternalism that critics worldwide say have governed much of the West's postcolonial relationship with Africa. China plans to build a petroleum refinery and a cement factory in Chad, both desperately needed in a landlocked country forced to import basic goods. Indeed, lowering gas and cement prices, which are among the highest in Africa, could do more to reduce poverty than the efforts of the World Bank and other donors combined, Mr.  Dou suggested.  ''We can make a contribution to Chad,'' he  said. Asked for an example of what  win-win relationships look like, Mr. Dou offered what might seem an unlikely choice: Sudan. In its capital, Khartoum, he said, signs of China's impact are everywhere. ''If you go to Sudan, you see paved roads,'' he said. In the past, ''the cars in Sudan had no turn signals, they point directions by hand. Now there are many good cars.'' Asked whether the oil money was really benefiting the Sudanese people, not just their rulers, Mr.  Dou replied: ''It is difficult for me to say. I am an engineer.'' To some critics, the answer is clear. ''China's no-strings-attached approach is problematic, particularly if its effect, if not its intent, is to undermine others' efforts to change situations on the ground,'' said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. ''Often what is happening,'' he added, ''is underwriting of repression.'' Few Benefits for the People Even with binding arrangements governing the use of oil revenues, Chad's people have largely missed out. In the Mayo-Kebbi  region, where much of China's feverish oil exploration is happening, the city of Bongor hardly looks like the capital of the booming oil region it is set to become. Along its tree-fringed main avenue, the briskest business is  preparing  the city's signature dish -- a chicken so scrawny it can be grilled whole in a few minutes. At the lone hospital, a moldering colonial-era structure, a handful of workers tended to dozens of patients suffering from the classic ailments of poverty: hunger, diarrhea, malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS, pneumonia. Civil servants were on strike, seeking to force the government, which according to World Bank estimates will collect $1.2 billion in oil money this year, to increase their meager salaries. Pauline Maratangou, a 53-year-old midwife, did show up to work, and it was a good thing. Half a dozen pregnant women with bellies fit to burst patiently awaited her services. ''Vas-y, vas-y, vas-y!'' she cooed, urging an 18-year-old mother to push. The maternity ward had only a padded bench for deliveries and no stirrups. The floors and walls were caked with dirt -- the orderlies were on strike. Ms. Maratangou worked with quick, efficient motions, pouring iodine over the crown of the baby's head as it emerged, trying to keep mother and child free of infection. At last a little boy popped out, his head slightly misshapen, like a peanut shell. ''Ah, he's a handsome boy,'' she said, holding him aloft, feet first, waiting for his first bellowing cries. There was only time to snip his umbilical cord, weigh him -- five and a half  pounds, not too bad for this part of the world -- and swaddle him in rags before the next mother, also 18, was ready to hop on the table still slick with afterbirth slime. The grim conditions help explain why Chad has among the highest maternal and infant mortality rates in the world. One of every five children will die before age 5. ''We hear that our country has oil, but we see no evidence of it here,'' said Ms. Maratangou, the midwife. Officials in Bongor say money from Chinese investments could fix schools and hospitals, or provide jobs and new roads. Under Chadian law, 5 percent of the oil revenue is supposed to go back to the community where the oil was drilled. ''We have very high hopes,'' said Khalifa Malloum, the secretary general of Bongor's regional government. ''If the West does not want to invest in us, let the Chinese come. We welcome them. They don't tell us what to do and they bring development. They are good partners.'' But Limassou Saleh, a community organizer in Bongor, said he was deeply skeptical.   ''Chad is maybe the most corrupt country in the world,'' Mr. Saleh said. ''We have a long history of human rights violations, of lack of transparency, of exploitation. China has a reputation for corruption. They are one of the worst human rights abusers. They have no record of transparency. What would we want with a country like that? Only to make our own problems worse.''"18-Sep-07,NIGERIA (92%); SWITZERLAND (79%); AFRICA (79%),"The World Bank and the United Nations announced Monday that they were setting up a system to help developing nations recover assets stolen and sent abroad by corrupt leaders that amount to an estimated $40 billion a year. ''There should be no safe haven for those who steal from the poor,'' Robert B. Zoellick, the bank's president, said in presenting the plan with Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Mr. Zoellick estimated that the overall cross-border flow of global proceeds from criminal activities, corruption and tax evasion was $1 trillion to $1.6 trillion annually, and said that even a small portion of that could provide financing for much-needed social programs. He said that every $100 million recovered could pay for immunizations for four million children, or provide water connections for 250,000 households, or finance treatment for a year for more than 600,000 people with H.I.V. and AIDS. The problem of stolen assets is  most acute in Africa, where an estimated 25 percent of the gross national product of states is lost to corruption, he said. The new system will work to build the capacity of developing countries to track stolen money going overseas and to emphasize ways that financial centers can better detect and deter money laundering. ''This is not just a developing-country issue because the funds inevitably end up in developed countries,'' said Danny Leipziger, the bank's vice president for poverty reduction and economic management. The bank intends to assist countries in devoting recovered money to proper development use ''to make sure it is not stolen twice,'' Mr. Leipziger said. The program is being developed in partnership with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, whose executive director, Antonio Maria Costa, said the initiative came at a time when the sophistication of financial transactions made recovery an increasingly complex process requiring expert assistance. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the former finance minister of Nigeria, who oversaw the return of $505 million to her country from Switzerland, said the new plan would help countries like hers by denying corrupt officials a foreign place to hide the money. ''It means that people who are corrupt will know that any money sent out will be sent back to the countries from which they came,'' she said. Ms. Okonjo-Iweala said that at the time that she was working to repatriate Nigerian money in 2005, the campaign had to be conducted with no international backing and did not produce timely results. ''There are some countries -- I don't want to name them -- whose legislation only allows them to freeze the assets if they are discovered, and there is nothing that says they should repatriate them,'' she said. That has changed since the United Nations Convention Against Corruption went into effect in December 2005, obliging countries that ratified it to cooperate. Still, there are 98 countries that have not ratified it, including Canada, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Japan and Switzerland. ''Part of our advocacy role will be to urge countries that are not parties to become parties,'' Ms. Okonjo-Iweala said."18-Sep-07,SAUDI ARABIA (95%); UNITED KINGDOM (94%); EUROPE (94%); PHILIPPINES (92%); UNITED STATES (92%); GERMANY (91%); IRELAND (79%); NIGERIA (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (79%); ENGLAND (76%); CENTRAL EUROPE (57%),"U.N., World Bank to Help With Stolen Assets The United Nations and the World Bank started an initiative to make it easier for governments in developing countries to recover stolen assets stashed in richer countries by corrupt leaders. Stolen Asset Recovery, or StAR, aims to encourage rich countries to return the loot and for developing countries to properly invest the recovered funds. It took the Philippines 18 years to repatriate $624 million of former ruler Ferdinand Marcos's money in a Swiss bank account. Last year, Nigeria ended a five-year battle to recover $500 million parked in a Swiss bank by former dictator Sani Abacha. Management Buys Out Virgin Megastore Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Group, said he agreed to sell the Virgin Megastore music chain in Britain and Ireland to a management buyout team. Terms were not disclosed. During the next month, the 125 stores will be rebranded as Zavvi after Zavvi Entertainment Group, the buyers of the business. The deal is not expected to affect jobs at the chain, which employs about 2,500 people. Over the past six years, Virgin has been offloading its entertainment retailing operations by franchising out its international business, and the British-and-Irish chain was the last wholly owned retail business. Saudi Arabia to Buy British Fighter Jets Saudi Arabia signed an $8.84 billion agreement to buy 72 Eurofighter Typhoon jets from Britain's BAE Systems, the Saudi Press Agency and Britain's Ministry of Defense said. Britain said the deal was part of a new defense cooperation program between the countries called Project Salam, the Arabic word for peace. The agreement also includes opportunities to train Saudi pilots and ground technicians in Britain. In an apparent move to quell concerns over allegations that BAE offered bribes in return for contracts, the Saudi news agency said the price of ""each jet is the same as the price to be sold to the Royal British Air Force."" BAE, Europe's largest defense contractor, has been the subject of investigations in England and the United States into its earlier dealings with Saudi Arabia. Analysts Predict Drop in Investor Confidence Investor confidence in Germany, Europe's largest economy, is expected to hit a nine-month low in September after the U.S. housing slump pushed up borrowing costs and roiled financial markets, a survey of economists shows. The ZEW Center for European Economic Research is likely to report that its index of investor and analyst expectations dropped to minus 17, the lowest since December, from minus 6.9 the previous month, according to the median of 40 forecasts. ZEW is to publish the report today. Defaults on U.S. subprime mortgages have made banks reluctant to lend, jeopardizing economic growth by increasing the cost of credit to companies and consumers. The European Central Bank was forced this month to shelve a planned interest-rate increase.

The news came at the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank this weekend, where leaders of the latter group are trying to raise money to fight poverty on the continent -- and grappling with the difficulty of trying to help some of the world's poorest people, many of whom live in countries with considerably corrupt governance. The fund's projections have African nations growing more slowly than emerging East Asia, but on the right track; its economists expect 6 percent growth in total output forecast this year and nearly 7 percent growth in 2008. Inflation has been contained across most of Africa, excluding Zimbabwe (where there has been hyperinflation recently), according to the fund's annual regional economic outlook, released yesterday. ""African economic policies are far better than in the past,"" Abdoulaye Bio-Tchan, African development director of the IMF, said of the improvement. ""Deficits are going down, inflation is going down, and as I suggested, the growth rate is picking up based on those strong policies."" Robert B. Zoellick, president of the World Bank, is trying to raise nearly $40 billion over the coming months for a fund that will pay for development projects for the world's 81 poorest nations, most of them in Africa. But raising the money is likely to be challenging. Many nations are facing tight budgets and wish to control their aid activities themselves rather than turn money over to the World Bank as an intermediary. Developing countries such as China and India are home to hundreds of millions of very poor individuals, but those countries can handily raise money for development projects through private capital. The countries that don't have access to private capital markets and thus most need help from an organization like the World Bank tend to have unstable or corrupt governments. But donors are wary of funding projects in which big chunks of the money may get siphoned off. Zoellick's predecessor, Paul D. Wolfowitz, made fighting corruption his top priority, and an outside commission chaired by former Federal Reserve chairman Paul A. Volcker recommended an overhaul of the World Bank's fraud-fighting unit in a report last month. Zoellick said last week that  the bank's role must go beyond financing roads, dams and other infrastructure. ""Many people think that our role is just the traditional World Bank of the '60s, of project finance,"" he said. ""Our real role is helping to create the markets, the intermediation, the institutions, so these things go on long beyond us."" There is little that the World Bank can do for regimes that are corrupt at the very top, said Raymond Fisman, a Columbia University economist who studies corruption. ""If the top guy in the country isn't buying into it, there's not much hope,"" he said. ""But if there is genuine interest in reform, the World Bank can play a very good role in figuring out how best to implement anti-corruption reform."" Nigeria offers an example of the challenge. A major oil exporter, the nation has been enriched in recent years by high energy prices. The IMF said yesterday that it expects the Nigerian economy to grow 8 percent next year. But it also has a legacy of being one of the most corrupt nations in the world, under a succession of military leaders. (It now is controlled by civilians). Even if the IMF growth projection is correct, its gross domestic product per person would be only $1,136, and about 35 percent of its population lived in extreme poverty in 2004. Transparency International, a nonprofit organization, ranks Nigeria the 32nd most corrupt nation out of 180, with officials routinely requiring bribes in exchange for routine public services. Speaking to reporters yesterday, Nigerian Finance Minister Shamsuddeen Usman said that the nation has made steady progress eradicating corruption. For example, he said, he and other leaders are now publicly disclosing their assets, a check against bribes and the siphoning of oil wealth. ""I think the issue of corruption is becoming less and less,"" Usman said. Then, slightly misstating the nation's corruption ranking from Transparency International, he said, ""Our last rating was that we were the 38th most corrupt nation. That is still 37 steps better than when we were ranked the most corrupt."""10-Dec-07,CONGO (95%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%),"The main teaching hospital here is in such disrepair that many patients have to pay freelance porters for piggyback rides up and down the stairs to get X-rays. It costs $2 a flight, each way. But why is the hospital, like so much of the Congo Republic, so tattered when the country sells billions of dollars of oil each year? The government says it is still recovering from a devastating war and faces a new problem: Western investors, sensing a chance to rake in millions, are suing to recover old debts that they bought for pennies on the dollar. Such investors, running what critics derisively call vulture funds, have been widely denounced by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for forcing poor countries to fend off costly lawsuits rather than build classrooms and clinics. But in the Congo Republic, where a deep-seated culture of graft has squandered so much of the nation's wealth, those investors have become unexpected allies of anticorruption campaigners, who say such lawsuits may be the only way of holding the country accountable for how it spends its money. ''We ask ourselves, why is our country like this?'' said Dr. Bebene Bondzouzi-Ndamba, a neurologist at the hospital. ''Why are we so rich and yet so poor?'' Her questions have come into sharp relief in the fight between the Congo Republic and an affiliate of an American hedge fund, Elliott Associates. For an undisclosed price, the company bought about $31 million in debt that the country took on in the 1980s but later defaulted on. Now it is suing in American, European and Asian courts to collect the principal plus interest and penalties -- more than $100 million in all. So far, it has collected $39 million. Advocates of canceling third world debt recoil at such cases, with some calling for a code of conduct among lenders to prevent them from selling unpaid debts to investors. ''I deplore the activities of so-called vulture funds that seek to profit from the debts owed by the poorest countries,'' Gordon Brown said in May, the month before he became prime minister of Britain. ''I am determined to limit the damage done by such funds.'' But organizations that fight corruption argue that those investors are exposing in court the corrupt networks of government officials, providing a much-needed check on mineral-rich states. Beyond that, anticorruption campaigners, like the groups Global Witness and the Publish What You Pay Coalition, contend that when nations win debt relief without becoming more accountable, they will simply repeat old mistakes and end up deep in debt once again. ''If it were not for these vulture funds, we would not know any facts about the way our country's wealth is being taken away,'' said Brice Mackosso, a campaigner for greater transparency in the Congo Republic's government. ''We don't agree with their ultimate aims, but they are the only ones capable of exposing the truth.'' Critics argue that virtually all countries use their debt relief savings to help the poor, and that so-called vulture funds achieve outsize returns from long-forgotten debts at the expense of the world's poorest people. Cutting Both Ways While investor lawsuits may expose nefarious dealings, they may also make governments more secretive to avoid asset seizures.  ''It can cut both ways,'' said Mark Thomas, a senior economist at the World Bank. ''It can be a cause of revealing nontransparent practices, but it can also be a cause of those nontransparent practices in the first place.'' Debts are bought and sold all the time, and Western courts have awarded hundreds of millions of dollars in judgments to debt investors. Peru is the best-known example: In 2000, Elliott Associates, whose founder, Paul E. Singer, is a top Republican donor and a backer of Rudolph W. Giuliani's presidential campaign, won a $58 million judgment on debt it had bought in 1996 for $20 million. Now African countries are in the sights of debt investors. In 1979, Zambia borrowed $15 million from Romania to buy agricultural equipment. Twenty years later, the two governments agreed to settle the old debt for about $3 million. But a hedge fund, Donegal International, bought it first and sued for about $55 million. This year, a British court ruled that Zambia must pay Donegal $15 million. The plight of Zambia, a poor country stricken by AIDS, raised awareness of so-called vulture investing in Africa, and debt relief campaigners, celebrities and some members of the Bush administration have taken up the issue. Most creditors go along with debt reduction or write-off deals, and the Congo Republic has qualified under international programs for a reduction of much of the $8.5 million in debt it owed as of December  2004. Government officials here point to a slew of new projects under construction, like a hydroelectric dam, hundreds of miles of new roads and an emergency power plant as evidence that they are rebuilding the country. A June report from the I.M.F. noted that at least some progress has been made to address ''corruption and weak governance.'' Still, half the nation's population lacks access to clean water, according to Unicef. The lifetime risk of dying in childbirth for  women in the Congo Republic is 1 in 26, one of the world's highest rates. Life expectancy is just 53 years, down from 55 in 1990. That deprivation exists despite the significant amount of oil the country produces relative to its  3.8 million people -- 250,000 barrels a day. The litigation surrounding the country has unearthed a complex web of questionable practices that may have stripped untold millions of that oil money from the nation's treasury since 1997. Defense From Creditors In interviews,  officials here said the purpose of their complex transactions -- which, according to court documents, included discounted prices for well-connected companies -- was to avoid what it viewed as overzealous creditors. ''We are in a war, and we have to defend ourselves,'' said Alain Akouala, the Congo Republic's information minister. But the group Global Witness has seized on court records to tease out these connections between government officials, private companies and a French bank that set up oil transactions. The litigation has also exposed the free-spending habits of government officials. According to hotel bills, the country's president, Denis Sassou-Nguesso, paid $8,500 a night for a triplex suite at the New York Palace Hotel during a visit to the United Nations in 2005. His hotel bills in the United States in 2005 and 2006 added up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Officials here said that Mr. Sassou-Nguesso was simply staying in the same type of hotels as other heads of state. Another embarrassing find was the credit card bills of one of the president's sons, Denis Christel Sassou-Nguesso, who runs the marketing arm of the Congo Republic's state oil business, Cotrade. They showed large purchases from shops like Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton and Gucci, and a paper trail suggesting that companies receiving state oil business had paid for the purchases, Global Witness said. The world of luxury implied by those credit card bills is emblematic of the vast gap between the country's elite and its impoverished masses. The Congo Republic's main teaching hospital may be in terrible shape, but its director, Ignace Ngakala, works in a plush office outfitted with a large, lacquered wood desk and a high-backed leather chair. His office, he said, was recently renovated along with the delivery room in the maternity ward and a meeting room for medical conferences, complete with a state-of-the-art sound system. In his parking space sat a late-model Volkswagen sport utility vehicle that sells for about $50,000 in the United States. ''We are coming from war,'' he said, explaining why the elevator in one of the hospital buildings was not fixed. ''We are in the middle of a progressive renovation.'' Mr. Sassou-Nguesso, the president, first ruled the country as a Marxist-Leninist dictator, from 1979 to 1992, then seized power again in 1997. A brutal civil war followed, devastating the country. He was elected president in 2002, but the vote was deeply flawed because his main rivals were excluded, international observers say. Mr. Sassou-Nguesso's government has jettisoned its Communist past in favor of petro-capitalism. But aides say that the image of a free-spending kleptocrat is false, noting that here in the capital the president stays in the same modest home he has lived in since he was an army lieutenant. But in Pointe-Noire, the center of the Congo Republic's booming oil industry, Mr. Sassou-Nguesso lives in a sprawling oceanfront mansion. At a reception there in October, government ministers drank single-malt Scotch by the swimming pool, while Mr. Sassou-Nguesso sipped Champagne from a cut-crystal glass. In an interview, Mr. Sassou-Nguesso said his government was committed to transparency and posts oil revenues on a Web site. It also submits to independent audits, as requested by the International Monetary Fund. Both Sides Point Fingers He criticized as immoral the private creditors seeking to gain from the Congo Republic's misery, and rejected the notion that debt investors could play a positive role in exposing corruption. ''Vulture funds cannot give us lessons,'' he said. In a statement, Elliott Associates said it could not be blamed for the Congo Republic's problems. ''The poor in developing countries are poor because the political and economic systems in their countries have failed them,'' the statement said. According to Justice Department records, the Congo Republic's  government has spent $3.3 million  this year and last to hire lobbyists and lawyers to press its cause in Congress and in the news media, including the firms of Washington heavyweights like Plato Cacheris and Bob Livingston. Their efforts have borne some fruit in the form of Congressional hearings on the impact of debt investors, and news articles about Mr. Singer's contributions to Mr. Giuliani's presidential campaign. Caught in the middle of this fight are schoolchildren, like 10-year-old Laurent Mbemba in Pointe-Noire. His school has 3,583 students. Its three latrines are broken. Many teachers have not been paid in years -- they get by on donations from parents. Rain pours in thundering sheets onto the tin roof, dribbling through rust holes onto the children beneath. The classrooms are so packed -- as many as 200 a class -- that many children sit on the cement floor, notebooks perched on their narrow thighs. ''There aren't enough desks for everyone,'' Laurent said. The school's principal, Martial Itsouhou, said the school received virtually no assistance from the government. ''Our country exports wood, but we have no desks,'' Mr. Itsouhou said. ''Our children are literally learning on their knees. We don't know where the money goes. We just pray for help.''"11-Jan-08,KENYA (98%); AFRICA (94%); GHANA (92%); UNITED STATES (79%),"With no sign of a breakthrough in the Kenyan political crisis, it appears that a high-profile mediator may be flying in to help: Kofi Annan. The African Union announced on Thursday that Mr. Annan, the former secretary general of the United Nations, was taking over the role played by President John Kufuor of Ghana, who is also the chairman of the African Union. Mr. Kufuor spent the past two days in Kenya trying to broker a truce between the government and opposition leaders to end the crisis here, which erupted after flawed elections last month and left hundreds dead from violence. Mr. Kufuor failed to get the two sides even to meet, but he insisted that all was not lost. ''Both sides agreed there should be an end to the violence, and they also agreed there should be dialogue,'' he  said. Mr. Annan will lead a panel of African dignitaries who are coming to try to bring the two sides together, Mr. Kufuor said. There was no immediate comment from Mr. Annan about the new role, but Ban Ki-moon, his successor at the United Nations, views the choice as a ''positive development'' and called Mr. Annan on Thursday morning to express his ''strong support,'' Mr. Ban's spokeswoman said. Many diplomats here are pessimistic that a solution will be found anytime soon because neither Mwai Kibaki, Kenya's president, nor Raila Odinga, the top opposition leader, is budging. Both claim to have won the presidential election on Dec. 27. Western observers have said that there was widespread evidence that the president's party interfered with the vote tallying process and rigged the results to stay in power. Mr. Kibaki has moved ahead with unilaterally naming cabinet members, which opposition leaders called a ''slap in the face'' and which American officials called disappointing. On Thursday, opposition leaders said Mr. Kibaki refused to sign an agreement that had been approved by the World Bank that recommended a transitional government and an investigation into the election results. World Bank officials in Kenya did not return phone calls. Alfred Mutua, a Kenyan government spokesman, said that the document had been prepared by World Bank officials and that the president rejected it because it was ''meant to favor certain groups.'' Both the government and opposition leaders, who have blamed each other for the surprise burst of bloodletting in such a stable country as Kenya, are now blaming each other for the lack of progress in negotiations. ''The government had offered dialogue, which was to be facilitated by President John Kufuor, but Orange Democratic Movement leaders have not been responsive,'' a government statement said, referring to Mr. Odinga's political movement. Salim Lone, an Odinga spokesman,  said: ''The government was obviously never serious about negotiations. To tell you the truth, we're getting discouraged.''"20-Jan-08,"AFRICA (93%); AFGHANISTAN (92%); LATIN AMERICA (79%); RUSSIAN FEDERATION (79%); ETHIOPIA (79%); ASIA (79%); SINGAPORE (79%); MALAWI (79%); PAKISTAN (79%); MIDDLE EAST (79%); CHILE (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%); VENEZUELA, BOLIVARIAN REPUBLIC OF (79%); IRAN, ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF (79%); ZIMBABWE (79%); NIGERIA (79%); IRAQ (79%); THAILAND (75%)","Janine di Giovanni is the author of ''Madness Visible: A Memoir of War.'' The Struggle to Build Free Societies Throughout the World. By Larry Diamond. 448 pp. Times Books/Henry Holt & Company. $28. H. L. Mencken once wrote that ''democracy is only a dream: it should be put in the same category as Arcadia, Santa Claus and Heaven.'' Reading through Larry Diamond's dense study of the global quest for democracy, one reckons Mencken may have been right. It's painfully obvious that many countries have gone cruelly backward in the past decade -- Vladimir Putin's Russia, for example, or Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe or Pervez Musharraf's Pakistan. Diamond is a meticulous social scientist who, in ''Squandered Victory,'' took on the task of studying America's bungled effort to bring democracy to Iraq. ''The Spirit of Democracy'' takes on the world, with Diamond leaping from Malawi to Singapore to Venezuela. He looks at countries that broke down after the post-1974 ''third wave'' of democracy and have yet to recover, not only obvious examples like corruption-ridden Nigeria, but also Nepal, Thailand and the Solomon Islands. He studies what he calls ''the pathology of personal rule'' in Africa, along with the role of monarchy, populism and Islam in the Middle East. One might easily assume from such a discouraging survey that ''The Spirit of Democracy'' is a gigantic downer. In fact, Diamond is anything but pessimistic: he believes that most of the world, one way or another, can move toward democracy. ''By the mid-1990s,'' he writes, ''it had become clear to me, as it had to many of my colleagues involved in the global struggle for democracy, that if some three-fifths of the world's states (many of them poor and non-Western) could become democracies, there was no intrinsic reason why the rest of the world could not do as well.'' He even throws countries like China and Iran into this equation. Diamond can be optimistic because he compares the present, with all of its setbacks, to 1974, when he was a student leader during the protests against the Vietnam War. In those days, he reminds us, democracy was not the way of the world. ''Barely a quarter of independent states chose their governments through competitive, free and fair elections.'' There were Marxist and nationalist insurgencies in Asia and Africa. Haile Selassie was soon to fall in Ethiopia, which, Diamond notes, would leave ''almost all of sub-Saharan Africa ... under military or one-party rule.'' There was repressive military rule in Latin America, including Chile, where the military had overthrown the democratically elected Allende government. Totalitarianism had the Soviet Union and the Eastern European satellite states in a vise-like grip. Elsewhere, havoc prevailed. The Khmer Rouge would soon take over in Cambodia and ultimately be responsible for the death of an estimated one to two million people (out of a total population of seven million). In the Arab world, only Lebanon was a democracy. The American government, meanwhile, was obsessed with the cold-war struggle against Communist expansion and was disengaging from a war in Southeast Asia that had cost the lives of 58,000 of its citizens, as well as several million Vietnamese. At that time, Diamond set out on a journey to see where changes were occurring, for good and bad. His first stop was Portugal. A few months earlier, the Movement of the Armed Forces had overthrown a nearly 50-year dictatorship; that is, a military coup had overthrown a quasi-fascist dictatorship. Diamond watched as Communist and other political forces tried to thrash out a new government. Then he moved south to Nigeria, Africa's biggest and most promising democracy. It was, however, ''a country in an economic and political fever,'' flush with oil but broken down from the brutal Biafran conflict. From Africa, Diamond went on to the Middle East, to Egypt and Israel, each emerging from the trauma of the 1973 war. Next it was Thailand, ''trying to find its footing,'' and Taiwan, which he calls ''one of the key authoritarian states in the East Asian miracle.'' In a sense, that expansive journey inspired Diamond's life work. What he gleaned from his experience was the theory that the fate of democracy was not driven by historical events or even structural forces but by the passion and zeal of individual people. ''It is a consequence of struggle, strategy, ingenuity, vision, courage,'' he writes, adding that the places where democracy worked took genuine commitment, talent, nerve and the obvious passion for freedom -- ''politics in the best sense of the word.'' As an example, he cites Serbia's extraordinary ''bulldozer'' revolution in October 2000, in which a democratic alliance of opposition parties, a group of students armed with cellphones and a bunch of farmers riding tractors into Belgrade managed to mobilize a million people for peaceful resistance. They toppled Slobodan Milosevic's iron-fisted rule -- something the inefficient politicians were unable to do throughout a decade of brutal wars and economic breakdown. That peaceful revolution became a model throughout the region, most notably in Georgia and Ukraine. ''The Spirit of Democracy'' asks whether democracy is something that can exist only in rich and educated countries, those with a strong middle class. Do all people actually want democracy, or do some -- the Chinese perhaps -- believe that a form of authoritarianism is the best way to run a country? To answer this question, Diamond examines the forces that contribute to democracy, from the internal influences that give rise to civil societies to the impact of peaceful outside pressures like diplomatic persuasion or, in some cases, economic sanctions. He highlights the work of the National Endowment for Democracy, founded in 1983 to promote democracy abroad, and the democratic assistance it successfully provided to Poland and Nicaragua. Diamond is at his best when he recounts how ordinary people affect the democratic process. He tells us, for instance, about Alejandro Toledo, the former Peruvian leader, who worked his way up from tending sheep and pigs as an ''Indian rebellious of poverty'' to become an ambitious and idealistic president. Toledo's five-year term was not a success politically, but Diamond uses it as a lesson to indicate what might work in Latin America. Interviews with Chinese and African democratic leaders show us idealistic individuals bravely seeking change. Similarly, when Diamond speaks of contemporary Russia, a place where he believes democracy has strikingly receded since the days of Boris Yeltsin, he points to courageous journalists like Anna Politkovskaya, murdered for attempting to write the truth. Oil is a major part of the story of Russia's democratic retreat, as it is for many other nations. None of the 23 countries whose economies are dominated by what Diamond calls ''the exceptional curse of oil'' are democracies. From Algeria to Venezuela, he chillingly reminds us, ''all of the oil-rich countries of the world remained under or returned to authoritarian rule after 1974 and the third wave of democratization.'' When oil revenues surge, he writes, democracy declines. Diamond's book is not for everyone. It's overloaded with comparative statistics, World Bank data and ratings from Freedom House. Reading it takes true commitment. But it offers well-grounded support to anyone who has questioned the long-held theory of Seymour Martin Lipset that the richer the country, the greater the chances of sustaining democracy. Third world countries are not destined to lurch from dictator to dictator, Diamond insists. Even places like Burundi and Sierra Leone, he points out, became democracies after the brutality and violence of bloody civil wars (although they are vulnerable to risk). Democracy may be a luxury, but it isn't a question of wealth. It all comes down to the energy and commitment of people. Indeed, the message of Diamond's book is summed up by its dedication to three icons of democracy: Gandhi, Vaclav Havel and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Diamond makes the hopeful prediction that even ''countries like Iran and China, which now seem so immune to the global democratic trend, stand a very good chance of becoming democratic in the next two to three decades.'' ''And if China can democratize,'' Diamond asks, ''why not the entire world?''"7-Feb-08,CHAD (99%); SUDAN (97%); UNITED STATES (93%); AFRICA (92%); FRANCE (90%); NORTHERN AFRICA (79%); CAMEROON (79%); CENTRAL AFRICA (79%); EUROPE (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (79%),"N'DJAMENA, the capital of Chad, is hundreds of miles from Darfur. But the violence in Chad over the past few days is closely linked to the Sudanese government's bloody campaign to subdue Darfur. Some of Darfur's rebels enjoy sanctuary in eastern Chad as well as other support from the government of President Idriss Dby. Meanwhile, Chadian rebel groups are clients of President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan. Their assault on N'djamena, which began Saturday, left civilians dead and sent thousands of refugees streaming into nearby Cameroon. Widening the regional conflict by taking it to the streets of a neighboring country certainly serves Mr. Bashir's interests in punishing a regional enemy -- and diverting international attention from Darfur. The rebel strike happened as a U.N. peacekeeping force is struggling to get on the ground in Darfur; deployment of a French-led European Union force to protect refugees in eastern Chad, which Mr. Bashir opposes, was suspended as a result. For the time being, it appears that Mr. Dby has quelled the attack with the help of France, which maintains  1,900 troops and a squadron of fighter planes in Chad. President Nicolas Sarkozy engineered a U.N. Security Council resolution supporting Mr. Dby and alluded to possible military intervention to save him. ""If France must do its duty, it will do so,"" Mr. Sarkozy said. Paris's stance in this oil-rich former colony, however, is not a case study in foreign policy idealism. Mr. Dby is a dictator; one reason he is vulnerable to revolt is that he has governed in the narrow interests of his own ethnic group, the Zagawa. Among his recent initiatives was to renege on his promise to the World Bank to dedicate almost 90 percent of oil pipeline revenue to fighting poverty. Yet Mr. Dby also has enjoyed good relations with the Bush administration, which has trained and equipped members of his presidential guard to fight Islamist terrorists based in North Africa. Given the Chadian rebels' links to Sudan, the United States and France probably have little choice but to help prevent them from seizing power in Chad. A rebel victory would bring on only more refugee outflows, an inevitable counterattack and a spiraling war that could engulf all of north-central Africa. There can be no blank check for Chad's ruler, however. Both Washington and Paris need to push him to end corruption and human rights abuses. The World Bank cut off funding to Chad after its grab for oil money; the flow of dollars was restored in return for new Chadian promises to aid the poor, and those must be kept. Human rights monitors report that members of the civilian opposition in N'djamena have been rounded up amid the fighting -- portending a possible repeat of the torture and executions that occurred during a 2006 rebel offensive. At a minimum, Mr. Dby must prevent that, if he wants to retain his deservedly tenuous hold on international  sympathy."6-May-08,SOUTH AFRICA (95%),"The head of South Africa's Scorpions crime-fighting unit, Leonard McCarthy, was appointed Monday to lead the World Bank's anticorruption department, a day after the South African government said it would disband the unit.

They promised to create a global partnership of governments and nonprofits to address the food crisis that threatens to wipe out recent gains on the continent. They instituted new ""accountability"" procedures to ensure that wealthy countries fulfill their promises of aid to Africa. And they issued a sharply worded statement questioning the legitimacy of the government of President Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe. Much of the public focus of the summit was on global warming. On Tuesday,  G-8 leaders pledged efforts for a 50 percent reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions. On the same day, China, India, Brazil and other developing countries offered a competing plan, saying in a statement that not all countries could adopt such a target and that  developed countries must bear the burden as the biggest polluters. But how to address Africa's disease, poverty and political strife also ranked as an important theme at the gathering, which ended Wednesday. To emphasize these issues, the G-8 leaders had invited seven African heads of state and government to deliberate with them at the gathering, held at a Japanese resort. Africa has been a particular interest for President Bush, and his aides pronounced themselves pleased by progress at the summit, particularly new initiatives to train health workers, address tropical disease and provide 100,000 mosquito nets to help prevent malaria. With U.S. prodding, the G-8 also released reports detailing progress -- or lack of it -- that African countries have made in meeting health and anti-corruption goals. ""The lesson of this summit is that the emphasis is on implementation and on delivery,"" said British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. ""The emphasis is on turning words into action and making them far more concrete than ever they have been in the past."" Before leaving Japan for Washington, Bush also hailed ""progress on alleviating sickness in Africa."" He told reporters that ""we had a comprehensive agenda on helping those who are being affected by disease live healthy lives."" But many nonprofit and advocacy groups that sent people to observe the summit were more critical. Many expressed alarm over recent studies showing that the G-8 will probably miss its overall development goals unless it dramatically steps up efforts. The United States is not viewed as in danger of missing its target, but many activists think it is not doing enough relative to its wealth and size. There were also signs that the U.S. demand of accountability on aid assistance is rubbing some allies the wrong way. Fabrice Ferrier, who works for a nongovernmental group in France, said there is a belief the United States sometimes wants to measure only those areas in which it measures up well. Others saw the final G-8 language on accountability as relatively modest. Kel Currah of World Vision International, a Christian relief and development organization, applauded the U.S. initiative but said the bigger problem is that issues such as AIDS and food demand more money than the Group of Eight is willing to consider. ""Accountability is good,"" Currah said. But accountability for low aid numbers ""is not going to achieve the desired impact we are all looking for. We need more money."" One senior U.S. official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, acknowledged resistance from some countries over accountability but said this year is only a start. ""You might say it doesn't sound like a lot, but we think we worked to really embed the idea of G-8 accountability,"" he said. He noted that the G-8 for the first time spelled out a five-year time frame for spending $60 billion to combat AIDS and other diseases in Africa; last year, it promised the money but was vague about how long it would take to spend it. A more fundamental concern among activists and experts on Africa is whether the passion has disappeared from the G-8 effort on the continent. Several said the collective effort on addressing the food crisis was tepid, compared to the problem: While G-8 leaders said this week they have committed $10 billion to addressing the issue, the cost is likely to be much greater, according to Sam Worthington, president of InterAction, a coalition of U.S. nonprofits focused on world poverty. ""The good news is that the World Bank is beginning to try to lead a process, but to some extent we are treating the food crisis as an expansion of business-as-usual, as opposed to really leading a new effort,"" Worthington said in a telephone interview from Washington. One problem is expectations. Almost anything the G-8 does these days will pale compared with what was done at Gleneagles, where the industrialized countries committed themselves to dramatically increase assistance to Africa, said J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""In retrospect, the targets they agreed to at Gleneagles appear to have been a stretch,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""Several of the member governments simply are not going to meet their targets. The commitments were unrealistic with good intentions."" But, he said, concluding that there has been a serious failure misses ""the bigger story -- which is the core of African governments are doing pretty well."""10-Jul-08,NIGERIA (99%); UNITED STATES (92%); NIGER (92%); AUSTRALIA (79%); AFRICA (79%); FRANCE (75%); SWITZERLAND (72%),"It's hard to rehabilitate a country -- especially Nigeria, best known these days for violence in the oil-producing Niger Delta. But Nduka Obaigbena is used to long odds. The Nigerian media mogul -- part Bono, part P. Diddy -- has been challenging his country's often brutal kleptocracy for decades. And, in what passes for high praise from the organization that has consistently rated Nigeria one of the most corrupt nations in the world, Nancy Z. Boswell, president and chief executive of Transparency International-USA, says of Mr. Obaigbena's efforts to clean up his country, ''There is reason to be cautiously optimistic.'' Mr. Obaigbena (pronounced Oh-bayg-BEH-na) has more enthusiastic fans. ''Nduka obviously has a remarkable vision, real passion and a special message,'' said Naomi Campbell, the supermodel and a converted admirer. ''He's not just a promoter. The more I found out, the more I wanted to be involved.'' So did John Howard, the former Australian prime minister. ''There are so many investment opportunities at present that good governance is going to be quite material in where that investment goes,'' he said by phone from Sydney. ''Obaigbena is striking a blow for the truer path.'' But can a party save a country? Every year since 2000, Mr. Obaigbena has honored Nigerians who fight graft or injustice, in particular government officials and corporate executives who exemplify good governance through financial transparency, accountability and respect for the law. But he celebrates them by hosting the likes of Ms. Campbell and Mr. Howard at star-filled events, including the ThisDay Awards, named for his media empire and the influential independent newspaper at its center. The last awards ceremony was attended by politicians and socialites, including Mr. Howard, former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin of France and Paul Begala, a former adviser to Bill Clinton. Since 2006, Mr. Obaigbena has also held a mammoth summer concert series promoting Nigeria's economic and political progress, the ThisDay festival, luring the likes of Beyonce, Jay-Z, P. Diddy and Shakira to perform in Lagos. The next concert, Africa Rising, is scheduled to take place in Abuja on Friday, starring Mary J. Blige, Usher and Rihanna, as well as Ms. Campbell. On Aug. 1, it travels to the Kennedy Center in Washington, headlined by Beyonce and Seal. To some observers, the lavishness of Mr. Obaigbena and his events -- he brought in a dome from Davos, Switzerland, for the 2008 awards -- undermines their credibility and their message. ''All this talk about good governance does not go beyond sloganeering,'' said Philip Ikita, a Nigerian journalist, sociologist and development worker. ''We who have stayed connected with our rural population know that there is no progress for the Nigerian people.'' Mr. Obaigbena disagrees. ''We have the longest period of democracy in Nigeria, ever,'' said the mogul in March, sitting in a suite at the St. Regis in New York. ''We have new leadership. We have to sustain that momentum.'' Though no one is saying Mr. Obaigbena is responsible for those changes, he has become their promoter, just as he promotes his glittery events. And his optimism is not completely unwarranted. To be sure, half of Nigeria's population lacks access to potable water, and the infant mortality rate is 1 in 10 births. But foreign investment nearly quadrupled from 2000 to 2006, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Because of  a financial restructuring and swelling oil prices, Nigeria has almost no foreign debt, almost $50 billion in foreign reserves and a growing trade surplus. Sectors other than oil have grown, too: in 2007, Nigeria's telecommunications industry was set to overtake South Africa's as the largest on the continent. ''Among our clients, particularly banks, hedge funds and investors, there is a lot of interest in Nigeria,'' said Sebastian Spio-Garbrah, an analyst for the Eurasia Group, a New York-based political risk analysis consultancy. Crucial to that interest is the progression of Nigeria's anticorruption efforts, which began in 2002 with the establishment of the Economic and Federal Crimes Commission. With $380 billion looted from the government treasury since independence in 1960, Nigeria has become synonymous with graft. Its vast oil resources ''will not be enough to attract foreign investment if there were a complete loss of confidence in governance,'' said Mr. Howard. What role Mr. Obaigbena's ThisDay Award has had in encouraging good governance is impossible to say -- it has honored people whose efforts are already well known. Winners have included Bukola Saraki, the governor of Kwara state who invited Zimbabwean farmers persecuted by the regime of President Robert Mugabe to resettle in Nigeria; and Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the former finance minister who negotiated $18 billion in debt relief for Nigeria and was named managing director of the World Bank in 2007. Last year, ThisDay honored Nuhu Ribadu, the anticorruption chief who oversaw 200 convictions in Nigeria since 2003, bringing down several senators, governors and a former chief of police. Still, Mr. Obaigbena has not abjured the trappings of power. An elegant man with a blunt, chiefly demeanor and a taste for bespoke Lanvin suits, he maintains a home in Lagos, a country estate in Nigeria's Delta State and a penthouse at the Ritz Carlton in Washington. He will not disclose his net worth, but says that ThisDay's corporate parent, Leaders and Company, of which he owns 95 percent, had $100 million in revenue in 2007. He earned $20 million from real estate and stock holdings. ''I like to live modestly and discreetly,'' said Mr. Obaigbena, with no trace of irony. Outside Nigeria, paparazzi frequently snap him in velvet-rope settings with the likes of Lil' Kim and Ice-T. ''He's a larger-than-life personality,'' said Bayo Alade-Loba, head of sub-Saharan banking for Credit Suisse. A descendant of the Ika, one of the smaller of Nigeria's 200 ethnic tribal groups, Mr. Obaigbena began ThisDay as a weekly, then called ThisWeek, in 1987. During a violent government crackdown on the press in the late 1990s, he was arrested for publishing articles criticizing the military regime of Gen. Sani Abacha. ''Scores of journalists were arrested and killed,'' he said. ''The publisher of our competing paper, The Guardian, was shot and almost died.'' After a brief detention, Mr. Obaigbena went into exile for two years, returning just a month after Mr. Abacha's death. ThisDay has continued to be a lightning rod. A 2002 editorial criticizing Islamic officials for condemning the Miss World pageant led to ThisDay's offices being ransacked and burned; fatwas were issued against its editors. In December 2006, the editorial board chairman, Godwin Agbroko, winner of the 1997 PEN Freedom to Write Award and a fearless critic of Nigeria's ruling party, was found in his car after work hours, fatally shot in the neck. The next month, ThisDay's offices suffered another arson attack. ''We get threats every day,'' Mr. Obaigbena said. ''But it doesn't matter. We'll keep speaking the truth.'' At the next festival and awards, Mr. Obaigbena plans to sound the drum for microfinance as the way to empower Nigeria's 146 million people. As he sees it, if the sleeping giant that is this consumer market, the largest in Africa, were to rouse, ''African superpower'' would no longer be a contradiction. ''It's a new country emerging,'' he said. ''And it's time to showcase it.''"11-Sep-08,CHAD (96%); SENEGAL (79%); CAMEROON (79%); AFRICA (79%),"When the World Bank agreed in 2000 to help finance a $4.2 billion pipeline to tap the undeveloped oil wealth of Chad, one of the world's poorest and most unstable nations, the agreement was a novel response to a persistent African quandary: how to make the continent's rich natural resources pay off for its people, not only for its powerful. The strategy was to use the World Bank's money and credibility to persuade Chad to dedicate its earnings from oil to attacking its poverty by building schools, roads and hospitals. That experiment ended quietly this week. Chad repaid the $65.7 million it owed the World Bank out of national coffers swollen by more than $1 billion a year in oil revenues, but it had not honored its bargain, the bank said. ''Chad failed to comply with the key requirements of this agreement,'' the World Bank said in a statement on Tuesday. ''The government did not allocate adequate resources critical for poverty reduction.'' Thus concluded one of the most ambitious efforts to escape Africa's ''resource curse,'' wherein the wealth of mineral-rich nations gets siphoned by corrupt officials. Under the plan, the World Bank helped finance a 665-mile pipeline for an oil consortium led by Exxon Mobil, linking oil fields in southern Chad with Atlantic Ocean terminals in Cameroon. In exchange, the government of Chad agreed to channel most of its royalties into fighting poverty. An independent oversight board was to approve or deny spending projects based on their prospects for reducing poverty. But it never really worked that way. In May 2005 the board, in a damning investigation, found that much of the money was being wasted on abuses like shoddy school desks made of buckled wood, computers and printers purchased at inflated prices, and wells, schools and hospitals that were paid for but not completed. Life has gone from bad to worse for most people in this landlocked country. According to Unicef, child mortality  rose from 1990 to 2006. Only one adult in four is literate, and 37 percent of children are underweight. Civic groups and opposition political parties had opposed the pipeline, saying Chad was too corrupt and poorly governed to manage the gusher of oil money. ''We knew from the very beginning how this would end,'' said Antoine Berilengar, a Roman Catholic priest and anticorruption activist in Chad who served on the oversight panel. ''Chad is a corrupt country with no real democracy. The government has simply enriched itself.'' Ian Gary, an Oxfam America specialist in managing mineral resources, said it was no surprise that the experiment had failed. ''The World Bank made a gamble,'' he said. ''It knew the situation in Chad going in, but it argued it could build the capacity of the Chadian government and the governance situation would improve alongside the oil boom. But what we have seen in Chad and in so many other places, it is that boom and that flow of revenue that undermines governance rather than improving it.'' Chad's government repeatedly tried to change the World Bank arrangement. It argued that the threats it faced from a rebellion and from the humanitarian crisis that spilled over from the neighboring Darfur region of Sudan required it to  spend oil money on security. In 2006 a compromise was reached that gave the government a freer hand, but the terms were never fully respected. The World Bank agreement was conceived in the late 1990s, when oil sold for about $20 a barrel, making the prospect of building a 665-mile pipeline through deepest Africa a money-losing proposition. That has all changed -- Chad produces 170,000 barrels a day and expects to collect $1.4 billion in oil revenues this year. Michel Wormser, the bank's director of operations for Africa, said by telephone that the World Bank would continue to help Chad invest its oil windfall in fighting poverty. But he said the demise of the pipeline deal showed that a nation's mineral resources could benefit its people only if ''the government is truly committed to sharing these resources in an inclusive manner.''"21-Mar-09,ANGOLA (98%); AFRICA (94%); UNITED STATES (92%); PORTUGAL (79%); CAMEROON (79%),"Pope Benedict XVI, midway through his first trip to Africa, arrived in oil-rich Angola on Friday and admonished those enjoying the nation's newfound wealth not to ignore the justifiable demands of the poor. ''The multitude of Angolans who live below the threshold of absolute poverty will not be forgotten,'' he said in a speech moments after getting off his airplane. ''Do not disappoint their expectations!'' In a second address, this one delivered hours later at the residence of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, he challenged Angola and other African countries to free their people ''from the scourges of greed, violence and unrest'' through ''modern civic democracy.'' He defined this civic liberation as one respectful of human rights with transparent governance, an independent judiciary, a free press, properly functioning schools and hospitals, ''and -- most pressing -- a determination born from the conversion of hearts to excise corruption.'' These antidotes to kleptocratic government are commonly prescribed for Africa in general and this nation in particular. But if the message was difficult to swallow, President dos Santos showed no signs of discomfort as he stood only feet away from Benedict. The pope is a prestigious visitor for a man who has held power for 29 years while running for election only once. ''If I were the president and I heard what the pope said, I would conclude that he thought the real issue in my country was my own leadership,'' said Fernando Macedo, a professor of constitutional law here in Luanda, the capital, and a frequent critic of Mr. dos Santos. But in companion speeches, Mr. dos Santos seemed to agree with the pope's every exhortation. ''Yes, there is a necessity to help those in need,'' he said, ruing a national unemployment rate he put at 48 percent and the lack of water and electricity in 60 percent of all homes. He said Angola was devoting billions of dollars to solving its substantial problems. Angola, which is about twice the size of Texas, may be a nation with a vaguely familiar ring to many Americans. Seven years ago, it emerged from a civil war that dated back nearly three decades to some of the most chilling times of the cold war, when conflict here was thought vital to the interests of the United States, the Soviet Union, Cuba and apartheid-era South Africa. The fighting laid waste to most of the infrastructure that dated back to the days of Portuguese colonizers, and left the land so seeded with explosives that the accumulation of land mines roughly equaled the number of people. But peace finally allowed the government to exploit Angola's natural wealth of diamonds and petroleum. This soon seemed a nation poised to lift much of its population -- variously estimated at 14 million to 20 million -- from penury. And yet so far, revenues have mostly supported the ostentatious consumption of a free-spending elite. Two-thirds of the country's people still live on less than $2 a day, according to the World Bank. Angolans, if lacking in purse, are rich in faith. ''This is a very religious country, and though not all of it is Catholic, almost all is religious,'' said the Rev. Mauricio Camuto, the director of Radio Ecclesia, a Catholic radio station and one of the few independent voices in the Angolan news media. ''Go anywhere in the provinces, even among 20 huts, you will find a church.'' Pope Benedict's predecessor, John Paul II, made 42 visits to Africa during his nearly 27-year papacy. There are an estimated 158 million Catholics on the continent, and the huge growth of the church in Africa during the past century is widely seen as one of its greatest missionary feats -- as well as its likely future, with church attendance in deep decline in Europe. Some 70 percent of Angola is Catholic, President dos Santos said Friday. Other estimates put the number at 55 to 65 percent. Cameroon was the first stop in Africa for Benedict. He spent three days there, and his trip to Angola will end Monday morning. For the government, the pope's visit is a geopolitical coming of age. ''The Angolans see themselves as a continental power, and the pope's visit is a further reaffirmation of that,'' said the United States ambassador, Dan Mozena. For the masses, the papal visit is an unprecedented thrill. Friday was declared a national holiday, and in the morning, the main street from the airport -- Revolucao de Outubro -- was well lined with thousands of people hours before the pope arrived. Churches had bused in the faithful, most of them already wearing T-shirts that commemorated the occasion. ''I want to be reborn in heaven,'' some chanted in Kimbundu, one of the local languages. Others sang in Portuguese, ''Pope, our friend, Angola is with you!'' Small paper banners carried Benedict's face on one side and the Angolan flag on the other. In the plane en route from Rome to Africa, the pope had renewed the church's objection to the use of condoms as a prevention against AIDS, going so far as to say this precaution actually ''increases the problem'' of H.I.V. infection. Africa is the continent hardest hit by the AIDS pandemic, and many activists, medical researchers and politicians quickly took issue with the pope's statement, calling it unscientific and dangerous. Most people in the anticipating crowd were aware of the controversy. ''The only people who use condoms are those with no faith,'' said Simba Teresa, a 45-year-old street vendor, trying to wave away the heat with a continuing flap of her hand. She said three of her five children had died as infants, a common story in a country with one of the worst child mortality rates in the world. ''Faith is everything,'' she said. ''You put your life in God's hands.''"7-Apr-09,SOUTH AFRICA (94%); AFRICA (92%),"Corruption charges against Jacob Zuma -- the man almost certain to become South Africa's president after elections later this month -- were dropped Monday by prosecutors who said the case had been tainted by a tawdry, secret manipulation of the legal process from within their own ranks. The case has deeply divided the country and struck at one of its core political questions: how to uphold the rule of law, a particular point of pride in this nascent democracy, when the nation is dominated by a single party and the party's most influential figures vie for power. South Africa has the continent's largest economy, and while the decision to halt the prosecution may spare the country the discomfort of being led by a defendant in a corruption case, it did not resolve the underlying allegations that Mr. Zuma, the leader of the governing African National Congress, thrived off 783 payments over a decade's time from a convicted briber. ''It's very sad to see Africa's major country now going down the same route by which corruption is easily excused by political authorities in other African countries,'' said Laurence Cockcroft, a board member of the British chapter of Transparency International, an anticorruption  group. In recent years, the Zuma case has dominated this nation's political discourse, leading to a split within the A.N.C. and providing a rallying cry for Mr. Zuma's supporters to oust President Thabo Mbeki  in September. For the past two weeks, news organizations reported that after years of pursuing Mr. Zuma, the National Prosecuting Authority was suddenly considering a withdrawal of the charges. Mokotedi Mpshe, the acting head of the agency, who had previously pursued the case, began the much anticipated news conference on Monday by lamenting that he had ''painful facts'' to present and that he hoped the nation would ''find ways to learn from this bitter experience.'' He said the Zuma case had been irredeemably spoiled by ''collusion'' between two of his erstwhile colleagues: Bulelani Ngcuka, a former head of the prosecuting agency, and Leonard McCarthy, the onetime chief of an elite unit of investigators known as the Scorpions. Proof of their misconduct, Mr. Mpshe said, had been submitted to prosecutors by Mr. Zuma's legal team, which had come into possession of wiretaps  by the National Intelligence Agency. Transcripts of some of those recorded conversations were made public on Monday, and they seemed to show the former colleagues discussing ways to time the charges against Mr. Zuma, who was then locked in a battle for leadership of the A.N.C. with Mr. Mbeki, his archrival. In December 2007, Mr. Zuma won the A.N.C. vote. Shortly after, Mr. McCarthy said, ''I am Thabo man'' and appeared to allude to a visit with Mr. Mbeki. ''Saw the man on Friday evening, we planning a comeback strategy and once we have achieved that, we will clean up all around us, my friend,'' he said, according to the transcript. Within a few days, the prosecuting authority had filed a new indictment against Mr. Zuma. These and other conversations, Mr. Mpshe said, led him to conclude that ''an intolerable abuse has occurred which compels a discontinuation of the prosecution.'' The ''prosecution team itself'' disagreed, preferring that the decision be left to a court, he added. But he said he believed that the prosecuting authority must be ''beyond reproach.'' Willie Hofmeyr, his deputy director, said the decision proved South Africa's commitment to due process. He  likened the situation to a criminal suspect's being freed because of an improper search warrant. ''We do need to have clean hands,'' he said. Contacted late  Monday, Mr. Mbeki's spokesman, Mukoni Ratshitanga, said he had no comment on  the transcripts. ''I think you must pose those questions to Mr. McCarthy, not me,'' he said. Mr. McCarthy joined the World Bank in June to head its Department of Institutional Integrity. He was not immediately available for comment. Mr. Ngcuka told the South African Press Association he ''wanted to study the statement'' made at the news conference before responding. For Zuma supporters, the decision on Monday was seen as a vindication of their leader, who has argued from the start that the charges were politically motivated. Gwede Mantashe, the A.N.C.'s secretary general, called it ''a victory for the rule of law, democracy and common sense.'' Mr. Zuma, 66, is widely viewed as a populist, a man of the people with a propensity to break out in dance after delivering a speech. After the announcement, there were celebrations across the country with thousands dancing in jubilation and singing Mr. Zuma's trademark anthem, ''Bring Me My Machine Gun.'' But South Africa is badly torn over the Zuma case, and the dividing line is not as simple as a belief in guilt or innocence. Some Zuma supporters are willing to accept his culpability but protest his being singled out among a larger group of presumed profiteers in government. One poll of A.N.C. voters taken last October showed that only 41 percent thought him to be innocent. Among Mr. Zuma's detractors, the decision on Monday was seen as an outrage that, while not unexpected, was nevertheless another sign that the nation's justice system was malleable to manipulation by the powerful. Helen Zille, leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance, said that with elections coming on April 22, the prosecuting authority had finally ''buckled to political pressure.'' Patricia De Lille, leader of the Independent Democrats, said that opposition groups were considering  joining in some kind of legal challenge that might resurrect the  charges. ''The first casualty is the principle of all are equal before the law,'' she said. Mr. Zuma had been charged with 12 counts of fraud, two more of corruption and one each of money laundering and racketeering. The case was built around payments made to him by his close friend and financial adviser Schabir Shaik, who was convicted in 2005 of bribing Mr. Zuma in return for smoothing his way into various deals. According to prosecutors, Mr. Zuma used Mr. Shaik the way others might employ an A.T.M., extracting cash for items like family vacations, medical bills and even traffic fines. If Mr. Shaik was guilty, many here wondered, how could the verdict be otherwise for Mr. Zuma? Indeed, the trial judge in the Shaik case found there to be a ''mutually beneficial symbiosis'' between the men, and an appellate court said ''the only reasonable inference'' about Mr. Shaik's payments to his friend was they were ''to influence Mr. Zuma to act in conflict with his constitutional duties.'' Last May, a ruling of South Africa's highest court said that Mr. Shaik had ''bribed'' Mr. Zuma and that Mr. Zuma ''did as a matter of fact promote Mr. Shaik's interests.''"9-Apr-09,"AFRICA (98%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (93%); GHANA (93%); LIBERIA (93%); MOZAMBIQUE (92%); SUDAN (92%); SOMALIA (92%); ZIMBABWE (92%); RWANDA (79%); ETHIOPIA (79%); UNITED STATES (79%)","For more than a decade, much of Africa has been moving forward. Economic growth is rising, poverty is falling and democratic governance is spreading. But the global financial crisis threatens to undo this progress by reducing investment, exports and aid just as they should be expanding to build on these successes. While international attention has been understandably focused on events in Darfur, Somalia and Zimbabwe, countries across the continent including Ghana, Tanzania, Mozambique and Liberia have been quietly turning around. Economic growth rates regularly exceed 5 percent in many nations. Since 2000, 34 million more African children are in school. More than 2 million Africans are on lifesaving HIV/AIDS medicines. Malaria deaths have been halved in Rwanda and Ethiopia, and the disease has been virtually eradicated in Zanzibar. Poverty rates are falling fast, from 58 to 51 percent across the continent in just six years, according to the World Bank. The key to this progress is stronger African leadership and more accountable governance. Today, more than 20 African countries are democracies, up from just three in the 1980s; they have competitive elections and improved human rights, and their news media are much freer. These efforts have been supported by increasingly effective development assistance from the United States and other partners. Consider what has happened in my country, Liberia. After 14 years of devastating war, we faced enormous challenges but had precious few resources. Our democratically elected government has worked with international partners and a growing number of private investors to turn things around. In the past three years, we have doubled primary school enrollment nationwide, refurbished hundreds of health facilities, and begun rebuilding roads and generators. We have taken steps to root out corruption and remove unscrupulous officials. Growth has exceeded 8 percent per year. And, most critical, we are at peace. We are restoring our once-vibrant nation, and the crucial component -- hope -- has already been revived. Without international support, we would not have made this progress and would be at much greater risk of returning to war. The economic crisis threatens the progress in my country and elsewhere on our continent. An estimated $50 billion in income could be lost in Africa during the next two years. Declining remittances, trade flows and investment could undermine new businesses, throw millions out of work, and increase tensions and instability. The crisis -- which Africa did nothing to cause -- demands a strong response. African nations must do their part by continuing to address corruption, eliminate red tape and reduce obstacles to private-sector growth. But just as industrialized countries need a stimulus, African economies need a boost to keep their progress on track. The Group of 20 meeting last week produced a helpful first step. Going forward, five additional steps are critical. First, the G-20 pledge to provide the International Monetary Fund with new resources must be fulfilled, and the IMF needs to get those resources to countries quickly and without onerous conditions. Second, the World Bank and the African Development Bank must better leverage their resources; aggressively front-load support; and better target growth, jobs and safety-net programs. The International Finance Corp., the World Bank's private-sector affiliate, must be especially creative in keeping private investment on track. Third, bilateral partners must build on their promises to increase aid and make it more effective by reducing bureaucratic delays, speeding disbursements and better aligning programs with African priorities. Fourth, export credit agencies must use their resources to attack risk and other barriers to trade finance, such as liquidity issues. Fifth, all countries must resist protectionist pressures so that trade can  be the critical engine for restoring global growth. The citizens and leaders of donor nations should recognize how important their assistance has been to the new leadership in Africa and how appreciative most Africans are for this partnership. Critics say that African economies are shrinking, that poverty is rising and that failing aid is the culprit. But this argument is at least a decade out of date. Africa's turnaround is real, the evidence indisputable. Africans themselves have been the key to this reversal, but more effective aid has played an important role. Reducing aid would slow private-sector growth, stall poverty reduction, and undermine peace and stability in countries that are struggling to become part of the global economy. It would be a cruel irony if, just as Africa began to succeed, its prospects were cut short by a crisis beyond its control. Strong action by African governments and robust support from the international community can keep Africa's recovery on track. Both should continue to do their part.

She followed that with ''I Didn't Do It for You: How the World Betrayed a Small African Nation,'' which told how an Eritrean rebel movement, ignored by the West, defeated a much stronger Ethiopian Army, then transmuted into an autocratic and bankrupt state. In ''It's Our Turn to Eat: The Story of a Kenyan Whistle-Blower,'' her third book, Wrong's subject is John Githongo, a newspaper journalist who became Kenya's first anticorruption czar. Two years later, he tendered his resignation and fled the country after unearthing evidence of graft at the highest levels of government. Githongo, an old friend of Wrong's, took refuge at her London flat and hid there for weeks while the press corps, along with Kenyan secret agents, searched the city for him in vain. Githongo's sojourn with Wrong was the genesis of a fast-paced political thriller -- with echoes of Graham Greene and John le Carre. Wrong's story begins on Dec. 30, 2002, with the inauguration of Mwai Kibaki, the country's first democratically elected president. Tens of thousands of jubilant Kenyans gather in a Nairobi park to witness Kibaki's swearing-in, and to hurl stones at the limousine spiriting away the former president, Daniel arap Moi, who had ruled the country as a one-party state for 24 years. (Moi surprised everybody by stepping down gracefully and retiring to his farm in the Kenyan highlands.) Under Moi, the country developed two identities: an island of political stability with a thriving tourism industry, and a kleptocracy run by a dictator whose motto, many Kenyans joked, was ''L'etat c'est Moi.'' (As Newsweek's Nairobi bureau chief in the '90s, I was twice threatened with expulsion after writing articles about corruption and repression in Moi's Kenya.) A classic Big Man, he plastered his image on bank notes, ordered his portrait hung in offices and shops, enriched tribal cronies and alledgedly stashed billions of dollars in his overseas bank accounts. Meanwhile, the country stagnated. At independence in 1963, Kenya's average per capita income equaled that of Malaysia; about 40 years later, Malaysia's was 10 times as high. As the agent of his country's redemption, however, Kibaki was hardly an inspiring figure. The first African graduate of the London School of Economics and a man who had often been described as ''brilliant'' by his peers, Kibaki in recent years had become, Wrong writes, ''a man with a reputation for soft living and hard drinking. . . . Like the latter-day Ronald Reagan in the grips of early Alzheimer's, he came across as an urbane, delightfully charming old duffer, but not a man anybody would want running the country.'' He was also a member of the Kikuyu tribe, the country's largest, who had benefited from patronage, land giveaways and other perks under the country's founding president, Jomo Kenyatta, but who had been marginalized by Moi, a member of the rival Kalenjin tribe. Soon enough, Kibaki stocked his cabinet with fellow Kikuyus -- known as ''the Mount Kenya Mafia'' -- who were eager to enjoy the spoils of power after years in the wilderness. Like the Kalenjins who preceded them, the newly ascendant Kikuyus were driven by a crudely avaricious philosophy: ''It's our turn to eat.'' Enter Githongo, an energetic and principled bear of a man with a nose for sniffing out graft, sharpened by years spent as a muckraking reporter and an investigator for Transparency International, the Berlin-based watchdog group. His father was a successful accountant who ran afoul of Moi's Kalenjin-dominated government and moved his family to London when Githongo was a boy; his mother was a fiercely religious woman who brought him under the tutelage of the Roman Catholic movement Opus Dei. Both parents honed a skepticism of politicians and power and helped him to transcend tribal allegiances. Recruited to head the new Kenyan anticorruption authority by Kibaki's inner circle, Githongo came to the job as an admirer of the new president, and for the first few months, he was somewhat star-struck by his proximity to power. But that changed as Githongo, through a network of informants, uncovered an elaborate fraud, set up by Kibaki's associates, to siphon hundreds of millions of dollars out of the Kenyan treasury through inflated no-bid contracts to a phantom corporation called the Anglo Leasing and Finance Company. After repeatedly being told to back off by Kibaki's inner circle, he turned whistle-blower. In one nail-biter of a scene, Githongo surreptitiously wore a recording device while colleagues discussed the details of the Anglo Leasing scheme -- only to have it malfunction and begin playing back their incriminating conversation. Wrong provides a damning account of the role played by the major donors to Kenya, including the World Bank and Britain's Department for International Development, whose top officials reacted with indifference after Githongo came forward with his evidence. Kenya's impressive economic expansion under Kibaki and its loyal support for the war on terror contributed to their reluctance to challenge the status quo. (Wrong points out that the 6 percent annual growth rate did little to improve the lot of Kenya's impoverished masses.) So did the officials' cozy relationships to the country's political elite. The World Bank's representative rented a villa from Kibaki in the plush Muthaiga neighborhood, a conflict of interest that went unremarked on by the organization's own auditing team. As Stephen Brown, associate professor of political studies at the University of Ottawa, tells Wrong, ''the donors' primary concern appeared to be the avoidance of any path that could lead to a breakdown of the political and economic order. . . . Donors actually forestalled fundamental change.'' Wrong's book has its shortcomings. I could have used more detail about the inner workings of the Anglo Leasing scheme, which remains frustratingly amorphous. Wrong never gets to the bottom of Kibaki's role in the scam: was he an eager participant, or a stroke-incapacitated bystander who followed the path of least resistance? And the cabal surrounding the president could also have been fleshed out more. They come across as an interchangeably sinister group of thieves. But these minor weaknesses pale before the sureness of Wrong's pacing, the depth of her reporting. She offers incisive discourses on Kikuyu history, the international development world, the language of Nairobi's cosmopolitan youth -- and her portrait of a courageous, conflicted protagonist. Githongo is an ordinary man thrust into an extraordinary situation, and forced to make excruciating moral choices. The upshot of Githongo's revelations was dispiriting. A few token officials lost their jobs, Kibaki was let off the hook and then it was back to business as usual. ''It's Our Turn to Eat'' ends with Kibaki's blatant attempt to steal the presidential election of December 2007 from the challenger, Raila Odinga, an opposition leader from the Luo tribe -- and the tragic denouement that Githongo had feared. Pent-up tribal resentments, exacerbated by a long tradition of graft, exploded when Kibaki had himself sworn in with unseemly haste and rejected calls for a new vote or negotiations with his opponent. The fraud set off a wave of ethnic killings and displacements, ruined many businesses and sent Western tourists scurrying. ''Five years of economic recovery were sabotaged in a matter of weeks,'' Wrong observes. Odinga was eventually installed as prime minister, and Kenya staggered back to its feet. Githongo remained fearful of retribution from the officials whose mischief he had exposed. Wrong's gripping, thoughtful book stands as both a tribute to Githongo's courage and a cautionary tale about the dangers of challenging a thoroughly corrupted system."20-Jul-09,EQUATORIAL GUINEA (98%); UNITED STATES (94%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%); AFRICA (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (55%),"To the Editor: Re ''Oil Corruption in Equatorial Guinea'' (Green Inc. blog, New York Times on the Web, July 9): As the ambassador to the United States for the people of Equatorial Guinea, I found both the Human Rights Watch report on Equatorial Guinea and your coverage disappointing. While my government is keenly aware of the lasting effect the mistakes made by our past leaders have had on our country, people and global reputation, the real news story is that we are working to build a better future and making significant progress each day. With technical assistance from the United States, European Union and World Bank, Equatorial Guinea has invested billions of dollars in recent years to improve our national infrastructure; to increase the quality and accessibility of our social services, education and health care systems for our people; and to defend the human rights of every Equatorial Guinea citizen. We have built state-of-the-art hospitals and schools; we are modernizing our textbooks; our police force and military are receiving extensive human rights training; and Equatorial Guinea is now one of the most successful countries in sub-Saharan Africa in the fight against malaria. Sensationalized reports like the one published by Human Rights Watch may be the unavoidable price of past mistakes, but I believe your readers, like my fellow countrymen, are more interested in the future of Equatorial Guinea than its past.

But behind these efforts to assess the voluminous evidence on African governance -- a catchall phrase that includes measures like corruption, vaccine coverage, crime rates and armed conflict -- lies a dispute between a Harvard political scientist, Robert Rotberg, and a wealthy Sudanese-born philanthropist, Mo Ibrahim, who used to finance his research. For the past two years, Professor Rotberg, the head of a program on conflict resolution at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, and Mr. Ibrahim, who leads his own foundation, collaborated to produce the Ibrahim Index of African Governance. But they parted ways over who should have final say. Last week, Professor Rotberg and his colleague, Rachel M. Gisselquist, released their Index of African Governance. Their work is now supported by the Boston-based World Peace Foundation, which Professor Rotberg leads. In an interview after the indexes were released, Mr. Ibrahim said decisions about the Ibrahim index were always meant to shift to the African researchers and institutions that his foundation's board had increasingly brought into the process -- a shift he said Professor Rotberg had resisted. ''Why should an American gentleman sitting in Boston have editorial control?'' Mr. Ibrahim asked. ''That is unacceptable.'' Professor Rotberg saw the dispute differently. He said he and Ms. Gisselquist had invented the index and wanted to retain authority over it. ''The issue is academic freedom versus foundation control,'' he said in a telephone interview on Monday. The two rival ratings count 9 out of 10 of the same countries among the best and worst governed, though not in the same order. Among the best governed, both name Mauritius, Seychelles, Cape Verde, Botswana, Tunisia, Ghana, Namibia, South Africa and Sao Tome and Principe. The Rotberg index also includes Algeria in the top 10, while the Ibrahim index counts Lesotho. Among the worst performers, both count Guinea, Zimbabwe, Eritrea, Central African Republic, Ivory Coast, Congo, Chad, Sudan and Somalia. For the Rotberg index, Angola made the bottom 10, while the Ibrahim index included Equatorial Guinea. They had more substantive differences over rankings for nations in the middle. For example, the Rotberg index ranked Malawi, a small, impoverished southern African nation, 14th, while the Ibrahim index put it 25th. Daniel Kaufmann, a Brookings Institution expert on corruption who is advising the Ibrahim Foundation, said the effort to make the index an African assessment of African governance could add to its influence on a continent where there is still suspicion of Western research. ''It will be harder to reject because of the Africanization,'' said Mr. Kaufmann, who was formerly at the World Bank Institute, where he shaped its global governance ratings. The Ibrahim Foundation has placed full-page advertisements in newspapers in 45 African countries describing its findings in local languages, an attempt to inform a broader public and to encourage civic groups to take advantage of the trove of information on its Web site. Advisers on the Ibrahim index say it relies on more recent data -- from 2008, as well as 2007 -- and tracks a broader array of information, including assessments by experts, than does the Rotberg index. Professor Rotberg said empirical data comparable across countries -- the main basis for his and Ms. Gisselquist's rankings -- were generally not available for the previous year. That is why they used 2007 data for the 2009 index. Both indexes offer elaborate and detailed breakdowns of dozens of indicators. Some who have researched similar issues but are not involved in either of the new indexes, like Hennie van Vuuren, in the Cape Town office of the Institute for Security Studies, said the split that led to two indexes was unfortunate. ''It would make much more sense to pool resources and have a methodologically strong index -- an instrument that African governments and civil society groups can trust to be a mirror of the state of governance on the African continent,'' he said."25-Oct-09,KENYA (97%); GHANA (94%); AFRICA (94%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%),"Accompanying the fanfare of President Obama's visit to Ghana in July was a chorus of well-founded praise for that country's functioning democracy. The U.S. president pointed to his host country as a shining example, while warning other nations on the continent that ""Africa doesn't need strongmen, it needs strong institutions.""  Political pundits and the media reinforced Obama's message, holding up Ghana as Africa's success story. Not so long ago, Ghana shared the limelight with Kenya, the country of Obama's paternal past. But the vote-tampering and widespread ethnic violence that marred the 2007 Kenyan elections left observers shaking their heads, wondering how the idyll of East Africa could have gone so wrong, so quickly. A well-functioning, multiparty government buoyed by an impressive 6 percent annual growth rate had made for a potent combination in the post-colonial dream world. The blurring of fantasy and reality, however, was laid bare in the smoldering rubble of election violence that left some 1,500 Kenyans dead and at least 300,000 internally displaced. Journalist Michela Wrong provides a very important and illuminating account of Kenya's present-day political and economic morass. On one level, ""It's Our Turn to Eat"" reads like a John le Carr novel as it traces the cloak-and-dagger maneuverings of Kenya's political bosses, and the heroic but futile attempts of John Githongo -- the government's internal, anti-corruption watchdog, and the protagonist of Wrong's account -- to stymie them. On a deeper and much richer level, the book is an analysis of how and why Kenya descended into political violence more than a year and a half ago. For Wrong, the insidious bedfellows of corruption and tribalism inhabit nearly every sphere of Kenyan existence. At the upper echelons of government, members of parliament connived to defraud the country of some $750 million through the notorious Anglo-Leasing scheme; at the lower levels of society, the ordinary Kenyan doles out on average 16 bribes a month to government agents simply to get by. These factors, as Wrong points out, have been present in Kenya since the inauguration of the country's first independent government in 1963, despite the rather rosy and misplaced image that characterized the nation, at least in the Western media, for decades. First, under the leadership of Jomo Kenyatta, the Kikuyu, Kenya's ethnic majority,  benefited disproportionately from the state's spoils. Kenyatta surrounded himself with a coterie of loyal ethnic supporters who systematically excluded non-Kikuyu from participating in their quest for power and ill-gotten wealth. Subsequently, when Daniel T. arap Moi took power in 1978, the new president continued with the tribally based corruption. Only this time, Moi, who came from the ethnic-minority Kalenjin of western Kenya, redirected the flow of wealth and power to his tribal base of supporters. For the Kalenjin and other closely related tribes, it was their turn to eat. It was Githongo -- a Western-educated, physically imposing and exceedingly shrewd man -- who was to herald the literal and symbolic end to this vicious cycle of corruption and ethnic favoritism. When Mwai Kibaki, a Kikuyu, took presidential power in 2002, he declared his election a mandate for reform and appointed the young Githongo, also a Kikuyu, to root out the old bogies that had undermined Kenya's progress. It wasn't long, though, before Githongo's starry eyes cleared, only to find his revered mentor, Kibaki, knee-deep in the corruption game, with a supporting cast of legislators aiding and abetting theft from the state's coffers. With much drama, Githongo eventually fled Kenya, taking with him piles of documents and secretly taped conversations. He landed on the London doorstep of Wrong, an old acquaintance. Given this personal connection, Wrong is notably self-aware of her position as both author and partial subject of her own book. Indeed, her  personal involvement scarcely compromises her excellent analysis of Kenya's twin evils; rather, she deftly points to the fact that corruption and tribalism are not endemic just to Africa, but inhabit the contemporary, worldwide landscape, and that complicity reaches to all corners of the globe as well. If the old-boy system is not an African artifact, and if undemocratic processes have no boundaries -- many a Kenyan will snicker at the mention of a hanging chad -- how then does Wrong make sense of the localized events in Kenya? By ""probing the roots of a dysfunctional African nation"" and its British colonial legacy, as well as Kenya's more recent entanglements with the likes of the World Bank and Britain's Department for International Development, Wrong takes a decidedly Paul Wolfowitz-like stand. That is, political systems are at the heart of the problem and must be reformed if there is any hope for the alleviation of poverty -- and not just in Kenya. It's difficult to argue against Wrong on this point, though the roots and solutions to Kenya's problems are far more embedded in the country's past than she suggests. Colonial Kenya -- with its white tribe of settlers and administrators, economic monopolies and perpetuation of African tribalism, and a governor who ruled with highly centralized powers and a posse of loyal underlings to support him -- bears an uncanny resemblance to the country today. Moreover, while Wrong praises Britain's former  highest-ranking ambassador to Kenya, High Commissioner Edward Clay, and his anti-corruption stance, she fails to mention that, while Clay was making his strongest denunciations of corruption, the full impact of Britain's colonial violence and coverups was finally being disclosed in Kenya. Britain's colonial legacy has undermined its moral authority and continues to influence processes in Kenya, no matter how complicit Africans have been in perpetuating corruption and tribalism. The historical phenomenon of colonialism and its long-term impact vary across the continent, making the trajectory of a former settler colony such as Kenya distinct from that of Ghana, and many other African nations, for that matter. If strongmen are to be eliminated and institutions reformed -- as both Obama and Wrong urge -- then the historical differences among various African countries, and the ways in which these differences inform and shape present-day governing structures and cultures, must be thoroughly understood.

With growth rates well above the average for sub-Saharan Africa, little corruption, good roads and a reliable power supply, Rwanda dazzled those looking for a ''model'' African development narrative. So we should be very wary of mistaking the surface glitter of Rwanda today -- the tall buildings, clean streets and Internet cafes --  as signs that all is well. Ethnic divisions and political authoritarianism have not disappeared from Rwanda, nor has a tendency to use violence to resolve differences dissipated.

That made me think about Liberian children who still have to do their homework while squatting under street lamps, because they have no electricity at home. That may seem an odd connection, but after you've had a visit from the formidable Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, almost anything can make you think of Liberia. Johnson-Sirleaf is the unsentimental, relentless president of that impoverished West African nation. She was elected in 2005, as Liberia was emerging from years of vicious civil war, and she recently came to Washington to deliver a progress report and ask for continued support. To get a sense of the challenge she faced when she took over, consider this: Eighty-five percent. That was Johnson-Sirleaf's reply when I asked about unemployment in her capital of Monrovia. No, I said, assuming she had misheard; I said unemployment rate, not employment rate. ""Eighty-five percent,"" she insisted grimly. But, she said, thanks to foreign investment, improvements in infrastructure and efforts to combat crime and corruption, it has decreased to 50 percent today. Imagine celebrating an employment rate of 50 percent. What had really stuck with me from the president's last visit, in 2006, was the image of children gathering on street corners to do their homework. ""We have a city that's dark,"" she had said, setting electrification as one of her first goals. And today? The president reported, with little satisfaction, that 18 percent of the capital now is wired -- this despite a partnership of the World Bank, the International Finance Corp., the United States and Norway aimed at bringing electricity to the city. What's taking so long? During the war, every single wire had been taken down and sold or destroyed, she said. The World Bank contracting process grinds slowly. But the main factor: The solution to the problem is a planned hydroelectric plant that will cost $300 million, and $300 million is a lot of money. Unless you're in the American cotton business. As that Post editorial said, the U.S. government has been paying cotton growers more than $3 billion per year since 1991, with most of the largess going (as the Environmental Working Group has demonstrated) to big agribusiness in the South. The subsidies are so out of whack that the World Trade Organization ruled them an unfair trading practice -- and rather than reform, the United States is now forking over another $147 million per year to Brazilian cotton farmers, who lodged the complaint. Obvious solution: Turn off the spigot to Balmoral Farming Partnership of Louisiana ($18 million in cotton subsidies from 1995 to 2009, according to EWG), Gila River Farms of Arizona ($16 million) and the other welfare queens of cotton for just one month -- one month! -- and let Liberia have its hydroelectric plant. Monrovia schoolchildren could do their homework. As adults, they might earn more than the average $500 per year that their parents earn. West Africa would be stabler. America would be more secure. And so on. Except, of course, that any interruption in cotton subsidies would be unacceptable to the fiscal hypocrites of Louisiana, Arizona and other agribusiness states who would howl at a reduction in subsidies and, no doubt, at any increase in foreign aid. I'm  thinking here of statesmen like Sen. David Vitter, Louisiana Republican, running for reelection with ""Fighting Wasteful Government Spending"" listed as his top issue -- but who merrily joined eight other Republican fiscal hypocrites in a letter to President Obama in March opposing any cuts to the ""farm safety net."" (""While we agree that fiscal restraint is necessary and spending in the Federal budget should be reduced, doing so in this manner places a disproportionate burden on the backs of farmers, ranchers and rural communities and fails to recognize the recent sacrifices these constituencies made . . . . "") Johnson-Sirleaf, now 71, recently announced that she will run for reelection next year. Liberia has more foreign investment for the size of its economy than any other country. Its six years of peace are a major achievement. Young men who knew nothing but guns are being gradually reintegrated into society. But, she says, with a sigh, ""It's all taking a little bit longer than we had anticipated."" fredhiatt@washpost.com"24-Oct-10,LIBERIA (94%); AFRICA (93%),"Daniel Bergner is a contributing writer. He is the author of ''In the Land of Magic Soldiers: A Story of White and Black in West Africa.''  ''Tell them to stop leaning on the fence!'' Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, president of Liberia and the first woman ever elected head of state on the continent of Africa, ordered the leader of her security team. We were driving along one of the scarce paved avenues in her nation's capital, Monrovia. With her convoy rode United Nations gunmen, part of a peacekeeping force of 10,000 charged with preventing a conflagration in the aftermath of 14 years of horrific civil war. The fighting ended in 2003, but outside the windows of Sirleaf's S.U.V., the skeletons of abandoned buildings and the cries, at once thrilled and desperate, of the onlookers along the president's route were signs of the country's position near last on any list of how well the world's nations are functioning. Yet Sirleaf's attention narrowed on a bit of black iron railing and a cluster of leaning teenage boys. The simple, wilting fence -- a rare adornment on the avenue's median and a hint of order in a city still reeling from war's anarchy -- looked close to collapse. The 71-year-old president's focus, always exacting, grew fierce. ''Tell them to stop,'' she repeated in her scratchy voice. She meant for her security man to radio back to someone else in the convoy to scold and scatter the boys. It seemed she would have rather done the scolding herself. Below her purple, geometrically patterned head wrap of African cloth, severe grandmotherly disapproval seized her face. ''They will break that fence!'' Sirleaf, who beat a Liberian soccer star, George Weah, to win the presidency in 2005, and who has announced that she will run for a second term next year, is seen as a figure of profound hope for Africa by many in the West and as a savior by some Liberians, partly because she is so stern, her resolve palpable and her standards high, and partly because she is a woman. Her rivals in the next election are likely to include Weah again, as well as an ex-rebel commander named Prince Yormie Johnson, who slaughtered one of the country's recent presidents. Sirleaf would agree with the assessments of why she should keep running Liberia. She takes pride in working long into every night and in standing above -- and, as much as possible, standing up to -- the country's legendary and crippling government corruption. She credits some of her strength to having survived a violently abusive husband. And she doesn't hesitate in declaring that women make better leaders. Women lead more than a quarter of her ministries. If she could find enough qualified females, she told me this summer, and if she could make changes across the board without upsetting political balances, she would appoint women to lead every one of them. ''Women are more committed,'' she said, as we rode past one of the Monrovia neighborhoods that has recently regained public electricity, after Sirleaf's administration started mending the capital's electrical grid that was damaged by the war's ravages. The rest of the city relies on private generators, with most of the cratered streets pitch dark at night. ''Women work harder,'' she continued. ''And women are more honest; they have less reasons to be corrupt. They don't have so many diversions. Men have more than one wife; they have their concubines. We have polygamy here, not polyandry.'' She laughed quietly at her pointed logic. Sirleaf's precise, pointed manner has helped make her a darling in the world of international aid, a reason for believing that the rescue of Africa, with all its misrule, remains possible. Right before she tried to save the keeling fence, she sat in a booth at a Monrovia radio station. She educated listeners about the $4.6 billion worth of debt relief her government had just gained through the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Her administration won the reprieve by designing and starting to implement an auspicious set of fiscal reforms. The relief was, she said to me, perhaps the most important achievement of her presidency so far. And certainly her skilled and perpetual soliciting of international support -- including the forgiven billions; a $20-million-plus loan program for Liberian businesses set up by the African-American entrepreneur and Black Entertainment Television founder Robert Johnson; and $500,000 newly awarded by an American sorority to help Liberia's market women -- has been a centerpiece of her leadership. ''Dey pour penalty on top,'' she explained from the ramshackle radio station, as the broadcast reached much of the country of around three and a half million; its land -- about the size of Ohio -- runs from West African beach to jungle interior. Speaking in Liberia's patois to make sure she was understood, she lectured on the consequence of the debt that had accumulated over decades and dwarfed the nation's current $350 million annual budget: ''We could no borrow a penny!'' She talked about the more modest loans -- with better terms -- she will seek and can well hope to get, now that Liberia has been granted this fresh start and vote of confidence. It was, to an extent, a typical political performance, a president telling her people how wisely she served them. And I couldn't help wondering whether the new loans Sirleaf anticipated, with their generous deferrals of payment, would only result later in another round of impossible amounts owed, another round of forgiveness sought from the world's powerful nations, another confirmation of Liberia's -- and Africa's -- mismanagement and dispiriting dependence on international charity. Yet Sirleaf's no-nonsense tone hushed misgivings. She has a master's degree in public administration from Harvard and a reputation for fiscal vigilance dating back to her rise through Liberia's financial ministry in the late 1960s and '70s. By the '80s, her stances against dictatorial repression and official plundering earned her a sentence to prison and years in exile. ''We see her as one of us,'' Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to Liberia, said, describing Sirleaf's appeal to Western diplomats and dispensers of aid. Thomas-Greenfield, an African-American who originally came to Liberia as a doctoral student studying rice production in the late '70s, and who heard about Sirleaf then, stressed the importance of Sirleaf's having worked, while in exile, as a senior U.N. official and as a Citicorp vice president in Nairobi in charge of the bank's African operation. Sirleaf, she said, straddles worlds with agility. The president is able to address Liberian constituents in ways that disarm distrust of her ''book'' learning; she has managed to work with old political enemies now in the Liberian Legislature; and, the ambassador said: ''She speaks our language. We know, with her, that good governance and corruption are being taken seriously. She's tremendously well liked. We know our dollars are being well spent. And then there's the fact that she's a woman -- the first. We don't want to see her fail.'' Thomas-Greenfield described Sirleaf's lobbying style: ''I wouldn't say that she's charismatic. It's more that she's very serious, very focused. Down to the most minute detail.'' This was easy to imagine, given Sirleaf's attention to the fence amid all else that is awry after a war that unleashed widespread rape and the conscription of child soldiers, perhaps as young as 7, some of them forced to kill their own parents. ''She's bringing this country out of darkness into light,'' Thomas-Greenfield said. Not all Liberians, though, are so enthusiastic. Plenty do recognize Sirleaf's favored status among international benefactors -- and Liberians tend to be keenly aware of the importance of foreign benevolence. But Sirleaf has been in office four years now, and there is a level of impatience with her leadership that I didn't hear on my last trip to Liberia a year ago. She may still be beloved by some as ''Mama Ellen,'' and she may be likely to win another term, yet many Liberians are resentful that they continue to count on packs of vigilantes to protect them, because the police -- whose starting salary is just over $4.50 a day -- are ineffectual and relentlessly corrupt and the courts too slow to matter. Bureaucrats high and low go on requiring bribes and siphoning government funds in ways that have long robbed the country of infrastructure and debilitated the economy. ''We can't stamp it out, not yet,'' Sirleaf said to me, clenching her fists in frustration over the country's bone-deep corruption. She spoke of being torn between firing every transgressing official and keeping enough ministers and staff members at their desks so the government can go on operating, no matter how badly it is compromised. And meanwhile, unemployment in the country, whose population shifted heavily to Monrovia during the war, stands as high as 85 percent by some estimates. Instilling faith that Liberia's economic wasteland can be redeemed, however gradually, may be the only way to ensure long-lasting peace, especially with the U.N. troops expected to start pulling out after next year's elections. Over the radio, Sirleaf put the emphasis on gradually. ''I beg you I no magician,'' she said, letting a plea seep into her lecture. ''I can't just wave a magic wand.'' The president has a light, red-brown complexion; skin that serves as a particular reminder of one cause of her country's implosion. Liberia was founded -- as a coastal settlement in 1822 and as Africa's first republic in 1847 -- by free American blacks, and the settler class that developed did all it could to replicate the American society it had sailed away from. The men wore top hats and tails; the women, bonnets and bustles. The republic designed its flag after the Stars and Stripes of the United States, named its capital after the U.S. president James Monroe and subjugated the tribes within its borders in ways that sometimes resembled outright slavery. Not until 1980 did Liberia have its first indigenous ruler, Samuel Doe, an army sergeant whose coup can be understood as a surge of long-suppressed rage. He disemboweled the president, then executed 13 government ministers before a crowd of hundreds on Monrovia's beach. Today, the divide between the people Liberians refer to as ''native'' and those called ''Americo-Liberian'' still plagues the nation. And Sirleaf, whose complexion is lighter than just about any Liberian's, has pointed out frequently and emphatically that her color is misleading, that she actually has no Americo-Liberian blood whatsoever, that she does not belong to the racial elite whose greed and historic oppression is named by some as the origin of Liberia's brutal collapse. Sirleaf's complexion and her privileged childhood make for a complicated story. She is the granddaughter, on her father's side, of a prominent rural chief and one of his eight wives, and on her mother's of a market woman and a German trader who was soon banished from Liberia, along with all Germans, as Liberia proclaimed its loyalty to the United States at the start of World War I. It's the German lineage that lightens Sirleaf's skin, but the access to education and power that elevated her girlhood stems from a Liberian tradition known as the ward system. Since the early years of the republic, the poor have often sent their sons and daughters to live with the better off, to serve them in return for the promise of schooling and the hope of other opportunities. In this way, indigenous children have cleaned the homes and cooked the meals of the settler class. They have belonged, more or less, to their warder families, as something between slaves and foster children; they have generally been given their warders' last names. Over generations, the tradition hasn't eradicated distinctions of blood and status -- the schooling provided can be meager and the chance for advancement minimal -- but it has blurred the lines. And in Sirleaf's case, it eliminated them. Sent from his remote village to Monrovia as a ward, her father was treated relatively well, in Sirleaf's telling, because his father, as a chief, had become acquainted with the nation's president. Her father apprenticed himself to a lawyer, then practiced as a lawyer and, before a stroke paralyzed him in his 40s, became the first indigenous man elected to Liberia's House of Representatives. Sirleaf's mother, after a cruel stint with her first settler family, was claimed by another warder and raised generously -- in part because of her nearly white skin. Sirleaf's own rise started with sheer girlhood determination. She reminisced with me about her preparations for a fistfight with a neighbor girl over a stolen plum. When she was about 9, Sirleaf asked her grandmother to arrange for her to be given ''a potion, fighting medicine.'' The underside of her left wrist was sliced repeatedly with a razor blade, the potion spread into the wounds. She showed me the still-visible dark scars, as a sign of how badly she wanted to win that battle. Her older sister, Jennie Bernard, recalled Sirleaf's drive and success in school, yet at 17 Sirleaf detoured abruptly from ambition when she fell in love with a man seven years older who had just returned home after going to college in the United States. He married her and took her along when he went to the University of Wisconsin at Madison for a master's degree in agriculture. She enrolled as an undergraduate at a local business college and, when they were strapped for cash, worked in a drugstore. Jealous of her time and ashamed of her menial job, her husband, who has since died, lurched into the store one evening, she recounted, ripped a broom from her hands and screamed that she should be home. He drank and grew more and more aggressive in Madison and when they moved back to Monrovia. At one point, he struck her head with the butt of a gun. Her sister remembered that he once walked into Sirleaf's office, during her early years at the ministry of finance, and slapped her for working late. In reflective tones, Sirleaf spoke with me about his love for her and his possessiveness. She wrested herself from the marriage at last, she said, after he leveled a gun at her in front of one of their four young sons. The boy grabbed a can of mosquito repellent and tried to spray it in his father's eyes to wake him from his blind rage. Sirleaf's marriage seems to have hardened a resilience she always possessed and to have steeled her against the violence that was coming to her country. By the time Samuel Doe carried out his murderous coup in 1980, she had earned her master's at Harvard with the help of an American economics professor advising the government in Monrovia, and she was Liberia's minister of finance. In the overthrow, she had reason to expect to be killed, by Doe himself or by the roving throngs taking revenge on well-off Monrovians. Yet she managed to survive, by her account, through a combination of composure and a knowledge of financial matters that Doe desperately needed. At the dictator's request, she ran one of the nation's largest banks; then, after rebuking the regime for greed and corruption, she fled into exile. When Doe sought the legitimacy of being elected, she risked returning to Liberia and taking an acerbic part in the campaign against him. She was locked up and sentenced to 10 years, then was let go almost immediately, partly because of pressure from the Reagan administration, which supported Doe as a cold-war ally. The experience didn't stop her from defying Doe. Soon she was taken captive again by his men, threatened with rape and told she would be buried alive. Released, she went back into exile. In 1989, while living in the United States, Sirleaf raised money for an insurgency against Doe led by Charles Taylor, who went on to stoke the country's all-consuming war, who claimed Liberia's presidency in a dubious election in 1997, who enriched himself immensely during his rule and who is now on trial, in a special court at the Hague, charged with crimes against humanity committed as he stirred war in neighboring Sierra Leone. Because of her early and enthusiastic backing for Taylor, the Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, charged with helping the nation to heal, recommended last year that she be barred from public office for 30 years. The proposal, which holds no legal power, seems to be viewed by Liberians and Westerners, and by Sirleaf herself, as almost precious. ''We were trying to bring down a dictator,'' Sirleaf said to me, with more impatience than apology. We were creeping along a mud road just outside Monrovia, where the city gives way swiftly to villages and bush. She was going to a ceremony for a new maritime-training center that, she hoped, would help Liberians land jobs as deckhands on foreign ships. As her convoy approached a village, a dusty man beat a conga drum that had a badly torn head, and an impromptu, bedraggled choir sang in tribute. Ordering the convoy to stop, Sirleaf directed one of her staff workers to give the village leader about $20 in cash. It was Sirleaf's money. She did this regularly. She glanced at me, chagrined by the impropriety in the gesture -- but, again, hardly apologetic. There was no government system of support for the poor, she said tersely; this, for now, was the best she could do. One reality she contends with -- the nearness of her nation's explosive history -- may be best captured by the presidential candidacy of Prince Yormie Johnson, the rebel who, in 1990, after a split from Taylor, captured Doe. With a video camera recording the proceedings, Johnson drank beer and looked on while his henchmen sliced off the president's ears. The killing came later. The video is currently sold by peddlers in the capital's downtown. Johnson's run for president might be considered a macabre joke, except that in 2005 the people of his home region elected him to the Liberian Senate. ''It's Obama style!'' he proclaimed to me this summer, talking about the small contributions that were already accumulating in his presidential-campaign chest. With his round cheeks and whitening beard, Johnson looked something like a Liberian Santa Claus. He assured me that his lack of formal education would be an advantage in governing the country: ''Did Abraham Lincoln have a Ph.D.? My support is swelling daily!'' As I watched Sirleaf rigorously and tirelessly at work in her spare, hushed office, I was often struck by the distance she has put between herself and the violence of her own past: the violence inflicted privately upon her as a wife, the violence threatened against her as a public figure. The office sits on the top floor of a government building in which the electricity staggers now and then and the elevator buttons have long been broken. Given her status, Sirleaf works and lives frugally -- a brunch she and I shared at her house one Sunday was made up partly of leftovers set on the table in plastic containers. What she prizes instead of splendor is calm. In the conference rooms adjoining her office, the meetings I watched her run -- with angry widows of Taylor-era soldiers demanding benefits; with a quarreling auditor and minister -- were muted affairs. She listened with stoic patience to everyone, as though only in this way could she keep disgruntlement from leaking out onto the streets like lighter fluid. Sirleaf's mission is, above all, to distance her country as far from violence as she has delivered herself, and her success most likely depends, primarily, on the economy, on her ability to produce signs that decades defined by abject poverty and rampant plundering can be replaced by the hope of simple employment and lawful profit. Without such signs, there is little reason to think that frustration and fatalism won't combust again in the decades to come. So in addition to debt relief, some of Sirleaf's crucial achievements have been the renegotiations of unfavorable contracts with foreign corporations like ArcelorMittal, of Luxembourg, the largest steel company in the world, which plans to mine Liberian iron, and with the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, which has tapped the country's rubber trees for almost a century. Yet to spend time on Firestone's plantation among its thousands of tappers, who scrape at the trunks with barbed knives and scramble to collect their daily quota of latex in zinc buckets, is to confront how inconceivably far the Liberian economy has to go. If the tappers present enough latex at the weighing stations, they can earn $4.41 a day. It is very desirable job by Liberian standards. Liberia's natural resources just aren't in high-enough demand around the world to spur the economy and generate much public revenue. Firestone is providing the government with $4.7 million this year, Sirleaf estimated. To truly take advantage of its iron, rubber and timber, Liberia would have to manufacture things with them; it would have to export finished products rather than raw materials. And it can't; the country is all but preindustrial. The lone hope for Liberia's sudden transformation may lie in offshore petroleum. Oil is not iron or rubber. Sirleaf spoke of recent ocean finds -- not only off the coast of Ghana, but even closer by, in the waters of Sierra Leone and, in the most nascent way, off Liberia's own beaches -- as signs of arriving transfiguration. Imagining the boon to her country if, over the next few years, the intimations become bountiful wells, Sirleaf lost hold of the harsh realism that usually keeps her thoughts and words blade-sharp. I asked whether she worried that corruption would devour the benefits that oil could bring to Liberia, as had happened in Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea. Not, she replied, if a major company like Chevron winds up winning the rights to drill -- as it did, soon after my visit. She couldn't possibly have been unaware of Chevron's dark history along Nigeria's southern shoreline, but at that moment, while she envisioned the company pumping oil from her coast, such history seemed far from her mind. While we talked, British Petroleum's Deep Horizon well was spewing into the Gulf of Mexico, and I mentioned to Sirleaf that if such a disaster befell Liberia, her country would command a lot less attention than the United States when it came time to clean up. ''Let's find it first before we worry about the spilling,'' she said, realism and severity returning. ''Right now we're worried about feeding the people and giving them jobs. The environment -- we'll take care of it later.'' If by way of oil, or if by slower yet still miraculous economic metamorphoses, or if because Liberians are just too weary of war, stability takes root in her country, then one of Sirleaf's deepest ambitions might be realized: to improve the plight of women, who suffered inordinately throughout the years of fighting. Rape was endemic during the war, and, Sirleaf lamented, it infects the culture now. A new courtroom has been built; it is reserved for trying cases of sexual assault, an attempt to assure women that such crimes will be taken seriously and to dissuade them from settling with rapists informally -- sometimes, as happened in a case I followed during a visit several years ago, for as little as $2. But to step into the Women and Children Protection Unit in the Liberian police department's headquarters in Monrovia is to sense that even a determined female president may have trouble providing women with much in the way of safety. The dilapidated headquarters is a kind of vertical cave, blearily lighted where it is lighted at all. The place all but advertises the country's flimsy ability to enforce its laws, yet given her meager budget, Sirleaf said that before she considers renovating the building, she intends to construct living quarters for the police in rural areas, where it is hard to attract recruits and where enforcement is even flimsier than in the capital. The Women and Children Protection Unit, where rape victims are meant to report their assaults, sits at the end of a hall of cryptlike offices filled with men, some in uniform, some perhaps detectives in plainclothes, some criminals, some just loitering, spilling into the corridor. At the end of this menacing gantlet, in the Protection Unit, a female receptionist and a female sergeant wait at scarred wooden desks. But even here the men leach in; the headquarters is their domain, and it is easy to imagine that women would rather be paid minimally for their suffering than begin the search for justice in this place. A brighter expression of Sirleaf's goals lies along one of the capital's rutted dirt lanes. A Nike Foundation program trains Liberian women in their late teens and early 20s to work in offices or hotels. Sirleaf's lobbying persuaded the sporting-goods giant to choose Liberia as the pilot nation for the project, which will try to imbue 2,500 women around the country with vocational skills. Proudly, one of the young women led me on a tour through the training stations for the course on hotel hospitality. Wearing vibrant African fabrics, she led me past a hand-scrawled sign -- ''Mama Ellen Johnson Sirleaf we love you for what you are doing for the young girls of our nation'' -- and into the facsimile of a guest room where the students practiced making beds; into the bathroom where two girls in masks were practicing the scrubbing of toilets; out to a gazebo arranged as a mock restaurant, with a table fully set and a chalkboard announcing ''Chicken Liberian Style'' as the day's special. ''If I can provide my own money, men will not be able to carry on their violence,'' one student said hopefully, referring not to rape but to the range of commonplace assaults she and her fellow trainees might typically endure. And the stations were so orderly that it was easy to believe, at least briefly, that all the graduates would soon be employed -- menially, in many cases, but gainfully. All sorts of transformations appeared plausible in the mock restaurant with the paper napkins slipped daintily inside the glasses. And then reality reasserted itself. Where were the Liberian hotels to hire these students? The country has a handful of places that cater to visiting U.N. employees and the few foreign investors looking for resources to be reaped. But Liberian tourism is hardly a growth industry. ''I'm going to show you a beautiful spot,'' Sirleaf said to me one afternoon, as if to answer my doubts about the trainees' prospects, though I hadn't raised the dispiriting subject. Near the village whose drummer had beat at his torn conga drum, her convoy stopped at a wispy and graceful bridge stretching over a small river. A lush green island lay on the far side of the span, and a pair of ample, alluring houses stood perched over the water, one on either bank. The property belonged to a man she knew, she said. She saw it as the beginning of a future resort. The president of Liberia stood amid the luxuriant calm of that lovely dream."7-Nov-10,LIBERIA (94%); UNITED STATES (93%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%); AFRICA (79%),"Anyone who knows the situation in Liberia would take issue with Daniel Bergner's characterization of President Sirleaf as an ''uncompromising woman.'' Any leader of a country in a situation like Liberia's will have to compromise every day in every way with giant donors like the World Bank, the E.U. and the U.S. State Department, not to mention the competing interests and demands of a war-ravaged population and a political class that is constantly fighting over a very small plate of spoils. President Sirleaf has done a masterful job of presenting Liberia as a country on the move; this despite the continuing presence of 10,000 U.N. troops, an unemployment rate over 80 percent, a private sector controlled by foreigners and a mind-boggling set of dysfunctional social realities that range from corroding political corruption to completely broken health, education and social-welfare systems. In addition, the government has yet to issue its official position on the Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission's report of last year which called for the banning of President Sirleaf from political office for 30 years because of her involvement in the conflict and for the creation of war-crime tribunals (whose first customer would most likely be one of her main opponents in the 2011 election, the senator from Nimba County, Prince Johnson). It is disheartening to hear Sirleaf's optimism about the positive effects that potential oil discoveries would have for Liberia given the impact of the ''oil curse'' in other West African states. Liberia doesn't need oil; it needs a new set of ideas that Sirleaf and her clique are unlikely to provide. The real hope for Liberia lies with young Liberians now studying inthe United States and elsewhere who might be enticed to return home and try their hands at nation-building. President Sirleaf will very likely win a well-deserved second term, but she is still just a placeholder for the generation of Liberians who can really createan uncompromising space for the citizens of their fascinating but terribly ravaged country. MICHAEL KEATING Associate Director Center for Democracy and Development John W. McCormack Graduate School of Policy and Global Studies University of Massachusetts, Boston"31-May-11,EQUATORIAL GUINEA (97%); UNITED STATES (97%); AFRICA (96%); NORTHERN AFRICA (92%); MIDDLE EAST (92%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%); TURKMENISTAN (79%); LIBYA (79%),"MALABO, Equatorial Guinea -- While the United States has turned its back on some authoritarian rulers in North Africa and the Middle East, its attitude toward strategically placed autocrats in less restive corners of Africa is more ambiguous, and perhaps nowhere more so than in this oil-rich speck of a nation in the Gulf of Guinea. Officially and unofficially, Americans do business with one of the undisputed human rights global bad boys, Equatorial Guinea, Africa's fourth biggest oil exporter. Its widely criticized record on basic freedoms has offered little barrier to broad engagement by the United States, commercially or diplomatically. American oil companies have billions of dollars invested here. One American diplomat, using language that makes human rights advocates fume, praised the ''mellowing, benign leadership'' of the dictator in power for more than 30 years, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, in 2009 cables released by WikiLeaks. And a leading American military contractor with strong Pentagon ties has a multimillion-dollar contract to protect his shores and help train his forces. The contractor, Military Professional Resources Inc., or M.P.R.I., led by a top aide to former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, works on maritime security and human rights training for Mr. Obiang's police forces. But even with the training, the United Nations, human rights groups and local dissidents say torture by the nation's authorities remains systematic. And maritime security touches on the most sensitive aspects of personal defense for Mr. Obiang, especially in an island capital where coup attempts have come from the sea. Until March, President Bill Clinton's former special counsel, Lanny J. Davis, had a million-dollar-a-year contract to help Mr. Obiang with an image makeover. ''He feels very vulnerable, without any friends,'' Mr. Davis said in an interview late last year. Mr. Obiang's government could be considered a tough sell. Freedom House, the watchdog group, has ranked Equatorial Guinea among the nine most repressive ''Worst of the Worst'' nations in the world, along with Libya, Turkmenistan and Myanmar. It called the country's government ''a highly corrupt regime with one of the worst human rights records in Africa.'' Decades of repression and ''systematic'' torture, according to the United Nations, have created a culture of fear in this former Spanish colony of 670,000 people, Africa's only Spanish-speaking country. ''They don't even hide the torture instruments,'' said Manfred Nowak, until recently the United Nations' special rapporteur on torture. ''It was just on the table.'' Interviewed at the presidential palace here, Mr. Obiang, sub-Saharan Africa's longest-serving ruler, rejected such assertions. ''We don't have torture,'' he said, adding: ''International organizations have accused our police of mistreatment of prisoners. That's why I hired M.P.R.I., to train our police. And our police are acting appropriately.'' Mr. Nowak found otherwise. ''I'm deeply convinced it is a governmental policy,'' he said. ''They know exactly what is going on.'' Citizens who are audacious enough to talk about the political climate here joke behind closed doors about North Korea as a role model. Last month, opposition leaders were arrested for putting up a poster calling for a demonstration against Mr. Obiang, who overthrew his notoriously brutal uncle in a 1979 coup and won the last election here in November 2009 with more than 95 percent of the vote. Strolling in the wrong neighborhood lands you at the police station. A visit to Parliament's lone opposition member in his crumbling downtown walk-up is quickly known to the security services, bringing stern warnings from the information minister. The government publishes the only newspaper, and it is five months out of date at the leading hotel, a former torture center. ''Any policeman can arrest any citizen, at any time,'' said Placido Mico, a lawyer who is the only opposition deputy, and has been arrested numerous times. Torture is a ''current thing, current,'' Mr. Mico said, recalling his own beating in the presence of high officials late one night in 1992. Gonzalo Ndong Sima, a pharmacist in the center of town here, recounted his recent encounter with the police over a simple traffic mishap, saying, ''They beat me like an animal.'' Still, American officials have called for a far rosier vision of the country. The United States Embassy here, in 2009 cables, advised that it was ''time to abandon a moral narrative'' about Equatorial Guinea and dismissed reports of corruption that have been widely documented by the United States Senate and others. ''Things are clearly looking up,'' one cable concluded. The current American ambassador here defended Mr. Obiang's government against the statistics of the World Bank and human rights groups that show a huge gap between the country's oil wealth -- largely accruing to the Obiang family -- and the widespread poverty of the population. Infant mortality, for instance, has actually increased since the discovery of oil here in the 1990s, the World Bank said, adding that Mr. Obiang holds ''absolute executive power.'' ''You can have a debate about every one of the statistics,'' Ambassador Alberto M. Fernandez said. The American presence here is discreet but vital, and Mr. Obiang professes great love for the United States. Chevron, Marathon Oil and Noble Energy have substantial interests in Equatorial Guinea, onshore and off, and American oil workers are easily spotted at the diminutive airport at the edge of town. The sea around Bioko Island, where Malabo, the capital, is located, is dotted with telltale flares from oil company installations. The presence of M.P.R.I., the Virginia military security company led by the retired general Bantz J. Craddock, the former supreme allied commander in Europe, has raised eyebrows among human rights groups and local dissidents. The State Department vetoed the company's work here because of Equatorial Guinea's poor human rights record , but finally acceded under President Bush in 2005 amid promises of reform by Mr. Obiang's government, according to Human Rights Watch. Despite M.P.R.I.'s work with the country's police, Mr. Nowak, the former United Nations torture investigator, found that guards and soldiers took turns administering electric shocks to political prisoners at the Playa Negra, or Black Beach, prison adjacent to the presidential palace in downtown Malabo. Mr. Nowak discovered these practices in November 2008, at least a year after M.P.R.I. had begun its human rights training here, according to the government's chronology. He and dissidents here contend that torture continues to be an ingrained government policy, though there is no evidence that M.P.R.I. either condones it or takes part. Still, Mr. Nowak said, ''if I were a trainer, I would leave the country because I would feel I was being used. It's a fig leaf operation.'' M.P.R.I. declined to comment, except to confirm, through a spokesman last November, that it had recently received a contract from Equatorial Guinea to ''in an overall, generic way, to provide security for the coastline, some coastal surveillance,'' a domain touching on Mr. Obiang's security concerns. In the most recent coup attempt, on Feb. 17, 2009, the presidential palace was attacked by gunmen who arrived at the dock below in boats. M.P.R.I.'s contract is worth $250 million, according to a press release. Despite the government's oil wealth, little has trickled down to the impoverished population. ''The interest of the Americans here is money,'' said Marcial Abaga Barril, a member of an opposition party. On paper, in per-capita income, the citizens are nearly as well off as those of Spain and Italy, thanks to oil. But in reality, nearly 77 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, according to Human Rights Watch. The sprawling, muddy slums of Campo Yaounde and Fiston -- with their dirt streets, wooden shacks and scarce electricity -- have nothing to do with the prim, tropical-Gothic cathedral that is the public face of the subdued island capital, where even critics of Mr. Obiang feel obligated to put his portrait on the wall for fear of the security services. ''The oil money hasn't come here,'' said Rosa Loka Moubake, a resident of Fiston. Mr. Obiang, who turns 70 next month and received military training in the early 1960s Spain of the military dictator Francisco Franco, insisted that the United States was his ally, placing the blame for recent summary executions of accused coup plotters on the unwanted persistence of ''Spanish colonial justice'' codes in his country. The interview broke up in a crackle of radio traffic on the walkie-talkies of Mr. Obiang's extensive security detail. Outside, the Spanish colonial plaza was dead quiet in the noonday heat. ''Nobody here wants to talk because everybody is afraid,'' said Mr. Barril, the opposition party member. ''Everybody shuts his mouth.''"6-Jun-11,NIGERIA (98%),"CAIRO - The International Monetary Fund agreed Sunday to a $3 billion loan to help Egypt overcome a cash crunch and boost salaries in the wake of the pro-democracy uprising that toppled the country's longtime president. The world's most populous Arab nation has been struggling to close a $10 billion budget deficit for the fiscal year beginning in July. Since the  ouster of Hosni Mubarak in February, the critical tourism industry has suffered major losses and foreign investment has tapered off. Independent polls show that Egyptians are pinning their hopes for an improved economy on a new government, to be chosen this year. Diplomats and analysts fear that if the country becomes unstable economically, the population could lose faith in democracy. The one-year loan, which carries a below-market interest rate of 1.5 percent, still needs final approval from the IMF executive board. ""Following a revolution and during a challenging period of political transition, the Egyptian authorities have put in place a home-grown economic program with the overarching objective of promoting social justice,"" Ratna Sahay, deputy director of IMF's Middle East Department, said Sunday. Egypt's annual budget, announced last week, would increase subsidies for food and fuel, create construction jobs and raise the minimum wage to about $30 a week, as well as increase some taxes. The Egyptian economy had been expanding strongly before the world economic crisis, but authorities now expect only 2.5 percent growth this year, less than half of what had been forecast. Unemployment is more than 10 percent, and much higher among the young people whose frustration fueled the revolution. Anger over government corruption, and the yawning gap between rich and poor, also contributed to the uprising. Egypt's interim government has appealed for financial help from multilateral financial institutions and wealthy allies, and  Saudi Arabia has provided $4 billion in grants and loans. The World Bank has promised about $4.5 billion over two years in grants, loans and loan guarantees. President Obama has pledged to swap $1 billion in Egyptian debt for development projects in the country, but that may take months to get congressional approval. He has also offered $1 billion in loan guarantees. Egyptian Finance Minister Samir Radwan said that despite the promises, Egypt had received more ""hugs and kisses"" than actual money. sheridanm@washpost.com Western Officials Seek Softer Approach to Militants in Nigeria  ABUJA, Nigeria -- Amid increasing evidence that the Nigerian government's heavy-handed strategy for containing a radical Islamist sect has failed, some Western officials are urging a new and less militarized approach. The suicide bombing of the United Nations headquarters here on Friday, which killed 23 people, has added urgency to their appeal, demonstrating that the sect, Boko Haram, has expanded its scope well beyond domestic targets. Far from being crushed by Nigerian firepower, Boko Haram, which claimed responsibility for the attack, appears to be confirming the worst fears of Western analysts and diplomats -- that repression is hastening its transformation into a menacing transnational force, with possible links to Al Qaeda's North African affiliates. Repeated Nigerian military incursions against the group have yielded many civilian casualties but still not stopped Boko Haram. It merely went underground after a bloody operation against it in 2009, and now carries out regular attacks against the Nigerian government. ''I think we'd like to see Nigeria take a more holistic approach,'' said the American ambassador here, Terence P. McCulley, in an interview at the well-guarded and fortresslike United States Embassy here in the Nigerian capital. ''Clearly, the 2009 tactics may have contributed to the current direction,'' he said, adding that the Nigerian security forces should not jeopardize civilians in their operations. He suggested that the government ''address the grievances'' of the northern population on economic and social matters. Boko Haram continues to call for a strict application of Shariah law and the freeing of imprisoned members in northern Nigeria, where mass unemployment and poverty have fueled social discontent. Overall, some 50 million youths are underemployed, the World Bank says, in a country of 154 million. Despite abundant oil revenues, incomes have barely budged in 30 years, life expectancy is only 48 and the country remains one of the most economically unequal in the world, the United Nations says. In the wake of Friday's bombing, analysts and officials warn that those factors make repression a poor tactic for confronting Boko Haram. ''The chickens have come home to roost,'' said another Western diplomat, who was not authorized to speak publicly. ''Nigeria's political elite has been ruling irresponsibly for decades, shamelessly plundering the nation's wealth with little or no regard for the country's masses,'' the diplomat said in an e-mail. ''The rise of Boko Haram and its millions of tacit, quiet supporters is a challenge to this corrupt political class.'' A Nigerian government spokesman was not immediately available for comment. Mr. McCulley, the American ambassador, called the United Nations bombing a ''paradigm shift,'' adding that ''it suggests Boko Haram has upped its game, if you will. It seems to show it wishes to expand its scope beyond the domestic.'' The ambassador said that the attack on the United Nations was a ''game changer,'' and that American interests could also be in the group's sights. ''It would be foolish to consider that we are not a possible target as well,'' he said. Indeed, in a conference call after the attack, a man describing himself as a spokesman for Boko Haram said that the United States was culpable because it ''has been collaborating with the Nigerian government to clamp down on our members nationwide.'' Both he and another self-described spokesman warned of more attacks to come. Mr. McCulley, while saying there was no ''direct evidence'' of links between Boko Haram and Al Qaeda, said the group's attacks have ''become more sophisticated, more Al Qaeda-like. They've adopted some of their tactics.'' Other Western and Nigerian officials and analysts say members of Boko Haram have met and trained with Qaeda affiliates outside the country. They also cite propaganda by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in which the group boasts of assisting Boko Haram and pledges to help it avenge attacks on Muslims in Nigeria, including the killing of Boko Haram's leader during the 2009 military assault. Mr. McCulley said that current American training programs with Nigerian security services could be expanded. ''I believe that going forward we're going to have a more robust engagement with the army,'' he said. F.B.I. agents arrived here to assist with the investigation soon after the bombing. Even after the deadly United Nations bombing, which killed 11 United Nations staff members, including 10 Nigerians and one Norwegian woman, political violence attributed to Boko Haram continued in northern Nigeria over the weekend. A bomb was thrown into the home of the former police minister -- no one was injured -- and a local official was shot in his home by gunmen in Borno State, the center of the insurgency. These attacks have become so routine in northern Nigeria that they now rate only a few paragraphs in the country's newspapers. On Tuesday, Nigerian media reported that the national police chief, Hafiz Ringim, announced arrests in the United Nations bombing, but previous such arrests have not led to any decline in Boko Haram's activities. Mr. Ringim had vowed earlier that Boko Haram's days were ''numbered,'' and after his headquarters in Abuja was bombed in June, the police chief announced a crackdown. ''I don't think the federal government knows who they are; that's problem No. 1,'' a Western official said in an interview here last month. The official, not authorized to speak publicly, said of the 2009 crackdown, ''They didn't really know what to do, so, 'Let's just send in a bunch of military and police, and wipe 'em all out.' ''"5-Sep-11,NIGERIA (95%); WESTERN AFRICA (92%); NIGER (79%) Nigeria,"As prosecutors prepare to bring former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak back to court on Monday, a quiet but intensive global effort is underway to find assets allegedly stolen by Mubarak family members and their associates. Thus far, the search - prompted by an Egyptian request sent to countries around the world - has located about $520 million in assets in Switzerland that Swiss authorities say have been frozen. But no money has been returned to Egypt, and it is far from certain whether any will be recovered. Even those accounts frozen by the Swiss amount to a fraction of the alleged billions of dollars in illicit assets that Mubarak and his sons, Alaa and Gamal, have been accused of acquiring. The Mubaraks and their attorneys strongly deny the allegations. In the United States, Treasury and Justice department officials, whose spokeswomen declined to comment, have taken no action to freeze or seize assets. But Egyptian officials have indicated they are working with U.S. authorities to try to find any recoverable funds or property. Rumors of stolen assets and the wealth of the Mubaraks and many of their friends were among the main factors fueling public anger before Mubarak's downfall. A staggering wealth gap exists in Egypt, where the average working wage is a few dollars a day. Egyptians remain unhappy that no assets have been returned. ""People are disappointed, to say the least, given that the country is going through hard times when it comes to the economy,"" said Wael Ghonim, a former Google executive who was an Internet organizer during the revolt. ""If Europe and the U.S. are serious about helping Egypt, then helping the current government return those assets back to the Egyptian people is crucial."" That Egypt has yet to recover pilfered assets does not surprise specialists in the area of recovering funds stolen by heads of state and senior government officials - called ""kleptocrats"" by the U.S. Justice Department. ""There are huge expectations,"" said Jean Pesme, coordinator of the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative, jointly operated by the World Bank and the United Nations. ""It is not going to happen overnight."" Tracking down stolen assets can be complicated. Some kleptocrats hide the money using tactics such as shell companies and clandestine intermediaries. And most countries require a judicial finding that the money was illegally obtained before it can be returned. ""The difficulty will be how much evidence can be brought to show that specific assets belong to or are controlled by people who are undertaking corrupt activities,"" Pesme said. U.S. officials have been asked repeatedly why they have not ordered banks to freeze any Mubarak assets, yet moved in light of the Arab Spring revolts to freeze the U.S. accounts of Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Officials have explained that Treasury's sanctions programs are aimed at altering or penalizing malevolent behavior or preventing terrorism, drug trafficking or, in the case of the Middle East revolts, halting violent attacks on peaceful demonstrators and democratically inspired uprisings. For example, a senior administration official said last month said that the freezing of more than $30 billion in Libyan assets was part of a multi-pronged ""effort to stop a massacre in its tracks, to reverse the momentum against Gaddafi, to create space for the Libyan people to organize."" In the case of Egypt, Mubarak was forced from power before the United States froze any assets in connection with uprisings in the region. Treasury, however, did issue a reminder to banks that it is illegal to launder or hold the illicit proceeds of kleptocrats. Switzerland's order called for a freeze on assets of not only the Mubaraks - including the ousted president's wife, his sister-in-law, his sons and their wives - but several government ministers and billionaire steel magnate Ahmed Ezz, a senior party official. ""These assets were not confiscated but frozen,"" Swiss officials said in a news release in May announcing the order.""The freezing of these assets does not demonstrate their legal or illegal origin,"" Swiss officials said in a news release in May. ""Thus, it is now up to the Egyptian judicial authorities to determine, through criminal proceedings, whether these assets were illicitly acquired."" The Swiss have sent a team of experts to Cairo to help Egyptian judicial officials revise their request for ""mutual legal assistance,"" the formal procedure used to ask for assets to be returned, Swiss foreign affairs spokesman Adrian Sollenberger said. Of about a dozen such requests, only one has been forwarded to the Swiss Attorney General's Office, the authority that will review and possibly execute it, said Folco Galli, spokesman for the Swiss Justice Department. The others ""still don't meet the formal requirements and have to be completed,"" Galli said. Ted S. Greenberg, former head of the money-laundering unit at the U.S. Justice Department, said there are several possible reasons for the U.S. government's inaction. ""There might not be any proceeds in the United States, or that passed through the United States, or it may be that the Egyptian government has not yet provided sufficient evidence to the United States about crimes in question,"" he said. grimaldij@washpost.com . . . but still has questions to answer  The media circus generated by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's annual visit to the U.N. General Assembly in New York is a source of great frustration for many Iranians, who wish Western journalists would ask tougher questions about Ahmadinejad's domestic practices. The following questions are culled from Iranian democracy and human rights activists who don't have a chance to query the president directly: Your boss, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was selected by a few dozen clerics more than 20 years ago. Do you believe that he - as his office has asserted - is the prophet's representative on Earth? Khamenei hasn't left Iran since 1989. Nearly half of Iran's population was born after 1989. Do you think this provides him with a good understanding of the modern world in which they live? One of your key clerical backers, Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi, proclaimed after your contested reelection in 2009 that obeying you was akin to obeying God. More recently he has asserted that you are under the influence of Satan. What explains Mesbah Yazdi's, or God's, fickleness? There is evidence that your chief adviser, Rahim Mashai, helped secure loans for the leading suspect in a $2.6 billion bank fraud case, the largest embezzlement scandal in Iranian history. You came to office vowing to ""cut off the hands"" of the corrupt; how will you deal with Mashai? Your opponents in 2009, Mir Hossein Mousavi, 69, and Mehdi Karroubi, 73, have been held incommunicado for nearly a year. On what basis are they confined? If they have no influence, as you have said, why are they under house arrest? Somayeh Tohidlou, a 32-year-old female sociology PhD student, recently received 50 lashes in prison for having ""insulted"" you by campaigning for Mousavi in 2009. Do you believe that men lashing women for their political views is an appropriate form of punishment? You said last September that ""freedom is a divine right."" Does that apply to Iran's Bahais, who are persecuted for practicing their faith, discriminated against in the workplace and imprisoned for attempting to educate their youth, who have been barred from university? In March you claimed that Iran is ""the best example for asserting human rights in the world."" So why has your government refused to allow the U.N. special rapporteur for human rights in Iran, Ahmed Shaheed, to visit your country and investigate allegations of human rights violations? In a BBC survey of 27 countries, including non-Western nations such as China, Nigeria and the Philippines, Iran ranks as ""the most negatively viewed of all countries rated,"" even below North Korea, with just a 16 percent favorability rating. Why? According to a recent Zogby poll, popular support for Iran in the Arab world has recently ""plummeted.""  Qatari Prime Minister Hamad Bin Jasim al-Thani described his country's relationship with your government as ""they lie to us, and we lie to them."" Why do you believe that you are ""a source of inspiration"" to Arabs? Nongovernmental organizations, including Transparency International, Freedom House and the World Bank, have said that Iran's rates of corruption, economic malaise and repression during your tenure are higher than those of Hosni Mubarak's Egypt and Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali's Tunisia. Are you confident you won't share their fate? Iran's closest ally since the 1979 revolution, Syria, has brutally killed more than 2,600 citizens this year - including children - who were protesting for greater political freedoms. How do you reconcile your country's close friendship with Bashar al-Assad's regime, given your claim to stand for justice and the oppressed? The anti-government protests in Iran on June 15, 2009,  were significantly larger than any  protests in the Middle East this year, yet you referred to the protesters as ""dust and dirt."" Do you regret using that term? In leaked diplomatic cables, a senior Iraqi tribal leader asserted that your government has provided him and other Iraqi officials ""short-term marriages"" with Iranian women in order to garner influence. Does Iran use prostitution as a form of statecraft? During your presidency Iran has had the highest per capita execution rate in the world, including recent public executions  and executions of people accused of being homosexual. Are you proud of this record? Ali Vakili Rad, who was convicted by the French in 1991 for the brutal stabbing death of 77-year-old Iranian democracy activist Shapour Bakhtiar in Paris, was given an official hero's welcome at the Tehran airport upon his release from prison last year. Why does your government glorify assassins? The writer is an associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The players and the stakes  Afghanistan Growth rate in 2010: +8.2% Current account balance: -$1.28 billion Even without decades of war, a ruinous Taliban regime and an ongoing insurgency, Afghanistan would face a steep climb toward economic sustainability. Landlocked and mountainous, it lacks the infrastructure, industry, security and human capital to build self-reliance. Eighty-five percent of Afghans depend on agriculture for their livelihood, and the illicit opium trade is a prime source for corruption. China has shown an interest in  the nation's mineral deposits, but instability complicates those efforts. Even the main source of its recent growth is at risk. The IMF last year suspended its primary credit program in Afghanistan, which prompted donors to hold back payments to the World Bank -managed Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund. As the United States contemplates a military drawdown, the global community is left to ponder how and whether to commit to Afghanistan's future. But Afghanistan is the type of country in crisis for which the World Bank and IMF were created, so a collective inability to manage the problem will raise questions about the return on investment for development aid in war-torn regions. Libya Data not available The IMF and World Bank in mid-September formally recognized Libya's Transitional National Council as the legitimate governing authority over the civil-war-ravaged North African country. This was more than symbolic, as it enables Libya to receive foreign financing to help it rebuild after decades of rule by Moammar Gaddafi and months of fighting. Libya faces major challenges. State entities suffered under the authoritarian Gaddafi regime from inept and bureaucratic mismanagement. Gaddafi's oil revenue almost certainly was misused and partially lost, so taking advantage of Libya's most lucrative natural resource will be difficult at first. And even when the government can again take in significant oil revenue, the new leadership must avoid the common distorting effect that an oil-based economy can have on income inequality. No one knows how the council will manage the transition from rebellion to governance. Time will reveal just how badly the state was managed, including its sovereign wealth fund, infrastructure and oil production. The meetings will test its ability to work with the World Bank and IMF. Pakistan -$3.1 billion Income inequality, crushing poverty, high illiteracy and rural underdevelopment all are layered onto a tense political and security environment. Relations with the United States deteriorated following the U.S. military raid that killed Osama bin Laden. And Islamabad's relationship with New Delhi is a perpetual fault line that could erupt over any number of issues, including Kashmir and Islamic fundamentalism,  which India views as Pakistan's most insidious export. That Pakistan is nuclear-armed only adds to the vigilance with which the West watches developments in the region, with Washington tying  aid to a report card on which Islamabad must show progress. The United States and India aren't the only two giants with which Pakistan must contend, as China's influence grows. But Beijing has its own questions, especially regarding militant Islam and in recent years violence against Chinese citizens living and working in Balochistan province. Pakistan's weak economy depends on IMF and World Bank money. At the meetings, IMF officials are due to meet with Pakistani leaders in a bid to get a suspended $11 billion loan program back on track. Egypt -$6.3 billion Saddled with high unemployment, stifling poverty and fallout from the global crisis even before the fall of Hosni Mubarak's government in February, Egypt now must piece together a post-revolution economy against the backdrop of exceedingly high expectations. The old regime may be gone, but many of Egypt's systemic problems remain. A mid-September mob assault of the Israeli Embassy in Cairo showcases the difficult balance the interim government must find between establishing a stable, investment-friendly environment and allowing the grass-roots sentiment behind the anti-Mubarak protests to let off steam. Cairo does not appear to be interested in walking away from its treaty obligations with Israel, for example, but popular sentiment leans toward a more confrontational stance with Israel and the United States. Egypt turned down a badly needed $3 billion IMF loan in June, perhaps reflecting the country's skepticism of Western institutions. Regional political rifts and energy prices can alter Cairo's outlook regardless of new government policy because Egypt relies on tourism, oil and gas exports and Suez Canal revenue. Turkey -$64 billion Turkey comes to this year's annual meetings with a laundry list of political tensions: a restless Kurdish minority, diplomatic turmoil with Israel, a recent en masse resignation of its top military leaders, an ongoing dispute with Greece over Cyprus, and a delicate balancing act between Turkey's role as a secular democratic republic and the political expedience of increasing religiosity. In stark contrast to the troubled European Union, which Turkey has been a candidate to join since 1999, the Turkish economy grew at the fastest rate of any in the world in the first quarter of 2011. However, the country lacks the natural resources plentiful in other emerging economies such as Brazil, and because of its high taxes, lax intellectual-property rights and high manufacturing costs, it has yet to attract much foreign investment. Moreover, Turkey's recent aggressive foreign policy could yield mixed results as it alienates Israel, raises alarm in Washington and gives pause to Arab leaders with no interest in its dominance. Its decisions are likely to continue to complicate - though not necessarily impede - its long-term economic prospects and geopolitical relationships. Canada Growth rate in 2010: +3.1% Current account balance*: -$49.1 billion Three of Canada's key concerns - the health of the U.S. economy, the emergence of the BRIC markets (Brazil, Russia, India, China) and the European debt crisis - will be prominently featured during this year's annual meetings. Trade between the United States and Canada accounts for millions of jobs in both countries. The United States takes in roughly three-fourths of Canada's exports, including a variety of energy sources. Canada is also ""the leading export market for 35 of the 50 U.S. states and is a larger market for U.S. goods than all 27 countries of the European Union,"" according to the State Department. Canada is seeking to strengthen trade with China, India and Brazil and cement its Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the beleaguered European Union. The next round of talks is set for October in Ottawa. Canada has weathered the global economic downturn well compared with other developed countries, in part because of its conservative approach to lending and strict banking regulations. But decreased global demand and a sluggish U.S. economy are reasons for concern in Ottawa, especially in light of an alarming rise in Canada's household debt. Mexico Growth rate in 2010: +5.5% Current account balance: -$10.5 billion Mexico's fortunes are inextricably linked to its relationship with the United States. The World Bank calls Mexico's recent recession ""brief, but very deep,"" and says it resulted in part from Mexico City's reliance upon trade with the United States. The demand in the United States for illicit drugs also affects Mexico; the World Bank says more than 15,000 people were killed by drug-related violence in 2010. Remittances - sent mostly from Mexicans living in the United States - ""average around U.S. $21 billion per year, and are the country's second-largest source of foreign currency, after oil,"" according to the State Department. Although Mexico has made strides to develop its economy, the World Bank reports that almost half of the country's residents live in poverty. Mexico is a major beneficiary of World Bank and IMF programs. The IMF in early 2011 approved a two-year, $72 billion flexible credit line, replacing a one-year, $48 billion credit line. As the name of the loan suggests, Mexico can exercise a degree of discretion over how it uses the money, including when it spends it. United States Growth rate in 2010: +2.8% Current account balance:-$493.9 billion The U.S. economic slump will probably be a major issue at the meetings. World leaders will be looking for some sign that Washington can balance the competing needs of medium-term debt reduction and short-term growth as the country heads into a presidential election year. Jobless data highlight the difficulty of finding a political solution to economic problems. They also reveal socioeconomic divides: Unemployment among blacks stood at 16.7 percent in August, compared with 8 percent for whites. The persistent weakness in the housing market, a credit rating downgrade after a deeply partisan debate over the debt ceiling and lingering military roles in Afghanistan and Iraq all add to Washington's prestige problem. Even President Obama's proposed $447 billion package of tax cuts and government spending has been overshadowed by the debt crisis in Europe. The United States is the world's largest economy and the biggest contributor to the IMF and World Bank, and no major policy shifts can take place without its leadership. Even so, it has become clear the world cannot count on U.S. growth to be the engine that powers the global economy out of the ditch. . . . and this month he reaffirmed Turkey's NATO ties by allowing a sophisticated American radar system on Turkey's soil. Erdogan is attempting to reach out to the Muslim world while not turning away from traditional allies in Europe and the United States. Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's acerbic reaction to last year's disastrous flotilla incident sparked an ongoing diplomatic row with Israel, but he recently enraged the Muslim Brotherhood when he called for Egypt to build a secular democratic state . . . The Islamic world They may share a common religion, but their prospects for the future are wildly divergent. Turkey alone seems poised to take advantage of shifting geopolitical currents. A NATO member with European Union aspirations, it has better managed its relationship with the West, while Pakistan's remains strained. Afghanistan, invaded by the British in the 19th century, the Soviets in the 1980s and a U.S.-led coalition in 2001, has even less control over its affairs. Libya's oil reserves and Egypt's critical relationship with Israel mark each as a strategically significant country. But it's unclear how their interim governments will manage the transition from autocratic rule. As finance ministers and central bank governors gather this weekend for the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the fund's most recent World Economic Outlook highlights slowing global activity and renewed financial instability as critical issues.   _     The United States hopes Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner's mid-September reception in Europe is not the shape of things to come. The Austrian finance minister called Washington's attempt at leadership ""peculiar,"" and it's evident that the United States has lost some luster since the 2008 financial crisis and this summer's bitter debate over raising the debt ceiling. But if Washington's brand is tarnished, Europe is at risk of being left behind because of the continent's crippling sovereign debt crisis and doubts about the euro's viability.  _ Historians 50 years from now might very well look back at this meeting as the beginning of a dramatic shift in the global order, with emerging economies taking on increasing leadership roles and calling into question the long-term viability of Western-dominated institutions. Headlines asking variations of ""Can China Save Europe?"" - inconceivable 10 years ago - now show up in newspapers the world over.  _  Nevertheless, emerging economies face troubling questions of their own, as income inequality and crushing poverty persist even where emerging middle classes offer citizens access to Western standards of wealth. The lessons of globalization offer a glimpse into a simple and cruel truth: There will be winners, and there will be losers. Seen in that light, the annual meetings represent an opportunity for countries around the world to determine the camp into which they will fall. *The current account balance is the sum of a country's net trade in goods and services, plus a combination of other earnings such as interest and net transfer payments to and from the rest of the world. Wall St. Giants Seek a Piece of Nigeria's Sovereign Fund  Wanted: A reliable overseas business partner to invest more than $1 billion presently trapped in Nigeria. This is not a scam. Nigeria, the West African nation that has gained notoriety for the illicit e-mail spammers aiming for Western bank accounts, is attracting attention for legitimate financial opportunities - investing its own savings. In an effort to preserve and increase its oil revenue, the country recently established a so-called sovereign wealth fund, following the path of many resource-rich countries. Now, Wall Street titans like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase are courting top government officials, aiming to grab a piece of a portfolio that could eventually be worth tens of billions of dollars. ""The country is at a point of inflection, and what we do in the next few years will set the pace,"" said Olusegun Aganga, the former Nigerian finance minister and current minister for trade and investment, who helped create the sovereign wealth fund. ""It's a land of opportunities, which unfortunately has not been tapped well."" More than half a century after discovering oil in the Niger Delta, the country continues to subsist barrel to barrel. Poverty is rampant. Public corruption is pervasive. And the government coffers are bare, even though Nigeria is the 10th-largest oil producer in the world. By saving and investing the petro dollars, Nigeria hopes to break the resource curse. The nation, which derives 80 percent of its revenue from oil, created the sovereign wealth fund to buffer its economy from volatile commodity prices and impose fiscal discipline. The government so far has set aside $1 billion for the fund, and it could funnel as much as $2.5 billion a year, if oil prices remain high. ""One of our biggest problems in civil society is the time horizon that we're operating on - whether election cycles or quarterly reports,"" said Ashby H.B. Monk, a research associate at the University of Oxford who studies sovereign wealth funds. ""The idea of a sovereign fund is to give government bureaucrats an opportunity to make long-term policy knowing that the buffeting winds of capitalism won't blow them off course."" Such funds have become powerful investment forces over the years. Abu Dhabi and Kuwait have amassed hundreds of billions of dollars by plowing their oil riches into stocks, bonds and other global assets. During the financial crisis, sovereign wealth funds provided critical capital to banks and other troubled firms. To grab a piece of the lucrative business, big banks and asset managers have tirelessly cultivated relationships with governments worldwide and added teams dedicated to sovereign wealth funds. In recent months, bankers, lawyers and consultants flew to the Nigerian capital of Abuja to pitch officials on their services. The government chose JPMorgan Chase as one of its advisers on the structuring of the fund. In other countries, the Wall Street feeding frenzy has drawn criticism. The Libyan Investment Authority, which was started in 2006, has complained that it lost millions of dollars on several investments, while money managers generated huge fees, according to documents leaked this summer to Global Witness, an advocacy group. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into whether American money managers, in trying to land business with sovereign wealth funds, violated antibribery laws, according to people with knowledge of the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly about the inquiry. ""If you don't get these organizations designed correctly as sophisticated investment operations, you can lose a lot of money,"" Mr. Monk said. ""It's the power of finance - for good or bad."" Nigeria's new fund is the brainchild of Mr. Aganga, a Nigerian native who worked at Ernst & Young's London office before joining Goldman Sachs in 2001. Last year, the Nigerian president, Goodluck Jonathan, asked Mr. Aganga to join his cabinet. As the minister of finance, Mr. Aganga pushed to start a sovereign wealth fund almost immediately. He had helped oversee part of Goldman's Africa business, and knew Nigeria was among the last oil-rich nations without an investment portfolio. ""It's important that we have some savings for the future generations,"" Mr. Aganga said. ""It just makes sense for your economy. You're completely exposed otherwise."" But Nigeria has a spotty record managing its money. In 2004, the country started plowing extra oil revenue into a separate account, as a way to build savings. At one point, the portfolio held an estimated $20 billion, analysts say. The funds did not last long. State and federal authorities leaders regularly siphoned off money to fill budget holes, build utilities or pay for other projects. By last year, the assets had plummeted to less than $1 billion. ""There were no rules about withdrawals or whom it belonged to among the three tiers of government in Nigeria,"" said Razia Khan, head of African research at Standard Chartered Bank. To avoid making the same mistakes, Nigeria is earmarking assets for different purposes in a structure that mirrors older sovereign wealth funds. One portfolio, which will invest in stocks and bonds, is focused on long-term growth in preparation for the day when the oil wells run dry. An infrastructure portfolio will support upgrades to the country's bridges, roads, buildings and railways. During periods of weakness, the government will have an emergency account to prop up the economy. But officials will be able to access the money only under certain circumstances, like a steep drop in oil prices. Commitment will be crucial. Some politicians are already grumbling that the sovereign wealth fund will divert assets that the economy desperately needs now, and they are threatening to derail the effort. Such pressure, said John Campbell, a former United States ambassador to Nigeria and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan research center, could prompt the country to ""raid the cookie jar"" to deal with short-term issues. ""Unless there is the political will to live up to those aspirations,"" he said, ""it's not going to work very well."" ""My view is, better mute the trumpets for the time being,"" Mr. Campbell said. It will come down to execution, say Nigerian officials and outside analysts. The government is tapping an independent board to oversee the investment process and to ensure compliance. While critics point to the delay in naming those directors as a potential concern, authorities defend their position. They argue that the new finance minister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a former managing director at the World Bank, who was sworn in this August, needs time to learn all about existing matters. The board ""will define how effective this becomes,"" said Fola Oyeyinka, an adviser to the Nigerian minister of finance. ""The flavor of that board will dictate not just to Nigerians but to the world how serious we are."""20-Nov-11,"NIGERIA (99%); UNITED STATES (93%); IRAN, ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF (79%); NIGER (79%)","WHEN news breaks in Nigeria, Omoyele Sowore is there. His Web news operation was the first to publish a photo of the Nigeria-born ''underwear bomber'' arrested in December 2009, and when a suicide bombing this summer shook a United Nations building in Abuja, Nigeria's capital, he was the first to publish on-the-ground reports and photos. During the presidential election in Nigeria in April, he published real-time photos, videos and reports from the field, exposing instances of ballot rigging, and attracting over eight million page views in one month. Mr. Sowore, 40, is not based in Abuja, Lagos or anywhere nearby, but in a cluttered seventh-floor office on a gritty stretch of West 29th Street in Manhattan. Armed with a laptop and a server, he has established his Web site, Sahara Reporters, as a major player in the Nigerian press, despite being 5,000 miles away. And he is only one of a growing number of New York-based journalists in exile taking advantage of cheap and easy Web-publishing technology, and the growing access in the developing world to the Web, to report with impunity from afar. A recent report from the Committee to Protect Journalists, an organization devoted to promoting press freedom, counted at least 649 journalists from around the world forced into exile over the past decade, with 91 percent unable to return home, and only 22 percent able to work in their profession. These include reporters from dictatorships like Cuba, but also from places like Russia and Mexico -- democracies where working as a truth-seeking reporter can be a dangerous proposition. In Nigeria, ''now that we have, so to speak, democracy, you would expect the media to be more vibrant, but the opposite is the case,'' Mr. Sowore said in an interview. ''It is not so much a problem of freedom of speech,'' he said, ''but freedom after speech. You can say a lot of things in Nigeria, but the question is: Will you still be a free person? Will you still be alive after you freely express yourself?'' MR. SOWORE grew up in a small village on the Niger River Delta, where, he said, corrupt government officials reaped the benefits of the region's oil-rich land while doing little to improve the lives of its impoverished residents. That experience impelled him to become a leader of antigovernment activists while a student at the University of Lagos, a position that he said resulted in his being harassed, abducted and ultimately tortured at the hands of the pro-government police. In 1999, he attended a peace conference at American University in Washington. Fellow activists recommended he seek help in the United States for the psychological aftereffects of torture, and one colleague put him in touch with the Bellevue/NYU Program for Survivors of Torture, an initiative that helps victims rebuild their physical and mental health. He had planned to go back to Nigeria, but doctors advised, for his mental health, against an immediate return. Instead, he sought political asylum in the United States and enrolled as a graduate student in public administration at Columbia University. Frustrated by his distance from his homeland, he soon realized that his re-entry into Nigerian political activism could come online. ''I have always been a lover of the media,'' Mr. Sowore said, reminiscing about a comparatively robust news landscape when a military junta led Nigeria from 1983 to 1998. ''These guys then were really daring. They would publish what they wanted, and weren't afraid of the military. The newspapers just refused to allow themselves to be proscribed.'' IN 2004, Mr. Sowore and Jonathan Elendu, a fellow Nigerian exile based in Michigan, created an online publication called Elendu Reports. Mostly, they focused on the questionable activities abroad of Nigerian politicians, publishing photographs of extravagant houses and luxury car collections allegedly bought with the spoils of corruption, and following paper trails to offshore accounts. Back home, their exposes ignited widespread outrage. The domestic press may have been too intimidated to report on the rampant corruption, but by publishing the articles online from a base here, Mr. Sowore and Mr. Elendu were free of government-sponsored violence. Meanwhile, rapidly spreading Internet access in Nigeria -- the World Bank estimates Nigeria had nearly 44 million Internet users in 2009, up from fewer than one million in 2003 -- helped them reach enough people that officials had no choice but to address the ensuing uproar. In several cases, the articles led to the arrests of prominent politicians. ''It just got bigger and bigger as we went along,'' Mr. Sowore said. ''People back in Nigeria thought we had some sort of wizardry, always finding these stories, but we were just following the money, and no one was able to stop us.'' Mr. Sowore said he had a falling out with Mr. Elendu in 2006. (Mr. Elendu could not be reached for comment.) Mr. Elendu continued with his site, but Mr. Sowore soon started Sahara Reporters, named less for geography than to symbolize his desire to ''kick up a storm across Nigeria,'' from the basement of his home in Englewood, N.J. Using a network of contacts in the United States and in Nigeria, he continued to report on corruption but also expanded into breaking news. Soon, reporters based in Lagos began to send him controversial dispatches that their own editors refused to print. Mr. Sowore is happy to publish them, shielding the reporters' names when necessary for their protection. ''Our reporters have a layer of protection they can't have in Nigeria, where the police can arrest you and harass you,'' Mr. Sowore said. ''They can't bomb our offices. They can't get the police to shut us down.'' In 2008, with financial support from the Ford Foundation and the Global Information Network, an independent, nonprofit organization focused on news from the developing world, Mr. Sowore moved his operation to Manhattan, although he also works from his home, his car, coffee shops or wherever he happens to be when a story breaks across the Atlantic. His workday often begins at midnight New York time, when Nigeria wakes up and he starts getting tips by phone and e-mail. IN contrast to Mr. Sowore, ''most journalists are unable to contribute from exile,'' said Lonnie Isabel, director of the International Reporting Program at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism. ''It's an enormously difficult transition,'' he said. ''There are language skills to learn, new technologies to deal with and many other barriers.'' To bolster the in absentia press corps, Mr. Isabel helped found CUNY's International Journalist in Residence Program, a joint initiative with the Committee to Protect Journalists that gives one international reporter each year full access to the journalism school's resources. The school's 2010 resident was Sonali Samarasinghe, a Sri Lankan journalist whose husband, also a journalist and an outspoken critic of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, was assassinated in 2009. Ms. Samarasinghe immediately fled after she received death threats. Classes in digital technology and entrepreneurial journalism helped her prepare for the recent start of her own Web site, Lanka Standard. In its first three months, it had 65,000 visitors, she said, many of them from within Sri Lanka. CUNY's newest journalist in residence is Agnes Taile, 31, a reporter from Cameroon who spent several years writing about corruption and human rights abuses in the northern region of her country before death threats and run-ins with the police led her to leave in 2009. This year she began Le Septentrion Info, a French-language Web site dedicated to news from that under-covered region. She hopes to soon expand the site and add an English version. Roozbeh Mirebrahimi, another alumnus of the CUNY program, worked for 10 years as a reporter and editor in Iran and was among the first journalists there to blog. In 2004 he was arrested and held in solitary confinement for two months, until he agreed to write a public confession saying he was a spy. In 2006 he left the country, ultimately landing in Brooklyn. Mr. Mirebrahimi's site, Iran dar Jahan (Iran in the World), features some original reporting, but its primary mission is to translate international news reports about Iran into Persian, so that Iranian readers can get a sense of what the world press has to say about their country. Iran had 28 million Web users as of 2009, according to the World Bank, the most in the Middle East. And while the government blocks access to Iran dar Jahan, many Iranians are adept at using proxy servers to gain access to banned sites. Mr. Mirebrahimi, who was sentenced in absentia by an Iranian court to two years in prison and 84 lashes, said his site had about 70,000 visitors a month. ''It would be impossible to do this kind of work inside Iran,'' he said. ''New York has been a great place to work from, because there are so many resources here and because the community is so welcoming to immigrants from all over the world.'' Of course, the ultimate dream for each of these far-flung publishers is to set off enough political change back home that exiles like themselves will one day be safe to return. ''I certainly hope to be publishing Sahara Reporters in Nigeria someday,'' Mr. Sowore said. ''Part of what we are doing now is fighting for a space to be able to do this legitimately, building it to the point where it will be useless to fight us.''"26-Nov-11,UGANDA (96%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (93%); AFRICA (93%),"KAMPALA, Uganda -- When billions of barrels of oil reserves were found in Uganda five years ago, the discovery seemed like a gift from heaven to many in this poor, landlocked country. Despite Ugandans' dreams of industrialization, the country's most lucrative export is coffee, and fish is second. Nearly 40 percent of the population survives on less than $1.25 a day, according to the World Bank. But when oil starts pumping within the next several years, the expected revenue of up to $2 billion a year could propel Uganda into the strata of middle-income countries, where few sub-Saharan African countries rank. A refinery will be built; infrastructure is promised. Yet there are growing worries that the oil may prove to be more of a curse than a gift, similar to the fates of other countries in sub-Saharan Africa that have joined the petroleum bonanza. Uganda is considered by international experts to be among the most corrupt nations in the world, and even before oil production has begun, several senior government officials, including the prime minister, have been accused of pocketing millions of dollars in bribes from oil companies, forcing at least one of the politicians to resign. The web of scandals may delay the much-anticipated starting date of oil production, adding to the already volatile politics in Uganda, which has recently been the scene of one of the most active protest movements in sub-Saharan Africa. Uganda's Parliament voted in an emergency session in mid-October to freeze all oil contracts and begin investigations of the country's prime minister, internal affairs minister and foreign minister, all of whom are close to the president and have been accused of taking money from Tullow Oil, a British company in Uganda that was scheduled to complete a $2.9 billion deal with the Ugandan government and two other companies to produce Uganda's oil. Tullow has denied the accusations. Despite governing for nearly 26 years and handily winning re-election again this year, President Yoweri Museveni now finds that his popularity seems to be waning, along with his grip on the economy and his own party. Many here say that the bribery allegations are part of a campaign by some politicians to determine who comes next. ''Most obviously, the jockeying is for positions,'' said Mahmood Mamdani, an anthropology professor at Columbia and Makerere University in Uganda, ''especially given the expectation that Museveni will not run the next time.'' Mr. Museveni's rise, from rebel to leader of a regional power, has paralleled Uganda's. In the capital, Kampala, vendors sell posters of the president's image edited into Terminator outfits, next to dictionaries and Bibles. He is prickly about criticism and refers to himself at times in the third person. ''Museveni can never be given money by anybody,'' the president said at an impromptu news conference he held last month in Kampala, lashing out when the bribery allegations were publicized. ''General Yoweri Museveni. To get money from a Muzungu, or anybody, for my personal use, is contempt of the highest order,'' he said, using Ugandan slang for Westerner. What could happen in Uganda has happened before in Angola, Gabon and Nigeria, all countries with deep corruption where oil intensified class disparities. ''The next generation of Ugandans could grow up in a very different country to that of their parents and grandparents,'' the advocacy organization Global Witness said in a 2010 report. ''But the risk of the resource curse phenomenon taking hold in Uganda cannot be ignored.'' Uganda has been rocked by a series of demonstrations over surging commodity prices -- particularly petroleum -- as inflation has hit 30 percent. Protesters say they are inspired by the Arab Spring revolts. It is not just the decreasing value of Uganda's currency that critics are complaining about; it is the way the money is being spent. The government was criticized in April for buying fighter jets from Russia for approximately $740 million, which some analysts saw as being costly status symbols rather than useful weaponry. According to the director of the Bank of Uganda, Mr. Museveni ordered the bank to release millions of dollars to pay for the fighter jets, which Mr. Museveni promised would be reimbursed with oil money, a prominent Ugandan newspaper reported. Uganda's oil lies underneath the forests and lakes lining the border with its troubled neighbor Congo. Oil industry and government officials estimate that Uganda will be able to pump about 200,000 barrels a day. But Uganda's oil is waxy, difficult to pump and expensive to refine. Still, the country has stated its intention to build a pipeline through Kenya to the port of Mombasa, and lawmakers have already accused Mr. Museveni of secretly selling off some crude oil to foreign nations. As private investors come and go from Uganda, there are worries that hundreds of millions of dollars are up for grabs in kickbacks and secret deals. According to American diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks, Tullow Oil accused the Italian company ENI of trying to bribe Ugandan politicians, including Mr. Museveni and the prime minister, with more than $200 million to secure oil rights held by Tullow's onetime partner, Heritage Oil, a British company. One cable cites a Ugandan intelligence report given to the American Embassy by Tullow. But Tullow Oil itself helped write the intelligence report, the cable said. As for the new bribery allegations, there are questions about their veracity, and some analysts believe that the politicians singled out -- all close to Mr. Museveni (the foreign minister is an in-law) -- are victims of a smear campaign to hurt their chances of succeeding Mr. Museveni. ''I have never let Uganda down,'' Mr. Museveni said during the news conference. ''Uganda will not lose, and cannot lose under my leadership. O.K.?''"17-Jan-12,NIGERIA (96%); LATIN AMERICA (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); ASIA (79%); MIDDLE EAST (79%); AFRICA (79%),"LAGOS, Nigeria -- Nigeria swallowed a hard lesson on Monday that has been inflicted on governments of developing nations the world over for years: try cutting subsidies for gas and the populace will erupt in rage. Faced down by thousands of demonstrators, demands for his removal and a weeklong general strike that paralyzed his fractious country, President Goodluck Jonathan abruptly gave in, partly restoring the fuel subsidy that -- more than an Islamic insurgency in the north or a long-running conflict in the south -- seemed to crystallize the frustrations of the people and draw them to the streets in outrage. ''Government appreciates that the implementation of the deregulation policy would cause initial hardships,'' Mr. Jonathan said in a stiffly worded capitulation on Monday, after a week of refusing to back down. Similar scenes have played out around the world in recent years, from Latin America to the Middle East to Asia, and the government response is frequently the same: give in quickly, despite the counsel of economists and international financial institutions that fuel subsidies are wasteful and distorting, sapping governments of money that could otherwise be used to improve education, public health or other needs. The Nigerian government spends about $8 billion a year on fuel subsidies, and getting rid of them would be ''an important first step'' to shoring up the finances of one of Africa's largest economies, according to a 2009 International Monetary Fund report. But in resource-rich countries like Nigeria, with its enormous gap between rich and poor, subsidized gas is one of the few benefits trickling down from an infamously corrupt government that has pocketed billions of dollars in oil profits, with little to show for it. For the poor -- and three-fourths of this country's population lives on about a dollar a day -- the fuel subsidy means a cheap ride to the market. It means lower prices for the food they buy there. And it means some sense of ownership in a national resource, oil, in which roughly 80 percent of the economic benefit has flowed to 1 percent of the population, according to some estimates. ''It's one of the few ways the urban and rural poor feel they benefit from this strategic resource,'' said Michael J. Watts, an expert on the politics of oil at the University of California, Berkeley. ''The fuel subsidy is experienced as one of the few things they get.'' That sentiment was strongly in evidence as the protests dwindled here on Monday. Under the rollback union leaders agreed to, gas in Nigeria will drop to about $2.27 a gallon from about $3.50 -- higher than the $1.70 price before Jan. 1, but low enough to end the strike. Still, many Nigerians were disappointed that Mr. Jonathan had not dropped the price all the way back down. ''We are not benefitting from this oil!'' shouted Ali Mohammed, a motorcycle-taxi driver. ''No lights, no roads, no hospitals. Make him reduce the price. We are suffering in this country.'' Hundreds of other young men milled about close by in what has been a center of the protest here: the New Afrika Shrine nightclub of the Afro-beat star Femi Kuti, son of the Nigerian musician and dissident Fela Kuti. In a speech Monday morning, Mr. Kuti both incited and calmed the crowd listening at his feet amid clouds of marijuana smoke, expressing disgust with Nigeria's institutions from his rickety wooden stage as supporters murmured their approval. Later in his office, Mr. Kuti shouted at his television as he watched the labor leaders announce the end of the strike. ''I told you those people would back down,'' he said to his aides, looking up from the screen. As for the government, he said, ''They prosecute people for being gay, but there is no law against stealing 14 million.'' Nigeria has seen similar tumult over the issue in the past, and it is hardly alone. In Bolivia, protesters burned photos of President Evo Morales and vandalized government buildings in December 2010, forcing Mr. Morales to withdraw his subsidy-cutting measure only days after introducing it. In Venezuela, before the rise of Hugo Chavez, days of riots and hundreds of deaths followed a fuel price rise in 1989. President Chavez now controls one of the world's most generous fuel subsidies, despite being critical of it. In Jordan, an announcement last year that subsidies would be lifted helped inspire antigovernment demonstrations that forced a reversal. In Indonesia, a 30 percent increase in fuel prices in 2008 led to bloody rioting. Economists nonetheless praise that country for doing what others often do not: sweetening subsidy removal with cash programs that aid the poor. Iran has employed a similar strategy, eliminating subsidized prices for fuel but cushioning the blow with cash payments of roughly $45 a month. The approach ''was critical in preventing the kind of thing that we're seeing happening in Nigeria,'' said Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, an economics professor at Virginia Tech, adding that other Middle East countries shouldering subsidies they can ill afford, most notably Egypt, are looking at Iran's plan as a possible model. The International Monetary Fund and other global financial institutions do not like fuel subsidies, pointing out that the biggest benefits do not even go to the poor, but rather to the owners of large cars and big generators. Yet it was not the wealthy in Nigeria, or even the small middle class, that forced Mr. Jonathan to back down most of the way. ''Even though most fuel subsidies go to the nonpoor, the fraction of their income that goes to fuel is much greater,'' said Shanta Devarajan, the World Bank's chief economist for Africa. ''That's why they feel the elimination of subsidies much more.'' On Monday in Lagos, the government appeared to be anticipating trouble, with army checkpoints on major roads, which were uncharacteristically deserted because of the strike. In the end the day was calm, though a feeling of anger at the unions for calling off the strike, and at the government for not restoring the full subsidy, permeated Mr. Kuti's hangarlike nightclub. The protest movement here, though brief, came to encompass frustrations broader than the sudden rise in fuel prices, and some of the young men milling about on Monday wore ''Occupy Nigeria'' T-shirts. The protesters made it clear that the fuel subsidy removal -- abrupt and unaccompanied by any palliative measures -- was seen as one more act of insensitivity by a government they criticized for favoring the wealthy. ''We are the people, but they are not listening to us,'' said Tayo Sola, an unemployed university graduate. ''So what is the meaning of democracy? You are not ready to listen. So how can you govern?''"7-Feb-12,UNITED STATES (93%); NIGERIA (92%); RUSSIAN FEDERATION (79%); AFRICA (57%),"Everyone in Kenya knows the phrase ""kitu kidogo."" It means ""something small"" in Swahili, and it refers to the bribes Kenyans pay minor bureaucrats, such as police officers and utility company employees, to make life easier. For decades, Kenyans had only their relatives and friends to complain to. Until now. A new Web site - I Paid a Bribe - is allowing Kenyans to share their experiences with bribery. Activists say the site could become a potent weapon in the fight against graft in one of the world's most corrupt nations. ""It brings a human face to corruption,"" said Samuel Kimeu, executive director of Transparency International-Kenya, an anti-corruption watchdog group. ""When people tell their stories the way they do on the Web site, it has the potential to catalyze action."" Drawing some inspiration from the Arab Spring uprisings, activism appears to be on the rise here and in many other corners of sub-Saharan Africa. Last year, protests erupted in Uganda and Malawi over bad governance and other issues. More recently, Nigerians have demonstrated against corruption and rising fuel prices, and activists in Senegal have rallied against President Abdoulaye Wade's bid for a third term. ""I'm calling what's happening in Kenya the 'Bribe Spring,' "" said Antony Ragui, the Web site's 36-year-old founder. ""People are fed up with corruption and the government. The real goal ofI Paid a Bribe is to harness the collective energy of Kenyans. I am trying to create a network of Kenyans who are anti-corruption-minded."" Ragui, a financial services consultant with an MBA from the University of California at Berkeley, said he returned to Kenya in 2007 to find a society that revolved around corruption. Out of 182 nations, only 28 are more corrupt than Kenya, according to Transparency International. ""I was tired of people whining about corruption. I wanted to do something about it,"" Ragui said. One day, Ragui read a magazine article about an Indian Web site - Ipaidabribe.com - that was fighting corruption. He contacted the site, which agreed to provide the software to start a similar effort in Kenya, its first spinoff. Launched last month, Ragui's site is divided into three sections. One part collects stories about bribes paid, listing the amount as well as where and when the incident occurred. Another section collects details about people who refused to pay bribes. And the third provides a forum for instances of honesty, when a bribe was not required. More than 400 bribes have been reported; the total amount paid is nearly 9 million Kenyan shillings - or about $110,000. One contributor wrote about ""our depressing first bribe,"" when she and her husband were stopped for an illegal U-turn late at night. The police officer asked her husband to step out of their car and ""took everything in his wallet."" ""Later, my colleague said, 'Never stop for a policeman on foot - they can't catch you!' "" the woman wrote. Others described paying police officers to investigate robberies and bribing bureaucrats to speed up licenses and passports. In many cases, police were accused of intimidating victims into paying bribes, going so far as to make up infractions. Contributors proudly provide advice on how to avoid paying bribes, which usually involves a lot of patience and bargaining. One person wrote about refusing to pay off an electricity company worker for reconnecting the power. ""I just told him I could stay in the dark for the whole weekend before he even saw a coin,"" the commenter wrote. ""I also threatened to call his boss. He reconnected me, which he should have done instead of aggravating me."" To prevent abuse and possible legal problems, the site's software blocks the names of bribe payers and recipients. The most vital information, Ragui said, is where, when and to which government body bribes are paid. T.R. Raghunandan, a spokesman for the Indian site, said activists in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, the Philippines and Nigeria have asked how to start sites. ""Working with Antony was very instructing for us,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""It gives us confidence to work with other countries. Our goal is to create a worldwide source of fighting corruption."" Ragui said he has met withthe World Bank and other organizations, seeking funds to expand and publicize the Web site. He wants to add a function that would allow victims to send text-message complaints to the site, enabling Kenyans to report corruption in real time. With the cost of living rising in Kenya, he hopes more people will reject paying bribes and fight the system. ""If I can change one department in the government,I can die a happy man,"" he said. raghavans@washpost.com More world news coverage: - U.S. weighs tactics shift in Afghanistan - Egypt to prosecute Americans in probe - Russia and China veto U.N. resolution on Syria - Read more headlines from around the world Hits, and Misses, in a War on Bribery Leslie Wayne is senior editor at 100Reporters, an independent nonprofit news organization.  PRISON is the last place Albert J. Stanley seemed destined for. But on Feb. 23, Mr. Stanley, a legendary figure in the high-octane world of Big Oil, was sentenced to two and a half years for his role in one of the biggest bribery cases in American history. It was a stunning downfall for a man who had spent his career clinching deals in far-flung corners of the world. But it turns out that Mr. Stanley, known as Jack, also played dirty: he pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe officials in Nigeria in return for $6 billion in business contracts. ''I am truly sorry,'' Mr. Stanley, the former chief executive of the engineering giant KBR, told a court in Houston last month. ''I lost touch.'' The particulars of his case aside -- Mr. Stanley said alcoholism played a role -- perhaps the most surprising aspect of this story is that it might have unfolded at any number of big corporations. Graft is alarmingly commonplace in global business today, so much so that the Justice Department is waging an aggressive -- and controversial -- campaign against it. At least 78 corporations are under investigation for possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a 35-year-old law that bans American companies from paying bribes to government officials abroad. Among those companies are such well-known names as Alcoa, Avon, Goldman Sachs, Hewlett-Packard, Pfizer and Wal-Mart Stores, although none of these companies have been charged. And, last week, it emerged that News Corporation, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch and has been trying to contain the damage from a long-running phone-hacking scandal in Britain, is the subject of an F.B.I. inquiry into possible bribery there and in Russia. A spokesman for the News Corporation, Jack Horner, declined to comment. Until recently, federal prosecutors had won settlements in nearly every battle involving charges of foreign bribery by multinational corporations and their executives. But in late February -- indeed, the very week that Mr. Stanley was sentenced -- the Justice Department had an embarrassing setback: it abruptly withdrew the biggest case ever brought against individuals under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. It was an extraordinary turn of events. The F.B.I. had recorded 800 hours of video and audio as part of a sting operation involving supposed arms contracts in Africa. Twenty-two executives had been arrested. Then the whole case fell apart. In a withering appraisal, the federal judge in the case, Richard J. Leon, called the government's effort ''a long and sad chapter in the annals of white-collar criminal enforcement.'' Its approach to the law, Judge Leon said, had been ''very, very aggressive.'' THE development opened the door for critics who assert that federal authorities have overstepped in trying to fight corruption overseas. They say that the crackdown, which began in earnest three years ago, has made it harder for companies to win legitimate business and that it has needlessly instilled fear among executives. Many companies would rather make any charges brought under the act go away with a quick settlement than try to fight them in court. ''We are seeing companies getting scooped up in aggressive enforcement actions and investigations,'' said Lisa A. Rickard, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce's Institute for Legal Reform, which is pushing to modify the law. ''A culture of overzealousness has grabbed the Justice Department.'' ''The last time I checked,'' Ms. Rickard added, ''we were not living in a police state.'' Such heated criticism aside, federal authorities say they are unbowed. Lanny A. Breuer, the assistant United States attorney general who has stepped up enforcement actions under the act, said he saw no reason to change course. In fact, he is expanding his staff -- and his range of potential targets. ''We have to be willing to take cases that we would be willing to lose,'' Mr. Breuer said in an interview. ''We can't just pick the easy cases.'' Even more, he sees himself on the right side of history, especially given the outcry against government corruption in the Arab world and elsewhere. ''This is not the time for the United States to be condoning corruption,'' Mr. Breuer said. ''We are a world leader and we want to do everything to make sure that business is less corrupt, not more.'' Enacted in 1977, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits American companies and foreign companies whose securities are traded on exchanges here from bribing foreign officials to attract or keep business. For many years, there were few prosecutions under the act. In 2003, for instance, not a single person was charged. But in the last four years, a total of 58 companies have paid a combined $3.74 billion to settle such corruption charges. Since 2009, some 67 people have been charged, 20 are still awaiting trial or are at large, and 42 have been convicted, some from charges prior to 2009. A total of 22 have been acquitted or had charges dismissed. One big fish the government has targeted is the son of the president of Equatorial Guinea, a tiny West African nation. The authorities say the man, Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, amassed over $100 million in the United States through corruption and money laundering while earning an annual government salary of under $100,000. The United States government filed a civil forfeiture complaint last October and is seeking to recover a $38.5 million Gulfstream V, a $30 million oceanfront home in Malibu, Calif., $1.8 million worth of Michael Jackson memorabilia and a 2011 Ferrari valued at more than $530,000. Calls to Mr. Obiang's lawyer were not returned last week. AS they pursue their overall campaign, federal authorities have their work cut out for them. As business has gone global, so has graft, particularly as companies in rich nations push into poorer regions. The World Bank estimates that $1 trillion in bribes is paid annually to government officials. In Africa alone, $148 billion is siphoned off annually, according to Transparency International, a global nonprofit group that tracks corruption. Jeffrey M. Kaplan, a lawyer in Princeton, N.J., who specializes in cases brought under the corruption act, said: ''You are talking about millions of dollars going to dictators who are selling their national patrimony in countries where you cannot even get clean water. Bribery is endemic to the human condition. If it cannot be rooted out, then you need to do something, and the F.C.P.A. is that.'' The law does not stop at American shores. Of the 10 largest corporate settlements, nine have involved companies outside the United States. One of the biggest cases involved Siemens, the German engineering company, which was accused in 2008 of bribing officials in a number of countries where it did business. Siemens paid $800 million to federal regulators here and another $800 million to German regulators to settle the case. But a criminal case continues against eight former Siemens executives and contractors, who were charged last December. The eight, none of whom are American, have been accused of paying $100 million in bribes to Argentine officials, including the former President Carlos Menem, to get business for Siemens, whose securities are traded in the United States. According to American authorities, a scheme began in the late 1990s, when the Siemens executives sought a $1 billion contract to make national identity cards for Argentine citizens. The authorities contend that after Siemens paid $16 million to President Menem and more to other Argentine officials, the government cooled on the project. Even after President Menem left office, the American complaint said, former members of his administration demanded payment and members of the incoming administration of President Fernando de la Rua demanded bribes, too. Mr. Menem has denied any wrongdoing, and Mr. de la Rua could not be reached for comment. The complaint said Argentine officials later threatened to expose the payments and, in the words of one defendant it quoted, demanded still more money ''to prevent potential physical harm'' to Siemens employees in Argentina. The complaint said bribes continued to flow until 2007, when the payments were finally uncovered. Since then, Siemens has ''been compliant with every anticorruption law around the world,'' said Peter Y. Solmssen, general counsel for Siemens. ''Our experience shows it pays off to pay attention to these issues.'' The defendants live in Germany, Switzerland or Argentina and have not been arrested or extradited. Among them was Uriel Sharef, a former Siemens board member; attempts to reach his lawyer in Germany were unsuccessful. In the United States, however, the battle between the Justice Department and its critics is heating up. One big complaint is that corporations would settle allegations rather than face the bad publicity of a trial. As a result, these critics say, the big settlements held up by the Justice Department represent hollow victories. What's more, some individuals are fighting back -- and winning. Citing prosecutorial misconduct, a federal judge in Los Angeles in December tossed out a conviction involving two American businessmen who were accused of paying bribes in Mexico. In January, a federal judge in Texas, citing lack of evidence, threw out a corruption case against an American businessman working for a Swiss company. To critics, such events show weakness in some of Washington's efforts. ''This is a facade of F.C.P.A. enforcement,'' said Mike Koehler, an assistant professor of business law at Butler University in Indianapolis, who writes the FCPA Professor blog. ''When you have cases in which the corporate defendant settles with neither admitting nor denying, that isn't a success. It is just a cost-benefit analysis.'' Matthew T. Reinhard, a white-collar defense lawyer in Washington, said that most corporations would prefer to settle because the potential losses are big if they lose in court. ''For corporations, if you lose, the way the law is written, the financial penalties can be catastrophic,'' he said. Mr. Breuer at the Justice Department counters that other white-collar cases often result in settlements, as well. ''I don't buy it,'' he said of the criticism. ''You could make the same argument for every other area of white-collar cases.'' Leading the efforts to modernize the corruption act -- or weaken it, in the eyes of the government -- is the Chamber of Commerce. The group, in Washington, has been in discussions with the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission about new guidelines on enforcement. That guidance, expected later this spring, would give corporations a better notion of what they need to do to stay on the right side of the law. Corporate America clearly wants its views heard. ''You are dealing with criminal liability, and that strikes fear and terror through the heart of the corporate suite,'' said Ms. Rickard at the chamber. In a letter signed by more than 30 trade associations, the chamber asks that the guidance allow companies with strong compliance programs to use that as a defense against liability. It also asks that the definition of a ''foreign official'' be more limited and that companies not be held accountable for the past wrongdoing of foreign companies they may purchase, among other provisions. Siding with the chamber is a range of business interests, including the American Gaming Association, the American Insurance Association, the Poultry Federation, TechAmerica, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association and the National Association of Manufacturers. The chamber has also lined up the firepower of Michael B. Mukasey, a former attorney general who has been pushing for changes to the corruption act in speeches and testimony before Congress. Mr. Breuer and other government lawyers have spoken out against the provisions. They have been joined by 33 human rights groups, including Amnesty International, Oxfam America and Transparency International. AND yet business interests aren't the only ones pushing back. People with the financial means are fighting, too. One closely watched case in legal circles is that of Frederic Bourke, co-founder of Dooney & Bourke, the luxury handbag company. He is appealing a 2009 conviction a in a bribery conspiracy case and has vowed to go all the way to the Supreme Court. As Mr. Bourke was about to enter prison last December, he got word that his appeal would be heard. He hardly seemed like a person who would end up facing jail time. His first wife was the great-granddaughter of Henry Ford, he owns homes in Aspen, Colo., Greenwich, Conn., and Maine, and he made a fortune in the handbag business. Mr. Bourke has said he simply fell in with a bad crowd. His former business partner is Viktor Kozeny, the fugitive financier known as the Pirate of Prague over accusations involving financial dealings in his native Czech Republic. Though charged, Mr. Kozeny has avoided extradition by remaining in the Bahamas. Mr. Bourke's conviction came over his role in a scheme to bribe officials in Azerbaijan over an oil investment. At Mr. Bourke's trial, tales came out of lavish trips and million-dollar shopping sprees in New York and London paid for by the investment partnership that Mr. Bourke was involved in -- the Oily Rock Group -- for Azerbaijan officials and their families, some of which were arranged by Mr. Bourke. There was also testimony about plane flights with millions of dollars stuffed into suitcases and dealings with the Chechen underworld. In his defense, Mr. Bourke said he had made no money from the scheme. In fact, he said, he actually lost $8 million. His appeal will turn on whether he was duped or simply turned a blind eye to the apparent corruption around him. He has hired a defense lawyer, Michael E. Tigar, who represented Terry Nichols in the Oklahoma City bombing case. At the Justice Department, Mr. Breuer, speaking in general terms and not about the Bourke case, sounded as if he was up for any fight. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, he said, often ensnares the wealthy. ''Some of the people we accuse are fabulously rich,'' Mr. Breuer said. ''And they are often fabulously powerful people who can get fabulous lawyers.''"7-Apr-12,COTE D'IVOIRE (95%); GABON (94%); TOGO (94%); GUINEA (94%); AFRICA (94%); WESTERN AFRICA (93%); SENEGAL (92%); MALI (92%),"Bingu wa Mutharika, an obscure economic minister who became the president of Malawi in 2004 and later brought his country to the brink of failure, died April 5 at a hospital in Blantyre, the country's commercial capital. He was 78. Physicians who treated the president confirmed to the Associated Press that he died after a heart attack. The Malawian government has issued no official statement about Mr. Mutharika's death. Reports from Malawian news media suggested that a succession struggle was imminent. A small, landlocked nation of 16 million people in southeastern Africa, Malawi has long been considered one of the world's poorest countries. During the mid-2000s, starving Malawians were known to eat grasshoppers in order to live. For a few years, Mr. Mutharika changed all of that. ""He presided over some of the most successful economic growth probably since the early 1990s,"" said Peter VonDoepp, a professor of African politics at the University of Vermont. ""The second thing he was known for was the shrinking of the democratic space and the decline of governance in the country."" A one-time World Bank economist and United Nations trade expert, Mr. Mutharika had spent much of his life beyond Malawi's borders, living in self-imposed exile during the brutal three-decade rule of Hastings Kamuzu Banda, beginning in the early 1960s. Mr. Mutharika returned to Malawi after the country's first democratic elections in 1994 and was made an economic minister in 2002 by President Bakili Muluzi. VonDoepp said that Mr. Mutharika ""came to power somewhat by accident."" After a failed effort to amend the constitution to seek a third term in office, Muluzi annointed Mr. Mutharika to succeed him. Mr. Mutharika won the multi-party election in 2004 with 35 percent of the vote. ""Because he wanted to remain top dog in the ruling party,"" VonDoepp said, ""Muluzi appointed one of his most obscure and most politically unskilled cabinet minister to serve as the party candidate for the United Democratic Front, with the idea that Mutharika would be a puppet."" But Muluzi's plans failed. Mr. Mutharika began a campaign to rid the government of corrupt officials and prosecuted members of the old regime. He courted Western officials and received hundreds of millions of dollars in aid from the United States and Britain. The president helped subsidize fertilizer supplies for Malawi's poor farmers, leading to a six-year span when the economy grew rapidly. Stocks of burley tobacco, Malawi's leading export, soared. A food shortage that had threatened millions of Malawians was reversed with a surplus of maize. Mr. Mutharika won reelection in 2009 with 66 percent of the vote. His grip on power began to weaken, however, during his second term. He became increasingly intolerant of outside critics, VonDoepp said, and passed laws that limited freedom of the press. Critics were thrown in jail. Malawi's stores of foreign currency started to disappear, which curtailed the government's ability to pay for fuel and led to shortages. The most vibrant industry was sent into turmoil when global prices of tobacco dropped. Mr. Mutharika exacerbated the mess when he refused to devalue the local currency, the kwacha, ignoring the advice of International Monetary Fund experts. The crisis reached its apogee in July 2011, when 19 demonstrators marching for reforms were killed by Malawian troops and 275 citizens were arrested. Mr. Mutharika, whose nickname was Chitsulo cha Njanji, which means ""railroad track of steel,"" vowed that he would crush the rebellion. ""I'll go after you!"" Mr. Mutharika said on state-run television. ""Even if you hide in holes, I'll smoke you out!"" Amid the turbulence, Britain froze its aid and the United States suspended a critical $350 million grant. At his death, Mr. Mutharika may be said to have improved the plight of average Malawians, but only minimally. Today, the average life expectancy is 52 years, and 11 percent of the country is infected with HIV/AIDS. Brightson Webster Ryson Thom was born Feb. 24, 1924, in the Thyolo district of what was then the British protectorate of Nyasaland. He changed his name to Bingu wa Mutharika in the 1960s after Malawi attained independence from Britain. Mr. Mutharika studied at the University of Delhi in India, where he received bachelor's and master's degrees in economics. He claimed to have received a doctorate in economics from Pacific Western University in Los Angeles. In 2004, a Government Accountability Office report concluded that Pacific Western was a ""diploma mill"" that charged a ""flat fee for a degree.""          Mr. Mutharika worked for the United Nations from 1978 to 1990 before becoming secretary general of Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, a trade group. He was dismissed in 1997, however, after the group found that Mr. Mutharika lacked ""the vision to take COMESA into the next century."" Back in Malawi, he became a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank before his appointment to Muluzi's cabinet. His first wife, Ethel Mutharika, died in 2007. Survivors include his second wife, Callista Chimombo, a former tourism minister, and four children from his first marriage. As president, Mr. Mutharika lived in a 300-room palace built by the dictator Banda. In 2010, he became chairman of the African Union, succeeding Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi, who called Mr. Mutharika ""my brother."" shapirot@washpost.com  'All sorts of improprieties'GSA Inspector General Brian Miller, above, said he is looking into possible bribery and kickbacks.

D1 New parliament in Somalia falls far short of U.N. goal  MOGADISHU, Somalia - Somalia's chief justice swore in 211 new members of parliament Monday, an accomplishment that fell far short of U.N. hopes that the Horn of Africa nation would seat a full 275-member parliament that would choose a new president. Monday - the last day of eight years of Somalia's U.N.-backed Transitional Federal Government - was the day by which the United Nations repeatedly said a new president would be in place. But political bickering, violent threats and seat-buying schemes delayed progress, guaranteeing that the day would come and go with no new leader in place. Somalia has seen much progress in the year since al-Shabab militants were forced out of Mogadishu. Businesses in the capital are thriving, and sports and the arts have returned. Politics, however, remain ugly, as they were in 1991 when the last legitimate president was ousted and the country spiraled into bloody chaos. The International Crisis Group said the recent process for selecting a parliament has been as undemocratic as the Transitional Federal Government structure it is to replace, ""with unprecedented levels of political interference, corruption and intimidation."" Somali elders were tasked with naming a parliament, since no election could be held amid the shaky security across the country. A technical committee disqualified several nominees. ""Some elders allegedly nominated uneducated and objectionable individuals, some sold seats to highest bidders, and others even nominated their own family members,"" the International Crisis Group said. Few of the allegations will surprise the international backers - the United Nations, United States and European Union- heavily involved in the political process. A report written for the United Nations and released in June said the last government was rife with corruption. It allegedly protected a notorious pirate leader and deposited only $3 of every $10 received into state coffers. A report commissioned by the World Bank and published in May found that 68 percent of transitional government revenue in 2009-10 was unaccounted for. Monday's swearing-in ceremony was moved to the highly protected airport at the last minute, after incoming members of parliament asked for increased security. Somali police officers and African Union troops patrolled the area around the airport, which adjoins an A.U. military base and is the most secure location in the city. - Associated Press Summer of Siege For West Africa As Discontent Boils Into Street  DAKAR, Senegal -- Tear gas fired on hundreds of demonstrators in Togo. Mass arrests of protesters in Guinea. Guerrilla assaults against police officers and soldiers in Ivory Coast. Rock- and bottle-throwing antigovernment militants suppressed with force in Gabon. It has been a hot summer in the capitals of Africa's west coast. Authority has been challenged -- in the streets, by ambush at night, with stones or guns in broad daylight -- and the governments have struck back with their customary heavy hand. Regardless of whether those governments are considered legitimate by outside observers and governments, as in the case of Guinea and Ivory Coast, or suspect, as with Togo and Gabon, it has been a summer of siege. Political evolution on the continent's western side is often a series of eruptions: order appears to be established, and then the volcano explodes again. In Togo and Gabon, the levers of power have long seemed immutable, dominated by the same families for decades. In Guinea and Ivory Coast, both on the mend after years of upheaval, democratic order seemed to arrive at last only recently. But all of these nations bubble with uncertainty beneath the surface. Western donors and officials who visit the West African capitals to offer congratulations on stability -- the new World Bank president was in Abidjan, the Ivorian commercial capital, last week -- should be warned: their compliments may be premature. Legitimacy, it turns out, is not conferred from the outside. Witness the disaster of Mali. Its government collapsed like a house of cards earlier this year to the shock of complacent outsiders, who had hailed the country as a democratic exemplar. But it fell to knowing nods from Malians, who had long considered it too corrupt to stand. All four of this summer's other hot spots illustrate a persistent undercurrent of political life on the continent's west side: where there are internal doubts about legitimacy, stability is an illusion. Protesters and rioters will go into the street, and armed men will carry out nighttime attacks, whether Western embassies approve of the governments in place or not. Add to this a big dose of income inequality -- Africa is woefully lopsided, belying the souped-up African growth rates trumpeted by development banks and publicists -- and volatility is all but guaranteed. This year's season of low-intensity political violence has called into question that rosy growth narrative. Guinea is a particularly troubling example of the region's summer of trouble. In 2010, it managed a legitimate presidential election, its first ever, after more than 50 years of authoritarian oppression. A veteran leader of the opposition, Alpha Cond, a man imprisoned and exiled by the country's longtime tyrants, was elected in a vote judged fair. And yet late last month, his police officers were rounding up dozens of demonstrators, firing tear gas into the house of a political opponent, shooting live ammunition at protesters in the capital's ramshackle neighborhoods, and beating and arresting them. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights denounced the ''excessive force'' used by Mr. Cond's police. In one case, the police fired on a bulletproof car carrying the top opposition leaders, the leaders said. Mr. Cond's country could no longer be considered exemplary. What happened? The opposition suspects him of wanting to rig much-postponed legislative elections. The machinery of the election, critical in countries with no democratic tradition, was thought to be in the hands of a Cond ally. Memories of ethnic persecution simmered. The election date has been repeatedly pushed back and in place of a Parliament there is a ''National Transitional Council,'' nearly two years after Mr. Cond's election. The 2010 election that had appeared to bestow legitimacy did so only partly. The underlying problems -- weak institutions, ethnic hatred, brutal security forces -- were not resolved by the vote. That good-conduct medal granted from the outside had little meaning to the people of a country just nine from the bottom on the United Nations' Human Development Index, where deadly cholera is a regular summer visitor because of the near-total absence of sanitation in the capital's poor districts. The same questions of internal legitimacy are true in Ivory Coast. President Alassane Ouattara, a former top International Monetary Fund official, won his election legitimately but had to be installed by force, with the aid of the French military, after a short but bloody civil war in which some 3,000 died. Yet nearly half the country voted for Mr. Ouattara's opponent, Laurent Gbagbo, and that half has not forgotten either him or the role of the French in his downfall. Mr. Gbagbo, who had dug himself in and refused to accept the election result, is in jail awaiting trial for crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court. Substantial numbers of his fellow citizens agree with neither those accusations nor Mr. Ouattara's right to govern. Over the last month, attacks on Mr. Ouattara's soldiers and others have killed around 20, sharply rattling a fledgling government that has been piling up congratulatory handshakes for righting what was once the region's strongest economy. On Aug. 16, just outside Abidjan, attackers went after a police station as well as a military camp, killed three civilians and freed dozens of inmates from a prison. Mr. Ouattara's government blamed what remains of Mr. Gbagbo's political party for the attacks and promptly went about arresting some of its top officials. The party denied it and accused the Ouattara camp of torturing those it had arrested. Outtara officials have labeled the party ''terrorists.'' A national reconciliation commission has been moribund. Whatever his rightful claim to legitimacy in the eyes of outsiders, Mr. Ouattara is still far from a similar standing with many of his countrymen. Where legitimacy has been questioned from the outset, leaders can expect trouble. That series of events has been playing out for weeks in the small coastal nation of Togo, where antigovernment demonstrators have repeatedly filled the streets of the capital, Lom. The police fired tear gas at hundreds of them last week, just as they had the week before. As in Guinea, the demonstrators of Save Togo fear that coming parliamentary elections will be rigged. The women of Save Togo have even called for a national sex strike. The country has been run by the same family for more than 40 years. When the dictator Gen. Gnassingb Eyadma died after 38 years in power in 2005, the military put his son Faure Gnassingb in power. Not surprisingly, he won a dubious election later that year -- a victory accompanied by the deaths of nearly 800 protesters and the flight across borders of thousands more, according to Togolese human rights groups -- and again in 2010. This year's demonstrators, inspired partly by the Arab Spring, appear to have reason to mistrust elections managed by the ruling clan. ''We're asking for a radical change in our country,'' said Jil-Benot Afangbedji, a lawyer who helps run Save Togo. ''We want to establish a nation truly founded on laws, one that respects the rights of men.'' The protesters are unlikely to force the president from office, said the leading Togolese political scientist, Comi Toulabor. And yet ''the government has been weakened'' because of them, he said. In Gabon, the situation is similar: violent protests against a family, the Bongos, that has ruled the small-scale petrostate for more than 40 years. Even if Ali Bongo really won the election to succeed his father in 2009, his legitimacy has been questioned from the start, simply because of his last name. The police broke up a protest spearheaded by a returning opposition leader with tear gas two weeks ago, the most violent outbreak since postelection riots in 2009. Moreover, the unrest seems unlikely to go away, for a basic reason. ''The Togolese are not eating three times a day,'' Mr. Afangbedji said. ''The authorities are deaf to our demands. But we are not going to shut up.''"30-Dec-12,SOUTH AFRICA (96%),"Dan Gertler's bearded face lights up as he looks out the helicopter window. Below, an installation rises from a clearing in the central African forest, where it transforms ore mined from the ochre earth into sheets of copper. ""Look at it, look at it,"" the Israeli billionaire, 38, shouts through the headset. ""This is what life is all about,"" Gertler says as the chopper lands in the scorching  afternoon heat of the Democratic Republic of Congo. ""Everyone comes with dreams and illusions and promises. Everyone wants quick deals. They don't want to invest. We are real."" Gertler hops out into the dust of Mutanda, a mine controlled by his partner, Glencore International, that holds cobalt and some of the highest-grade copper in the world. He climbs into a Toyota Land Cruiser to tour the mine, tapping messages into one of three BlackBerrys, whose batteries, like those of most smartphones and laptops, often depend on cobalt to keep their charge. Gertler has stakes in companies that control 9.6 percent of world cobalt production. That's just the beginning of his influence in Congo, the largest country of sub-Saharan Africa, with the world's richest deposits of cobalt and major reserves of copper, diamonds, gold, tin and coltan, an ore containing the metal tantalum that is used in consumer electronics. His Gibraltar-registered Fleurette Properties owns stakes in various Congolese mines through at least 60 holding companies in offshore tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands. Gertler, whose grandfather co-founded Israel's diamond exchange in 1947, arrived in Congo in 1997 seeking rough diamonds. The 23-year-old trader struck a friendship with Joseph Kabila, who then headed the Congolese army and today is the nation's president. Since those early days, Gertler has invested in iron ore, gold, cobalt and copper as well as agriculture, oil and banking. In the process, he's built a net worth of at least $2.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Roster of critics He's also acquired a roster of critics. Many of the government's deals with Gertler deprive Congo's 68 million people of badly needed funds, according to the London-based anticorruption group Global Witness and lawmakers from Congo and Britain, the country's second-biggest aid donor after the United States. ""Dan Gertler is essentially looting Congo at the expense of its people,"" said Jean Pierre Muteba, the head of a group of nongovernmental organizations that monitor the mining sector in Katanga province, with most of Congo's copper. ""He has political connections, so state companies sell him mines for low prices and he sells them on for huge profits. That's how he's become a billionaire."" In the eight months preceding the November 2011 elections, in which Kabila won a second five-year term, companies affiliated with Gertler bought shares in five mining ventures from three state-owned firms, according to minutes of board meetings, company filings and documents published later. The state companies didn't announce the sales. In some cases, prices paid were below valuations of the projects made by analysts at Deutsche Bank, Numis Securities and Oriel Securities. Gertler said he did not buy companies at below-market rates or engage in kickbacks. ""The lies are screaming to the heavens,"" he said in his native Hebrew during three days Bloomberg reporters spent with him in Congo and Israel. He returns home to Bnei Brak, an ultra-Orthodox suburb of Tel Aviv, each week to spend the Sabbath with his wife, Anat, and nine children. Congo has a history of making deals out of the public view. The International Monetary Fund has halted a $532 million loan program with the country. It said the government didn't adhere to its demand to publish the full details of a 2011 mining deal between a state-owned miner and a company that reportedly is affiliated with Gertler. Congo will lose out on three loan disbursements worth about $225 million, according to Oscar Melhado, the IMF's resident representative in Congo. As the country's mineral wealth is developed, the lot of Congo's people isn't improving. Congo remains the world's most destitute nation, according to the U.N. Development Programme. Most of the country lives without electricity or running water, and one in five children dies before his or her fifth birthday. Kabila's reelection was marred by irregularities, according to observers. Kabila's opponent, Etienne Tshisekedi, contested the 49 to32 percent vote, charging it was fraudulent. The Congolese Supreme Court ruled it valid. Global Witness has called on Glencore and FTSE 100 Index-listed Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. (ENRC), two companies involved in the pre-election deals with Gertler, to publish details of the transactions and dispel the anti-corruption group's suspicions that Congolese officials received kickbacks for selling assets to Gertler. ""Offering, paying, authorizing, soliciting or accepting bribes is unacceptable to Glencore,"" spokesman Charles Watenphul said. The ENRC declined to comment. Gertler said disclosing the deals to the public is the Congolese government's responsibility. ""We're a private company. Why should we announce?"" he said. ""I should get a Nobel Prize,"" added Gertler, who paced and waved his arms as his demeanor swung between anger and charm. ""They need people like us, who come and put billions in the ground. Without this, the resources are worth nothing."" 'Braved the hurricane' The government insists it's following the rules of the IMF agreement, which calls for it to disclose deals for its natural resources. And Kabila, 41, defends Gertler as a man who staked his fortune on Congo at a time when the country was wracked by war and desperate for cash. ""The truth is, during our very difficult times, there were investors who came and left and others who braved the hurricane,"" he said of Gertler at his riverside palace in December 2011. ""He's one of those."" The bond between the two men is so strong that Kabila at times uses Gertler as a special diplomatic envoy, including in 2002, when the Israeli businessman met with then-U.S. national security adviser Condoleezza Rice to ask for help ending Congo's war with its neighbors. Diamonds have been a backdrop to Gertler's life since his childhood in affluent northern Tel Aviv, where he had a secular upbringing. His mother ran a pop-music radio station, and his father was a goalkeeper for Maccabi Tel Aviv, a top-division pro soccer team, before becoming a diamond dealer. As a youth, Gertler got up at 5 a.m. to learn how to polish gems before heading to school. He joined his grandfather, Romanian emigre Moshe Schnitzer, at business meetings to watch him negotiate diamond deals. When Schnitzer died in 2007, Benjamin Netanyahu,  now Israel's prime minister, gave a eulogy. Gertler recalled a business lesson his grandfather imparted: ""He told me: 'Dan, you meet your bankers and you ask for credit only when you don't need it. Just to secure it. Because when you need it, it is too late.'_"" Gertler said he started buying rough diamonds at age 22, so he could work with larger volumes. Gertler flew between war-torn nations such as Liberia and Angola and the major diamond centers in the United States, India and Israel, buying and selling gems, he said. ""From the beginning, he went his own way,"" says his uncle, Shmuel Schnitzer, 63, former president of the World Federation of Diamond Bourses.""The guy has guts."" Gertler broke with his family's secular tradition when he and Anat decided to adopt an ultra-Orthodox lifestyle. They've banned television and computers from their five-story, terraced house. In Congo, he supports the Chabad-Lubavitch center, which provides religious and educational services to Jews throughout Africa. Gertler's love affair with Congo began in 1997, when the country was one of the world's top five producers of diamonds. That May, insurgents led by Laurent Kabila, the father of the current president, overthrew the corrupt regime of Mobutu Sese Seko, a U.S. ally who had ruled for 32 years. After taking Kinshasa on May 17, Laurent Kabila declared himself president and renamed the country Democratic Republic of Congo. A few days later, Shlomo Bentolila, chief rabbi of Kinshasa's Chabad-Lubavitch center, arranged for the young diamond merchant to meet Kabila's son Joseph, the new army chief, at the InterContinental hotel, Gertler said. The two clicked, he recalled. Both carried a heavy responsibility: Kabila was the commander of thousands of troops, and Gertler was trading $2 billion of diamonds annually, he said. One day, Kabila suggested that Gertler meet the president. Laurent needed money to fight his war and offered Gertler a monopoly on Congo's diamond sales, he said. Kabila asked for $20 million in cash. Gertler agreed. He was back in Israel celebrating the deal when the Congolese president called. He needed the money immediately. Using a mix of bank credit, inheritance, cash reserves and liquidated stocks, Gertler said he scraped together the payment and sent it to the Swiss account of Congo's central bank. Gertler had bet his fortune on a president at war. The risks became evident in January 2001, when a bodyguard shot Laurent Kabila dead and his son took power. Role as envoy The young president needed friends: When he took over, vast swaths of the country were under the control of rebel factions backed by Uganda and Rwanda. Kabila asked Gertler to help woo U.S. support to bolster his position as leader and start peace talks with his neighbors. In April 2002, Gertler said, he secretly shuttled between Washington, Kinshasa and Kigali, Rwanda, relaying letters between Kabila and Rice. Jendayi Frazer, a former special assistant to President George W. Bush, said Gertler's intervention was instrumental to talks that resulted in a peace accord. ""He was serious and credible,"" Frazer said. By the time the peace deal was signed between the government and rebel factions in 2002, millions had died in Congo. Gertler won back a near monopoly of Congo's diamond trade. One of his companies, Emaxon Finance International, paid $15 million in cash and loans to the country's state-owned diamond miner, known as MIBA, for a four- year contract to sell 88 percent of its production. Congo was desperate for investment, Frazer said. ""It's not like he crowded out a lot of other investors,"" she said. ""There weren't many."" Kabila, who had formed a government in which former rebel chiefs were cabinet ministers as part of the peace deal, tried to kick-start Congo's economy. The ministers signed deals to exploit the country's natural resources with foreign companies, many of them at prices that undervalued the assets, the World Bank said. In 2006, Kabila's People's Party for Reconstruction and Development, with a platform of rebuilding the country's infrastructure, was elected in Congo's first free elections in four decades. The backroom deals continued, said Peter Rosenblum, a professor of law at Columbia University who headed the Carter Center's mission to observe the mining review. ""What happened in 2008 and 2009 really proved that the Gertlers of the world would win by doing business the way they'd been doing it all along,"" Rosenblum said. Today, Transparency International ranks only a dozen countries below Congo in its Corruption Perceptions Index. As Kabila cemented his hold on power, Gertler expanded beyond diamonds into mining of other minerals and metals. Charm and aggression Six mining executives who have done business with Gertler say he mixes charm and aggressiveness to make deals. During negotiations, which are often in French - a language Gertler only partially understands - he will hunch over his BlackBerry, seemingly oblivious to the debate, said Pieter Deboutte, the Belgian who runs Gertler's business in Congo. Then, suddenly, he'll catch everyone off guard by interjecting, ""Stop, wait a bit!"" and launch into a list of orders in English to his staff. Gertler's dealings can be wildly profitable. In one case, he earned a 500 percent return in six months without risking a penny as the middleman in a deal for SMKK, which owns a copper and cobalt deposit in Katanga's richest mining zone. Gertler said it's not his fault if the government didn't get a good price for its SMKK holding. ""That is what we know how to do better than anyone else: We know how to maximize value for our projects,"" he said. ""If the government would like to hire my services to maximize value for their stake, they should approach me. No problem."" Copper is what attracts most miners to Congo, with one of the world's biggest reserves, Gertler said. The metal traded at $7,991 a ton in London on Dec. 5, more than double its price on Jan. 5, 2009. In June 2010 and March 2011, state-owned miner Sodimico sold more than 30 mining licenses, including those for two copper projects, to Gertler-linked companies for $60 million. The two projects were estimated to be worth $1.6 billion, though their valuations included ore-processing plants and the licenses. Laurent chief executive Lambert Tshisola Kangoa, said the mines ministry demanded Sodimico give $10 million to the country's general election fund. ""It was not an economic decision by Sodimico,"" he said of the sale. Gertler's joint venture relinquished the rights to the biggest of the mines, Frontier, according to the mines ministry. In July 2012, Congo sold the ENRC the license for Frontier, which in 2009 had been the country's biggest taxpayer, for $101.5 million. ""When you see similar things with slightly different variations happening again and again, you have to stop and think, 'Obviously something is going wrong,'_"" said Daniel Balint-Kurti, chief researcher at Congo for Global Witness. At the Mutanda project, too, Gertler paid far less for his 20 percent than his partner, Glencore International, paid for similar assets. Glencore's outside consulting firm valued the entire mine at about $3 billion. Based on net present value calculations using figures from Glencore's May 2011 prospectus, Gertler's stake, including royalties and other payments, was worth $849 million at the time. One of Gertler's British Virgin Islands-based companies bought the stake from Gecamines for $120 million in March 2011, according to a copy of the contract. About a year later, in May 2012, Glencore paid $340 million, plus $140 million in assumed debt, for 20 percent of the mine, increasing its holding to 60 percent. Gertler says Glencore's 20 percent purchase was worth more than his because it gave them control of the company. Gertler said he will stick by Congo. ""I took a decision that I wanted to be a long-term player in Congo,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, yes, I'm looking to create a lot of wealth."" Gertler dismissed critics who say he's amassed a fortune at the expense of the world's poorest people. ""Our deals and performance speak for themselves,"" he said. ""And whoever doesn't feel comfortable investing with us will not."" - Bloomberg Markets The full version of this Bloomberg Markets article appears in the January issue. South African Who Battled Apartheid Forms Party  JOHANNESBURG -- Mamphela Ramphele, a respected veteran of the struggle against apartheid, announced on Monday that she had formed a new political party to compete against the governing African National Congress, calling on South Africans to ''join me on a journey to build the country of our dreams.'' The party is called Agang, a Sotho word meaning ''build.'' In recent years, Dr. Ramphele, 65, a medical doctor who became an anti-apartheid activist and a leader of the Black Consciousness Movement, has focused on social activism and business. Until last week, she served as the chairwoman of Gold Fields, a major mining company. The new party is the latest in a string of challengers to the dominance of the A.N.C., which has handily won every national election since apartheid ended in 1994 but has come under increasing scrutiny over charges of corruption and poor governance. In addition, inequality has grown in South Africa since the end of apartheid, despite the party's pledge to bring ''a better life for all.'' The country's education system is a shambles. Dr. Ramphele forcefully argued to an audience at the old Women's Jail in Johannesburg that the government had failed to deliver, and she vowed to tackle corruption head on. ''The country of our dreams has unfortunately faded,'' she said in her speech. ''The dream has faded for the many living in poverty and destitution in our increasingly unequal society. And perhaps worst of all, my generation has to confess to the young people of our country: We have failed you. We have failed to build for you an education and training system to prepare you for life in the 21st century.'' That refrain echoes the criticisms from other opposition parties, including the Democratic Alliance, the main opposition party. It was reported to have courted Dr. Ramphele, seeking to put a prominent and well-respected black leader atop what is still perceived as a largely white party, despite its gains in urban black townships. In an interview, Dr. Ramphele said she had opted to start her own movement because South Africa needed a fresh start. ''The country needs a new beginning,'' she said, dressed in an embroidered traditional outfit from her home state, Limpopo. ''It is not going to happen with the current players.'' Dr. Ramphele has been a fixture in South African public life for decades. She had a close relationship with the Black Consciousness activist Steve Biko, who died in police custody in 1977, having two children with him. The apartheid government banished her for seven years to the village of Lenyenye, in a bleak northern corner of the country, for her political activism. Undeterred, she started a small clinic that treated thousands of rural residents. She also earned degrees in anthropology and business. When apartheid ended, she was named vice chancellor of the University of Cape Town, the first black person to hold the post. She later became a managing director of the World Bank, and in recent years she has been sought after as a corporate board member. Though her career has given her sterling international credentials, it remains to be seen whether she can muster a mass following in a country where populist appeal has proved essential to political success. Asked about the size of her team, she responded that ''we are an energetic team of five.'' Hobnobbing with corporate titans and global leaders has left Dr. Ramphele open to charges of elitism, some say. Bantu Holomisa, the leader of the United Democratic Movement, which he started after leaving the A.N.C. in 1997, said in a statement that he welcomed Dr. Ramphele to politics and signaled a willingness to join forces. ''We look forward to working with Dr. Ramphele in our efforts to build a strong political alternative for the people of South Africa,'' he said. But efforts to blunt A.N.C. dominance have struggled in the past. The Congress of the People, a breakaway party started in 2008 by supporters of former President Thabo Mbeki and other disgruntled A.N.C. members, has had its power wane. The A.N.C. has been rocked by scandal and tragedy over the past year. President Jacob Zuma has faced repeated investigations over $27 million in government money spent on security upgrades to his private residence in his home village of Nkandla. The killing of 33 striking workers by the police at a platinum mine in August caused many to question the A.N.C.'s commitment to helping the poor. The crisis led credit agencies to slash the country's debt rating, which has hurt economic growth."14-Apr-13,SIERRA LEONE (94%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%),"FREETOWN, Sierra Leone -- The health statistics in this battered land, still scarred from a decade of civil war, are so alarming that for a decade, donors have opened their wallets to help improve some of the world's worst rates of maternal and infant mortality. This is the third-most dangerous place on earth to have a baby, and one of the most perilous to be a baby. Millions of donor dollars later, health statistics show that the ''crisis'' for mothers and babies, as the British government called it, may be lessening. But one crisis appears to have spawned another: In a place where most of the population lives on less than a dollar a day, the incoming rush of health care aid has been dazzling. Too dazzling, apparently. Last month, the country's 29 top health officials found themselves indicted by Sierra Leone's anticorruption agency on charges of misappropriating a half-million dollars in grants from a global vaccine provider, GAVI Alliance, started by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The amount may not seem huge in some places, but in Sierra Leone, one of the least developed nations in the world, it looms particularly large, and the list of suspects is stunning. The country's top doctor -- the chief medical officer, Dr. Kizito Daoh -- was among those indicted. So were the director of primary health care at the Health Ministry, the permanent secretary at the Health Ministry and the ministry's program manager for reproductive health. Much of the ministry's leadership, the key agency in tackling some of the continent's worst health outcomes, now finds itself charged with wrongdoing, including eight doctors. ''You have a ministry without a head,'' said the World Bank representative here, Francis Ato Brown. ''It's virtually decapitated the ministry,'' he said of the indictments, adding that they had ''the potential to virtually destroy the health care system.'' The officials took money from the vaccine funds to hold workshops and training seminars, for instance -- and then could not prove that these sessions had been held, officials say. But that may have been just a piece of the problem. Investigators say they have found evidence of large houses and expensive cars not consistent with official salaries, as well as kickbacks from suppliers. The vaccine alliance froze about $4.2 million in coming grants in November, as a country that had been a poster child for health care projects -- Britain and others have financed a free health care program for mothers and children that has reduced malaria rates -- suddenly became a cautionary tale. Investigators have found nurses illegally selling drugs to patients in the free care program and doctors charging for services that were, according to the donor terms, supposed to be free. Government auditors have found tens of thousands of dollars withdrawn from an internationally financed maternal and child health program, with no records for how the money was spent; at hospitals in the interior, and at the central medical store in Freetown, they have found no records to support the dispensing of drugs worth thousands of dollars; and they could not find records for 23 of the Health Ministry's 55 bank accounts. Record-keeping has been ''abysmal,'' an anticorruption investigator wrote in a report. The vaccine alliance first noticed problems in an internal review. And last week i t released an audit report that found tens of thousands of dollars in unjustified uses of finances and cash withdrawals, ambulances for which the Health Ministry paid almost twice as much as it should, and over a dozen motorcycles improperly distributed. The audit showed ''very high exposure of this grant to misuse,'' the report concluded. But Sierra Leone officials themselves, including the Anti-Corruption Commission and the auditor general, are the ones who are sounding alarms, motivated by the knowledge that outside aid represents 20 percent of national income. ''There is evidence of cash withdrawals, and we haven't seen what's been done with the cash,'' said Joseph F. Kamara, the head of the Anti-Corruption Commission, whose headquarters are in an old church office building next to the Anglican cathedral downtown. ''They were claiming money for supervising work that was never done.'' ''We've seen a pattern,'' the misappropriation of health funds, ''clearly being replicated elsewhere,'' he said. Mr. Kamara has 161 people working for him, and they clamber up and down the narrow stairs of the old church building in this sweltering seaside capital. On the worn wooden door of his office is a sticker in the local Krio language exhorting that ''corruption must be talked about.'' The charges against the country's top physicians have also shocked the public in Sierra Leone. ''There's a perception that doctors are meant to heal wounds, not bleed them,'' Mr. Kamara said. His predecessor obtained a corruption conviction against the former health minister, Sheiku Koroma. Health care ''is an area that has long been corrupt,'' said Abdul Tejan-Cole, the former anticorruption commissioner, who resigned three years ago after receiving threats. Top doctors, including at the Health Ministry, ''refuse to go to the hospital'' because ''it's much more lucrative to manage a donor project,'' Mr. Tejan-Cole said. ''Across the board in public-sector funds, a lot is going wrong. There's a lot of misappropriation and abuse.'' Dr. Daoh, the chief medical officer who has been indicted, was sitting on the patio of his two-story house reading the Koran on a recent Saturday afternoon. He complained that the government kept putting off his day in court and said that ''nobody has asked my side of the story,'' before declining to comment. The anticorruption chief, Mr. Kamara, boasted about the speed with which he had obtained indictments, but doubts have been raised about whether they will hold up, and whether the volume of indictments was intended primarily to impress donors. ''The indictments were hurriedly done,'' said a knowledgeable former top government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Nonetheless, even the official, who was critical of Mr. Kamara, agreed that a crime had been committed with the missing vaccine funds. ''We can describe this as a reversal of a moral ethos,'' Mr. Kamara said. The doctors ''should have been there for the victims, but it turns out that they are the perpetrators of the victims' predicament.'' ''It introduces a state of hopelessness in health security,'' he added. ''You have nowhere to turn to.''"28-Jul-13,UNITED STATES (94%); AUSTRALIA (79%); KENYA (79%),"A soldier in olive fatigues pulled Hope Masters into a corrugated metal trailer, locked the door and dropped the key on the floor. He reeked of chewing tobacco and beer. ""Como se llama?"" he asked Masters, who barely understands Spanish. He moved closer, backing her into a corner of the checkpoint guard station at the edge of Sipopo, outside the capital of Equatorial Guinea. There were no chairs, only a grubby woolen blanket on a shipping pallet and a bare light bulb hanging from the ceiling. There was no doorknob on the inside. ""Como se llama?"" Masters shifted her weight from one boot to the other, trying to ease the pain in her blistered feet. At 5-foot-11, she towered over the guard. He was in his mid-20s, almost half her age, and his teeth were rotting. But he was the one with a gun. In English, Masters tried to explain how her driver was late to pick her up from a grocery store in Malabo, so she decided to walk back five miles to the lavish conference compound where she was a guest of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. Her phone was dead. She had forgotten her identification back at the villa. ""Como se llama?"" The soldier shook his head at her and clicked his tongue. With the barrel of his Kalashnikov, he pulled down the collar of her shirt. He turned and left, bolting the door behind him. Masters paced the length of the trailer - and prayed. ""I said, 'Okay, God, I get it. I pushed my luck. EG is a not a good place.' It was an awakening,"" she recalled in a recent interview. She thought of her dead father, Leon H. Sullivan. It was Sullivan, a charismatic Baptist minister who had devoted his life to social justice in Africa, whose legacy she carried as president of the foundation that bore his name. It was his memory that had brought her to Equatorial Guinea. Sullivan had wanted to heal what he saw as a divide between Africans and African Americans. The larger-than-life figure from a poor West Virginia family came to represent the blending of business and human rights interests in Africa. His ""Sullivan Principles"" are still considered a gold standard for corporate ethics overseas. After Sullivan died in 2001, Masters's organization became the torchbearer for that vision. Ex-presidents and Beltway royalty joined. Bill Clinton was honorary co-chairman. Andrew Young became chairman of the board. Masters was in Equatorial Guinea to host the foundation's 2012 summit, a multimillion-dollar event just weeks away featuring celebrity guests and corporate sponsors. Already there was controversy: The government of Equatorial Guinea is among the longest uninterrupted dictatorships on the continent known for rampant corruption, impunity and abuses of power. And now this abusive guard, as if to prove her critics' point. After two hours, she persuaded the guard to let her open her bag and show him a newspaper photo of her with Equatorial Guinea's president. The guard released her, and the disputed summit went on. By the time it ended, Hope Masters had suffered the worst professional crisis of her life, and an esteemed nonprofit fell to ashes. But the foundation's struggles took root long before last summer's controversy. When Leon Sullivan called for boycotts in Philadelphia, or demanded unity among delegates at African summits, his speeches were pitched high, in the mold of civil rights sermons of the 1960s. In the late 1950s, he pried open doors for African American workers. He organized boycotts against companies that wouldn't hire black workers. He launched the Opportunities Industrialization Centers to train workers and get them jobs. The OIC expanded to Africa. Then, in the 1980s, he founded the International Foundation for Education and Self-Help to tackle big development barriers such as illiteracy and preventable diseases. In 1991, Sullivan held the first summit in the Ivory Coast, an event he planned from a hospital bed  because he contracted a life-threatening infection that left three fingers paralyzed. The meeting drew African governments and U.S. business leaders together, and led to dual citizenship for African Americans in the Ivory Coast. He also campaigned for debt relief from the United States and France, resulting in billions in forgiven debt for sub-Saharan Africa. Hope Masters,  the youngest of his three children, remembers tagging along as a recent law school graduate during that first summit, in awe of her father's resolve. After becoming the first African American board member of General Motors, Sullivan turned his attention to South Africa. While others called for a boycott over apartheid, Sullivan urged companies in South Africa to retain and hire black workers. As he had in Philadelphia, he focused on the creation of a black middle class through job training and education. When her father died from leukemia in 2001, Hope Masters (then Hope Sullivan), along with Andrew Young, the former U.N. ambassador and former mayor of Atlanta, launched the Leon H. Sullivan Foundation to raise money and support the nonprofits Sullivan had founded. With no training in management, Hope took up the mantle reluctantly, at the request of family advisers. Buoyed by Sullivan's reputation and Young's civil rights prestige, the new foundation pulled in high-profile support, with Clinton and other heavyweights beefing up the board, including  lawyer Johnnie Cochran, Time Warner's then-chief executive Richard Parsons, Chevron's then-chief executive David J. O'Reilly, former Federal Reserve Board member Andrew Brimmer, former secretary of transportation Rodney Slater and former secretary of labor Alexis Herman. In 2005, Hope Sullivan married one of the board members, international banker Carlton Masters, who with Young had founded GoodWorks International, a lobbying firm that represents U.S. business and congressional interests for African clients such as Angola, Benin and Tanzania. Equatorial Guinea has never been one of the firm's clients. Masters resigned from the Sullivan Foundation board to avoid conflicts of interest with family. At its peak, just two years after its launch, the foundation reaped $5.2 million in donations, mainly from Chevron, one of the biggest investors in Africa oil production, as well as General Motors and Coca-Cola. The organization's summits carried on Leon Sullivan's vision, bringing African leaders together with potential investors and African Americans who wanted to contribute to African development. The summits were well regarded among African leaders, and took advantage of Young's and Carlton Masters's  extensive connections on the continent. The foundation scored top-shelf guests for its exclusive Beltway events. Panels and award ceremonies featured African leaders such as former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo - who hosted Hope Sullivan and Carlton Masters's wedding - Ghana's former president John Kufuor and South African President Jacob Zuma. President George W. Bush and former U.S. secretaries of state Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice also attended. In 2009, the foundation held a ceremony at the Kennedy Center that honored actress and Africa rights activist Mia Farrow, among others. Tux- and gown-resplendent guests sipped cocktails on the terrace. The next year's awards party at the Mandarin Oriental brought Stevie Wonder, with entertainment by the Temptations. Hope Masters said roundtable sessions with African presidents were meant to help the leaders share perspectives with policymakers in the developed world. The foundation also spent money on ground-level aid projects, such as a relief program with Opportunities Industrialization Centers to help women displaced in Louisiana because of Hurricane Katrina. In 2010, the Sullivan Foundation donated $22,000 to Medshare International, which distributes surplus medical supplies to areas in need. These direct-aid projects represented a small portion of the foundation's overall spending, however. By the time the foundation selected Equatorial Guinea for its 2012 summit, it had garnered a dubious reputation for its lavish parties, an image that clashed with the realities of impoverished African nations. Human rights groups were already skeptical of the foundation's goals, and other Africa-focused groups in town, competitors in the small world of D.C.'s African nonprofits, were quietly critical. Less known was that between 2003 and 2011, donations had dropped off and the foundation had spent down its entire nest egg, according to public tax filings. By 2012, coffers were drained. While spending big on public events, the organization was struggling to stay solvent. In June 2012, Hope and Carlton Masters threw a party in their Chevy Chase home using their own money, with President Obiang of Equatorial Guinea and former president Kufuor of Ghana attending. Guests were treated to valet parking and Jamaican food, nibbled poolside. Recently, Masters asked why her organization would be singled out for hosting such events, when scores of other Washington organizations hold galas to raise money and project an elite image for donors. ""We were among the first of Africanist groups to have fundraisers with that level of elegance in our home. I think it makes people uncomfortable when it's black people"" displaying wealth conspicuously, Masters said. Still, she said she should have anticipated taking heat for throwing an extravagant event while hosting Obiang, who is known for flaunting wealth. ""It was my fault for not being sensitive to those optics."" GoodWorks and her husband saved the foundation from insolvency several times. A look at 10 years of tax records shows $185,000 in loans from Masters and $175,000 from GoodWorks. The total amount was just a fraction of the foundation's yearly budgets, but some loans were granted without review of the board, a practice that, while not illegal, raises eyebrows among charity watchers. ""It gives more power and influence to the interested party because they could always threaten to pull the loan,"" said Daniel Borochoff, president of CharityWatch. Masters insists that an ""iron wall"" has always existed between the two entities' business dealings. She said the loans were paid off and they didn't influence her decisions. Thor Halvorssen, president of the Human Rights Foundation, sees a conflict. ""You cannot get a better illustration of conflicts of interests than that the Leon Sullivan Foundation operates out of the office of a group of lobbyists that have lined their pockets with the ill-gotten gains of dictatorships like Angola and Benin,"" he said. Masters said she moved into the GoodWorks office in 2011 because she could no longer afford to pay rent at the Sullivan Foundation's former office one block west on K Street. She maintains that the two entities were not intertwined financially but acknowledges that the foundation took advantage of high-level African government contacts that Carlton Masters and Andrew Young gained as part of their work with the firm. GoodWorks' lobbying disclosures reveal that a number of the firm's clients, including Nigeria and Tanzania, hosted summits for the Sullivan Foundation, using the occasion to polish images tarnished by allegations of pervasive corruption. Chevron and Coca-Cola are clients of GoodWorks and have given millions to the Sullivan Foundation. In May, Carlton Masters was appointed representative to the African Union for Jamaica, and has scaled back his role with GoodWorks. Young has retired from the company and from the Sullivan Foundation, and now focuses on his own foundation in Atlanta. Several attempts to reach him were unsuccessful. Both men have ties to the embattled Southern Africa Enterprise Development Fund, which, the New York Times recently reported, has lost 60 percent of its value since 2009 amid poor management and shady dealings. Young led the fund for many years but left it in 2012. Carlton Masters is the current chairman, and the fund is in arbitration proceedings with a management firm that says it was stiffed for $1.4 million. The fund countered with a charge that the firm's executives inappropriately overpaid themselves. Well before the Chevy Chase party, the Sullivan Foundation had come under fire for honoring Obiang as a ""champion of Africa."" Under Obiang's 34-year rule, political opposition has been quashed, oil revenue secreted away, and press freedom constrained to a vanishing point. Rich oil reserves were discovered in the 1990s, making the country one of the wealthiest nations in Africa at a per-capita GDP of about $30,000, but the money has yet to trickle down to the 736,000 people, 76.8 percent of which live under the poverty line, according to World Bank figures. In October 2011, the foundation announced plans to hand an award to Obiang, who then held the presidency of the African Union. When activists pointed out that the announcement could be interpreted to mean that Obiang, and not the African Union, was receiving the award personally, the organization dismissed the confusion as the result of a ""HORRIFYING mistake."" Two months after the ceremony, confusion continued as the Equatorial Guinean Embassy's Flickr page said, ""Obiang receives Sullivan Honor,"" and a Washington Post blogger reported that ""Dictator Obiang collects an award once given to Clinton, Bush."" The human rights group EG Justice sent a letter criticizing Obiang's inclusion in releases about the award and the Sullivan Foundation's failure to denounce human rights violations under his regime. Months later, word spread of the organization's plans to hold its annual summit in Malabo, the capital of Equatorial Guinea. Human rights groups again denounced the foundation. Masters did not respond. From a crowded office in the Empire State Building in New York, Halvorssen and his staff spent weeks preparing  a verbal assault. In a letter addressed to Masters and Young, Halvorssen called for the foundation to cancel the summit. The foundation had ""not once made reference to [Obiang's] appalling and well-documented record of corruption and human rights abuse,"" the letter said. Again, there was no response. A day later, Halvorssen's team started contacting speakers and guests directly, demanding that they cancel plans to attend. Masters finally lashed back with tweets accusing critics of  ""yellow journalism,"" lies and  racism. A radio interview with Gloria Minott on WPFW turned into a shouting match. ""In retrospect, I shouldn't have said anything,"" Masters said. Masters said her staff on the ground in Malabo had encouraged her not to read the letter, saying it would only upset her in the middle of tense summit preparations. Her public relations head, Aly Z. Ramji, had ""a policy of no interviews,"" Masters said. Ramji did not respond to requests for comment. Why did she never mention human rights abuses? ""I think I should have,"" Masters said. ""I really don't think I was trying to hide it or anything. I didn't want it to be a whole political thing."" Within days, the guest list fell to 1,000 from 4,000. VIPs abandoned ship. All of the summit's sponsors, including longtime supporter Coca-Cola, withdrew. Clinton's name as honorary co-chairman disappeared from the Web site without explanation. Masters said Clinton requested that, but on 2011 tax returns, he remained an honorary co-chairman. A press officer for Clinton said he could not comment because of the ""high volume of requests."" The conference budget was $6.7 million, and nearly half, $3 million, was to be paid by the host government, an arrangement similar to that of previous summits. But as bookings evaporated, Masters said, the government reneged on several promises, including payment on about $500,000 in hotel costs and tens of thousands of dollars for items such as printing and signage. Masters said two of her staffers, en route to fly home, were pulled off the plane and detained by bus company employees for three hours because of a disagreement over a bill for transportation. In an interview in April at her husband's K Street office, as Masters recalled her  ordeal at the checkpoint, she said she silently asked her father for forgiveness. She hoped he would understand how she had gotten in over her head. In his activism, he had made his intentions clear and stood against injustice. In Sipopo, her messages fell short of his example. She said she avoided criticizing Obiang publicly because he had signed resolutions on youth, environment and ""human consumption"" at the summit, declaring that ""ensuring and protecting human rights are imperative to the future of Africa and her people."" Masters said she saw that as a sign of change. George Ayittey, a native of Ghana and member of the Human Rights Foundation's international council, said Masters's approach to activism is rooted in American history. ""For African Americans, the solution for advancing civil rights has come from working within government. But for many black Africans, we see our government as the problem,"" Ayittey said. Masters recognized that the gulf  in perspective between her and African-born rights advocates such as Ayittey drives deep differences over whether to work with African leaders despite rights violations. ""He's right,"" she said. ""I can never understand what he went through growing up. I try, but I can't."" To pay off the organization's remaining debts, including ones to Carlton Masters, Hope has a new plan. She's talking about starting a for-profit marketing consultancy called Full Circle. Her first project will be to handle a social media campaign for a charity program sponsored by the WNBA team the Los Angeles Sparks. She was slated to join an aid trip to an orphanage in Haiti with Mission Results this month. She said it's part of her attempt to ""hit the reset button,"" for her reputation and for the focus of her work. Masters is unsure about the fate of the Sullivan Foundation or future African summits. In March, the Sullivan Foundation's Web site featured a defiant quote from Theodore Roosevelt's ""Man in the Arena"" speech, amid pictures of African children smiling at the camera: ""It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better."" Then a countdown clock marking the minutes to the foundation's rebirth wound down to zero and stuck there. Now there is a new page. The Sullivan Foundation's rights to its domain name, the page announces, appear to have lapsed.

Sullivan  's  Africa vision crashed  despite big money and big names Tensions high on eveof elections in Zimbabwe  NAIROBI - Zimbabweans will vote Wednesday in presidential and parliamentary elections that could extend the tenure of Robert Mugabe -  one of the longest-ruling autocratic leaders in modern history - to a potential 38 years. But even before the first ballot is cast, tensions are rising over allegations of fraud that could undermine the legitimacy of the vote and the likelihood of a peaceful outcome. Mugabe, 89, in office since Zimbabwe gained its independence from Britain in 1980, is seeking another five-year term as president. Critics and analysts say that his loyalists have manipulated the voting process in myriad ways to try to ensure victory. There are reports of ""ghost voters"" and hundreds of thousands of deceased people on registration lists. Voters have complained about being improperly registered or not registered at all. And human rights activists allege intimidation and interference by the government, its military and security forces in the lead-up to the elections. Underscoring the heightened tensions, Mugabe's main opponent, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, who is challenging Mugabe for a third time, accused election officials last week of throwing away votes in his favor by about 70,000 police officers and soldiers who cast ballots early. Over the weekend Tsvangirai, 61, also declared that he had no confidence in the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission's ability to conduct a legitimate vote. He warned that if official results were delayed - as they were in the disputed 2008 elections - he would break the law and announce the election outcome. Wednesday's balloting comes as the southern African nation is emerging from a crippling economic crisis. At one point, inflation had soared to more than 500 billion percent in 2008 and economic output had sunk by 45 percent between 1999 and 2008, according to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Today, even as growth has slowed in the past two years and poverty remains widespread, Zimbabweans are in far better economic shape. But many analysts fear a recurrence of economic and political instability if the election results are again disputed - as well as a fresh eruption of the violence that marred the 2008 polls. ""A return to protracted political crisis, and possibly extensive violence, is likely, as Zimbabwe holds inadequately prepared presidential, parliamentary and local elections,"" said a report by the International Crisis Group. ""Conditions for a free and fair vote do not exist. Confidence in the process and institutions is low."" Zimbabwe was once a major corn exporter that helped feed the region, but its economy plunged into recession following seizures of white-owned commercial farms in 2000 on the orders of Mugabe and his Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front party, or ZANU-PF. Agricultural output declined, and the nation was debilitated by shortages of food and fuel, despite having some of the world's largest deposits of diamonds, gold, coal and platinum. After the 2008 vote, the electoral commission took five weeks to announce the results. Those tallies showed that Tsvangirai and his Movement for Democratic Change, or MDC, had won but not secured enough votes to avoid a runoff. The MDC accused Mugabe and ZANU-PF of vote-rigging, but that did not prevent a second round of voting. Tsvangirai later pulled out of the race, declaring that Mugabe's loyalists had killed more than 200 of his supporters. To defuse the crisis, the Southern African Development Community, a regional bloc, brokered a 2009 power-sharing deal between the two rivals, leaving Mugabe as president and Tsvangirai as prime minister. The MDC took control of many of the government's economic portfolios, while ZANU-PF retained control over the security ministries. Analysts and investors widely credit Tendai Biti, an MDC stalwart who is now the finance minister, with resuscitating the economy. He abolished the Zimbabwe dollar and allowed the use of the American dollar and other strong currencies, which helped slash inflation to single digits. Since 2009, the economy has grown every year. But the coalition government had always been a shaky partnership, and now the gloves are off. On Monday, Biti, who is also the MDC's secretary general, publicly complained that the electoral commission had given only ZANU-PF access to the voter registrations lists. ""With virtually a day to go to the election, no political party in Zimbabwe, other than ZANU-PF perhaps, has got a copy of the voters' roll,"" Biti told reporters at a news conference in Harare, the capital. Election officials at the news conference declined to address the allegations. Meanwhile, at his final campaign rally Sunday, Mugabe warned Tsvangirai that he would be arrested if he followed through on his intention to announce electoral results if the electoral commission was slow to release them. ""He knows that is not allowed by law,"" Mugabe told supporters. The commission ""is the only organization that can announce election results. I can tell you in advance that if you become a lawbreaker, the police will arrest you."" The allegations of vote tampering have been unfolding for several weeks. Earlier this month, the Research and Advocacy Unit, a Harare-based nongovernmental group, found that the voters' roll contains 1 million people who are either dead or have left the country, and 116,000 people over the age of 100, among other irregularities. The government tried to ban publication of the group's report. One Web site, MyZimVote.com, says it has received several hundred complaints of voter intimidation, fraud, incorrect registrations and other irregularities ahead of the vote. And last month, Human Rights Watch released a report alleging that the Zimbabwean military and security forces have been beating and intimidating Mugabe's opponents. ""With the security forces right up to the top leaders threatening and attacking Mugabe's perceived opponents, Zimbabweans have little faith in the upcoming elections,"" said Tiseke Kasambala, Africa advocacy director for the New York-based watchdog. ""Zimbabwe's unity government is going to have to rein in the security forces and keep them out of politics if the elections are going to have any meaning."" sudarsan.raghavan@washpost.com Some scratch their heads, others smirk  As the U.S. government creaked toward a shutdown on Monday, the world looked on with a little anxiety and a lot of dismay, and some people had trouble suppressing smirks. ""To be honest, people are making a lot of jokes,"" said Justice Malala, a political commentator in South Africa. Over the years, Malala said, South Africa often has been lectured about good governance by the United States as well as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which are heavily influenced by Washington. ""They tell us, 'You guys are not being fiscally responsible,' "" Malala said. ""And now we see that they are running their country a little like a banana republic. So there is a lot of sniggering going on."" Washington's meltdown was barely a blip on the radar in much of the world on Monday. Malala said South Africans were more concerned with last week's shopping mall massacre in Nairobi, Syria topped the news in the Middle East, and the Indian news media was keeping tabs on a corruption scandal involving a politician and a cattle-feed company. Still, many analysts abroad said they were dumbfounded at the game of political chicken playing out in Washington. They worried that instability in the United States would further damage the already shaky world economy. ""It would be great if we didn't add something more onto this precarious recovery; we really don't need this,"" said Jorge Castaeda, a Mexican academic and former foreign minister. ""Everything that happens in the United States affects us directly,"" he said. ""The last thing we want right now is another problem in the United States which will make things worse in Mexico."" Criticism across the pond In Britain, there was a sense of incredulity about the looming U.S. shutdown. Some commentators worried that the chaos in Washington could damage Europe's recovery from economic crisis. Others used the moment to trash American politicians, singling out the tea party movement for most of the blame. In the Guardian newspaper, columnist Michael Cohen decried Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas as the Republican Party's ""self-made monster."" Cohen argued that Republicans had reached the ""point where Cruz's brand of crazy, heartless, morally wanton, uncompromising conservatism is now the default position of the party."" A Times of London editorial slammed President Obama along with the tea party, saying, ""An argument that is so bitter, prolonged and apparently incapable of resolution cannot but damage America's diplomatic standing."" Disbelief in Latin America In South America, where U.S. proselytizing about fiscal responsibility has rankled some countries, economists and policymakers watched the shutdown drama with disbelief. ""It's incredible, it's surrealism,"" said Jos Antonio Ocampo, a former finance minister of  Colombia. ""I had to negotiate budgets and debt ceilings in Colombia, and this situation is frankly unreal."" Ocampo said he was astonished at Republican efforts to overturn Obama's health-care law, a key factor contributing to the potential shutdown. ""I don't remember, as minister of finance of Colombia, a blackmail so absurd like the one that the U.S. government has had to face,"" said Ocampo, who spoke by phone from New York, where he teaches at Columbia University. ""This is not some small economic or political matter,"" said Ignacio Arcaya, a former Venezuelan ambassador to the United States. ""This is a question that could affect the whole world and have unseen consequences."" In Pakistan, analysts note that the country's 66-year-old national government has never had a formal shutdown, despite three coups, decades of military rule and dire economic challenges. Economist Saqib Shirani said there ""are lessons to learn"" for Pakistan from events in Washington. In a country with 12 major political parties, he said, ""there must be political consensus on economic issues, and taking the political bickering to extreme can backfire."" ""But we are good compared to the U.S. on that,"" he said. ""Major political forces here are usually able to achieve consensus."" In India, a government minister said the U.S. problems were similar to an ongoing struggle between his government and political opponents trying to block its policies. ""It's heartening to note that administrative paralysis is not unique to a particular democracy,"" said Manish Tewari, India's information and broadcasting minister. Mideast, Russia  largely mum In the Middle East, few expressed interest in a crisis seen as complex, distant and unlikely to affect the Arab world. But in a region where political strife stemming from the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings has battered economies, some analysts were sympathetic to Washington's politically driven financial woes. ""It's a political struggle that is being played out on the economy's battlefield,"" said Rashad Abdo, a finance professor at Cairo University. The U.S. crisis has received only fleeting attention in Moscow, where the Russian government is wrestling with its own budget problems. In past years, President Vladimir Putin has scolded the United States for what he has called profligate economic policies. But this time Putin has been silent. A little schadenfreude? Others seemed to take a certain measure of satisfaction from problems in the world's richest nation. German officials have frequently seized on fiscal-policy chaos in the U.S. Congress as a reason to disregard American advice about their handling of Europe's financial problems. The looming shutdown seemed only to fuel that impulse Monday, when the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper mused in an opinion column that Obama appears to have an easier time negotiating with Iran than with the tea party. The newspaper noted that Obama used the word ""respect"" after he spoke with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Friday. But, the paper said, ""Obama then mentioned a few other adversaries, which he described as extremists and arsonists. He did not mean Iran's Quds Force, but the congressmen of the right-wing tea party."" kevin.sullivan@washpost.com Anthony Faiola and Karla Adam in London; Juan Forero in Bogota; Tim Craig in Islamabad, Pakistan; Kathy Lally in Moscow; Annie Gowen and Rama Lakshmi in New Delhi; Michael Birnbaum in Berlin; and Sharaf al-Hourani in Cairo contributed to this report. Delaware, Den Of Thieves? John A. Cassara, a former special agent for the Treasury Department, is the author, most recently, of a novel, ''Demons of Gadara.''  OUTSIDE of crimes of passion, criminal activity is typically motivated by greed. As a special agent for the Treasury Department, I investigated financial crimes like money laundering and terrorism financing. I trained foreign police forces to ''follow the money'' and track the flow of capital across borders. During these training sessions, I'd often hear this: ''My agency has a financial crimes investigation. The money trail leads to the American state of Delaware. We can't get any information and don't know what to do. We are going to have to close our investigation. Can you help?"" The question embarrassed me. There was nothing I could do. In the years I was assigned to Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or Fincen, I observed many formal requests for assistance having to do with companies associated with Delaware, Nevada or Wyoming. These states have a tawdry image: they have become nearly synonymous with underground financing, tax evasion and other bad deeds facilitated by anonymous shell companies -- or by companies lacking information on their ''beneficial owners,'' the person or entity that actually controls the company, not the (often meaning"27-Jan-14,SOUTH AFRICA (97%),"If you've been a tourist or business traveler recently in Kenya, India, Guatemala or any other developing country, you probably saw uniformed guards in the stores and offices you visited or hotels where you slept. The sight of these guards is so common that their presence most likely faded into the background. But they are emblematic of a massive social transformation that is passing unnoticed: Throughout the developing world, public justice systems are being replaced with private systems of security and dispute resolution. The implications for the world's poorest people are devastating. Businesses and economic elites in developing countries left frustrated by incompetent police, clogged courts and hopelessly overburdened judges and prosecutors are increasingly circumventing these systems and buying their own protection. In India in late 2010 the private security industry already employed more than 5.5 million people - roughly four times the size of the entire Indian police force. A 2009 World Bank report showed roughly the same ratio in Kenya. The largest employer in all of Africa is a private security firm, Group4Securicor, and in Guatemala, private security forces outnumber public police 7 to 1. The repercussions extend far beyond the elites and businesses that buy safety: When protection must be purchased, the poorest are left with nothing to shield them from violence. In many developing countries, if you want to be safe, you pay to be safe. And if you can't pay to be safe - you aren't. As elites abandon the public security system, their impoverished neighbors, especially women and girls, are left relying on underpaid, under-trained, undisciplined and frequently corrupt police forces for protection and all-but-paralyzed courts for justice. This is not a small problem isolated to a single context. It is the terrifying truth of everyday life for billions of our poorest neighbors. As a U.N. commission found in 2008, a stunning 4 billion poor people live outside the protection of law. When a justice system descends into utter dysfunction, those who exploit and abuse vulnerable people may do so without fear of apprehension or prosecution. As a result, violence is an everyday threat, as much a part of what it means to be poor as being hungry, sick, homeless or jobless. World Bank data suggest that, globally, women and girls ages 15 to 44 are at greater risk of being killed or disabled by gender-based violence than by cancer, traffic accidents, malaria and war combined - with poor women and girls absorbing the vast majority of the abuse. Appallingly, for many girls in the developing world, school is the most common place where sexual violence occurs. This result cannot be attributed solely, or even primarily, to the elites' abandonment of the public justice system. For one thing, the colonial-era justice systems that linger in most of the developing world were never designed to protect the poor from common crime, nor were they meaningfully re-engineered to do so after independence. For another, trillions in aid have been provided to the developing world, but virtually nothing has been spent on improving criminal justice systems to meet the basic needs of poor people. It is perfectly rational for wealthy citizens and businesses to protect themselves and their property. But when elites, including government officials, have no stake in professional and reliable public security, it deteriorates, just like libraries and schools do when affluent families opt out of public facilities and pay for such services in the private sector. In the midst of great and worthy efforts to help the global poor build better lives, donors and development institutions have paid little attention to the painstaking work required to ensure the things that are indispensable to stopping violence: professional and accountable police; and functioning prosecutors, courts and child welfare agencies. Even with the widespread recognition that everyday violence undermines health, education and opportunity, it has been assumed that poor communities can move forward without basic law enforcement systems - a notion none of us has been willing to bet on for our own communities. The United Nations is in the process of revising the 2000 Millennium Development Goals. Although the original eight goals inspired enormous progress toward addressing poverty, the issue of violence against the poor wasn't even mentioned. It's time to add a target for providing the poor basic law enforcement protections from everyday violence. Identifying the right to safety and justice as a crucial development goal is a first step toward including those marginalized by violence and exploitation in the world's drive to end extreme poverty. For children, women and men plagued by violence as they try to climb out of poverty, it's a change that can't come soon enough. Gary A.

Merger Puts New Face on Opposition Election Bid in South Africa  LONDON -- Opponents of South Africa's governing African National Congress drew battle lines on Tuesday for national elections, announcing a merger that will give the main opposition party its first black candidate for president as it seeks a broader political legitimacy to challenge the long dominance of the A.N.C. The vote, expected in the spring, will be the first since the death of Nelson Mandela in December. The merger brought together a prominent black anti-apartheid activist, Mamphela Ramphele, and the Democratic Alliance, which has a large base among whites and a strong legacy of anti-apartheid activism. It is unclear whether Ms. Ramphele, a medical doctor, academic, business executive and former managing director of the World Bank, whose attempts at establishing her own party had foundered, can lead the Democratic Alliance to victory in the election. The A.N.C., founded in 1912, has governed South Africa since the first democratic vote after the end of apartheid in 1994. While its reputation in recent years has been stained with accusations of corruption, ineptitude and elitism, it still exerts a broad pull both as a historical repository of South African aspirations and, more recently, as a font of patronage. Ms. Ramphele's candidacy was coupled with her announcement that she was merging her fledgling party, Agang S.A., which had never gained much momentum, with the Democratic Alliance, led by Helen Zille. As a journalist for the anti-apartheid Rand Daily Mail, Ms. Zille helped expose the events in 1977 leading up to the murder by the police of Steve Biko, an emblem of black resistance to apartheid who was Ms. Ramphele's partner. Previous attempts to draw opposition figures into a coalition to challenge the A.N.C. have not dented its power. The Democratic Alliance, whose power base is in the Western Cape, has struggled against taunts from the A.N.C. that it is white-dominated and limited in its appeal. ''This is a historic moment,'' Ms. Ramphele said as the merger was announced. ''We are going to take away the excuse of race and challenge the A.N.C. to be judged on its performance. We are taking away that race card and putting it in the dustbin.'' She added: ''I believe this decision is in the best interests of South Africa as we head into turbulent waters. The death of Nelson Mandela has changed many things for South Africa.'' Ms. Zille called the announcement a ''game-changing moment.'' But Gwede Mantashe, the A.N.C.'s secretary general, dismissed the maneuver, calling it a ''rent a black'' and a ''rent a leader'' ploy by the Democratic Alliance. Some political analysts said Ms. Ramphele could be gambling her credentials by embracing the Democratic Alliance. The group controls fewer than 17 percent of Parliament's 400 seats, while the A.N.C. accounts for two-thirds. Opponents of the A.N.C. have been encouraged by signs of the unpopularity of President Jacob Zuma that surfaced when a crowd booed him during a memorial to Mr. Mandela last month. Opposition strategists seemed to be hoping that Ms. Ramphele could inject new life into the Democratic Alliance's efforts to whittle away the majority that the A.N.C. has had for years. In recent years, the Democratic Alliance has worked assiduously to shed its largely white and mixed-race image, choosing up-and-coming black politicians as leaders in Parliament and in some provinces, and appealing to urban black voters fed up with poor government services. Almost two decades after South Africa's first democratic elections following Mr. Mandela's release from 27 years in prison, many black South Africans live in shanties and bleak townships haunted by joblessness, deprivation, poor education and crime. At the same time, the country has one of the world's sharpest divides between rich and poor. While moderate opponents like the Democratic Alliance are seeking to erode his support, Mr. Zuma also faces a more radical challenge from Julius Malema, a former leader of the A.N.C. Youth League and a onetime ally of Mr. Zuma's who is seeking to build an insurgent constituency that could further splinter opposition to the A.N.C."29-Jan-14,"AFRICA (95%); UGANDA (94%); GHANA (93%); ETHIOPIA (92%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (92%); RWANDA (79%); ERITREA (79%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%)","Opposition groups merge ahead of vote In advance of elections expected sometime this year, South Africa's main opposition party merged with a smaller group Tuesday to jointly challenge a ruling party whose immense popularity, buoyed by its anti-apartheid credentials and close ties to Nelson Mandela, has frayed amid corruption scandals and other problems. In a racially charged barb, the ruling African National Congress said the new coalition's choice of presidential candidate was a ""rent-a-black"" ploy to present a diverse front to voters. The candidate is Mamphela Ramphele, who was the partner of Steve Biko, the Black Consciousness leader who was tortured and died in police custody in 1977. Ramphele, who has been an activist, doctor, academic and World Bank executive, last year formed her own party, named ""Agang,"" or ""Build"" in the Sesotho language, but struggled to gain political momentum and now has linked her group with the larger Democratic Alliance party.

A courtroom reunion of the two alleged chief architects of Serb atrocities during Bosnia's 1992-95 war lasted just an hour as Mladic repeatedly told judges he would not answer former Bosnian Serb president Karadzic's questions, citing ill health and an unwillingness to risk incriminating himself.

Mr. Museveni, like Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia, had come to office through the barrel of a gun, a depressingly familiar means of gaining power in Africa during the first three decades of independence. But after ending a cycle of murderous rule by despots steeped in human rights abuses and financial corruption, the young leaders proved to be different from their predecessors. Both introduced rational governance structures, presided over economic turnarounds and brought much-needed stability to their countries. ''One hundred years from now your grandchildren and mine will look back and say this was the beginning of an African renaissance,'' Mr. Clinton said in Accra, Ghana, in March 1998, praising a ''new generation'' of African leaders that -- along with Mr. Meles and Mr. Museveni -- included Isaias Afewerki of Eritrea, Paul Kagame of Rwanda, Jerry Rawlings of Ghana and Thabo Mbeki of South Africa. But Mr. Clinton spoke too soon. If one of the greatest tests of revolutionaries is their capacity to voluntarily give up power, Mr. Museveni and Mr. Meles (who died in office in 2012) proved to be cut from a different cloth from such illustrious statesmen as Nelson Mandela and Tanzania's Julius Nyerere, justly celebrated for resisting the temptation to be presidents for life. Or, for that matter, from Mr. Mbeki, who stepped down in 2008 after losing a battle for leadership of the African National Congress, and Mr. Rawlings, who relinquished his office in 2001, thus becoming the first leader in African history who had seized power by force to yield peacefully to the democratic process. Mr. Afewerki and Mr. Kagame, on the other hand, are still in power. As for Mr. Museveni, after pledging to retire following his election in 2001, the Ugandan leader abolished term limits ahead of elections in 2006 and offered himself for re-election again in 2011. Many had hoped that would be his last election. But Mr. Museveni, now 69, is determined to run again. As autocrats often do, he is clothing his ambitions as a response to the ''will of the people.'' On Feb. 11, a governing party caucus of members of Parliament ''strongly'' appealed to the president to run again. This is bad news for Uganda and for East Africa. Autocratic rule has the obvious effect of weakening a country's institutions, with profound consequences for its citizens. Uganda is a poor country with a per-capita income of only $598 in 2012, according to the United Nations. A functional government in such circumstances would have sought to speed up the process of commercial production of the substantial oil reserves discovered in the country in 2006, which the World Bank estimates have the potential of accounting for 10 to 25 percent of gross domestic product. Instead, the process has been tightly controlled by the State House -- the president's official residence. Thus, while Uganda remains far away from fully developing its oil industry, the comparatively well-run West African country of Ghana, which discovered its own oil reserves a year after Uganda, has already began commercial production. Meanwhile, Mr. Museveni continues to implement ever-harsher laws aimed at stifling domestic dissent, including the much derided Public Order Management Bill, which requires that if three or more people are to gather in public to address political issues, they need permission from the police. What is to be done? Uganda is a major regional American ally with its troops having played a vital part in ousting the militant Al Shabab group from the Somali capital, Mogadishu. Public pressure on the Ugandan leader is unlikely to have the desired effect, however, and can help him play the nationalist card to serve his domestic agenda. Instead, the Obama administration should privately make it clear to Mr. Museveni that Uganda's interests would be better served if he oversees a democratic transition and that relations will not remain the same if he clings to power. A precedent exists. In Kenya, the United States ambassador to Nairobi, Johnnie Carson, played an important role in urging President Daniel arap Moi to give up power in 2002, at a time when there were attempts to amend the Constitution to allow him another run for the presidency. But rather than put pressure on Mr. Museveni to step down, the Obama administration has been focusing criticism on the anti-homosexuality law that Mr. Museveni has thrown to his supporters. This emphasis by Washington is misplaced, and will only serve the Ugandan leader's ends. Ultimately, though, only Ugandans can rid themselves of Mr. Museveni's long rule and stop their country from being left behind in the wave of progress sweeping Africa. Civil society and the opposition should threaten a boycott of the next elections unless a set of changes -- including the creation of an independent and impartial electoral commission, amendment of laws that restrict freedom of assembly, and the introduction of curbs on spending of state resources during campaigns -- are implemented. In his reformist days, President Museveni wrote a statement that he will never live down: ''The problem of Africa in general and Uganda in particular is not the people but leaders who want to overstay in power.'' Today, his refusal to step down, even though his increasingly corrupt and autocratic rule is ruining his nation's prospects, is selfish and damaging. It was a former Ugandan president, Godfrey Binaisa, who with refreshing honesty told his people that he was reluctant to give up power for purely self-interested reasons. ''Enno entebe ewooma,'' he said, quoting a Luganda proverb that means ''This chair is sweet.'' President Museveni clearly agrees. But he should accept that his determination to keep his grip on Uganda's seat of power for life is the last thing his country and Africa need in the 21st century.

The Nigerian Red Cross and some hospital officials said that many seriously injured patients were admitted and that some could die, raising the toll. About 500,000 applicants were invited to apply for 4,556 vacancies at the Nigeria Immigration Service, according to Education Rights Campaign, an activist group. Applicants said they each paid 1,000 naira (about $6) - apparently for the right to take tests Saturday at the application centers. The group, which has called for Interior Minister Abba Moro to be fired over the deaths, said it was scandalous that the government had collected about $3 million from applicants and demanded that the money be returned. Nigerians are desperate for work, with official statistics putting the unemployed at 24 percent of the 170 million population, or nearly 41 million unemployed. Unemployment among people younger than 24 is even higher - 38 percent according to official statistics and nearer 80 percent according to the World Bank. Nigeria is Africa's biggest oil producer and has one of the world's fastest-growing economies - 7 percent projected for this year - but corruption and mismanagement have failed to translate that growth into much-needed jobs. Moro held the applicants responsible, saying they ""lost their lives through their impatience."" The official News Agency of Nigeria quoted him as saying that many of the applicants ""jumped through the fences of affected centers and did not conduct themselves in an orderly manner. . . . This caused stampedes and made  the environment unsecured ."" The Education Rights Campaign, however, accused the Interior Ministry of inviting more applicants than centers could accommodate and not providing enough security. The group cited the example of Abuja National Stadium, which has a capacity for 60,000. It said that 65,000 applicants were invited and that seven people died. The other deaths occurred in Minna, Port Harcourt, Dutse and Benin City, Moro said. - Associated Press Uganda's Ticking Bomb  KAMPALA, Uganda -- In March, the United States sent 150 Air Force Special Operations forces along with military aircraft to Uganda to help capture Joseph Kony, whose Lord's Resistance Army has terrorized the country for decades. This was the first time American military planes were sent for use in the years-long search for him, though 100 American troops were deployed as advisers to central Africa in 2011 in the fight against the L.R.A. America is eager for a stable East African partner, particularly following the outbreak in December of sectarian violence in the Central African Republic. After the ''Kony 2012'' video calling for the fugitive leader's arrest went viral in the United States, many Americans were convinced that Mr. Kony was the greatest problem facing Ugandans. But he is no longer a serious threat. The country's real time bomb is a lack of educational opportunities that have over decades facilitated corruption and the recruitment of young people into terrorism and rebel movements. If the United States wants to neutralize the threat of radicalism in Uganda, it should invest in education, not a misguided manhunt. And unpalatable as it may seem to some, funds should be sent through the country's Ministry of Education and nongovernmental organizations that partner with Kampala. Uganda has one of the world's fastest-growing populations. In 2012, 78 percent of Ugandans were under 30 years old; 52 percent were 15 or under. But the country counts few quality schools. Low salaries result in high rates of teacher absenteeism: The World Bank reported in 2013 that 40 percent of public classrooms had no teacher. And dropout rates are high. Without an adequate education, many Ugandans have no path to dignified work, and youth unemployment is pervasive. In these conditions, rebel groups become appealing. And though the L.R.A. is fading, the risk of recruitment remains real. A group called the Allied Democratic Forces has attracted young people in the country's west and east; reports have surfaced of a network in the Democratic Republic of Congo that recruits unemployed Ugandan youth on the false promise of high-paying jobs. Terrorist organizations like the Shabab are also on the rise in East Africa. I myself nearly ended up in a rebel group in rural western Uganda, where I grew up. By age 10, I had lost my parents to AIDS and cancer, and four siblings to preventable diseases. Seeking a fraternity similar to the one Mr. Kony had crafted, I fell in with orphaned boys who skipped class to smoke and drink; I tattooed the initials of a rebel group on my left arm. My grandmother encouraged me to stay in school, and I graduated with top marks. But when I headed to Kampala to look for work, the only job I could find was hauling boxes for a juice factory for $1.20 a day. Worn down after months of hard labor and emotional abuse, I contemplated joining a rebel group, which seemed to offer power, structure and cash. Fortunately I was spared the decision: An American couple I met through a missionary organization helped me attend college in the United States. But emigration can't be the only path to a viable future for Uganda's young people. The Ministry of Education must rethink its recruitment policies and payment structures to reduce teacher absenteeism. Most important, the national curriculum must be modified to prepare Ugandan youth for available jobs. Most schools do not teach agricultural skills, for example, though many opportunities exist in the agriculture sector. Some worthwhile programs are already in place at the national level, like the Ugandan Ministry of Education's ''Skilling Uganda'' and the government-affiliated National Curriculum Development Center, both of which emphasize vocational training. America already provides substantial annual aid to Uganda, including hundreds of millions of dollars for AIDS prevention. But the United States Agency for International Development spent only $2.4 million in 2012 on education in Uganda. In contrast, the United States set aside over $40 million for anti-L.R.A. efforts between 2008 and 2011 alone. This military aid strengthened the regime of President Yoweri Museveni and the armed forces, which have become more involved in politics. It's true that during Mr. Museveni's 28-year reign, Uganda has witnessed an upswing in corruption, the stifling of political opposition, and, most recently, the passage of a law imposing harsh sentences, including life imprisonment, for homosexual acts. Thus, many international aid workers see the disbursement of education funds through private nongovernmental organizations as an attractive alternative to supporting the Ugandan government. But bypassing the state entirely is no solution, nor is it necessary. According to the United Nations, less than 1 percent of international donor aid (including U.S. donations) is lost to fraud, whether the money moves through the public or private sector. Systemic change in Uganda will require investment in central institutions and NGOs that work closely with Kampala, and in advocacy to keep the government accountable. If Washington wants a strong ally in Uganda, allocating millions of dollars to find Mr. Kony and fight the L.R.A. is a misuse of resources. Quality education that provides Uganda's youth with critical thinking skills and a path to stable jobs is the best way to curb corruption and neutralize the attraction of rebel and terrorist groups. Careful, monitored investment in education through official channels may be less glamorous than short-term military interventions, but it is the most effective long-term solution. James K.

Uganda."14-May-14,TUNISIA (99%); NORTHERN AFRICA (79%); EGYPT (79%); MOROCCO (79%); AFRICA (79%),"GAFSA, Tunisia -- Tunisians often say the first uprising of the Arab Spring began not in 2010 after the self-immolation of a fruit vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi, but in 2008, when protests over corrupt hiring practices at the mines of Gafsa ran on for six months. It is a measure of the lingering challenges of Tunisia's revolution that people here are still in revolt. In the towns of Moulares and Redeyef, protests have idled the phosphate mines -- a cornerstone of the economy -- for much of the last three years. Citizens regularly block roads and burn tires. Police and government officials are barely tolerated. ''We will never stop this strike until we get a job,'' said Bashir Mabrouki, 28, in a group of young people who huddled around a brazier while guarding a barricade of rocks and scrap metal that blocked shipments last month. ''We are being played by the government and their fake promises.'' The complaints are an enduring refrain even since the overthrow of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011. They point to what many here see as the unfinished business of their revolution, and a problem endemic across North Africa: the failure to meet the aspirations of a youthful population. The joblessness and aimlessness of young people remain a deep well of volatility, whether or not countries took part in the Arab Spring. Youth unemployment in neighboring Algeria is at 21 percent, according to World Bank data. In Egypt it is 25 percent, and in Morocco, 18 percent. Here in Tunisia, where more than 30 percent of young people cannot find work, the Gafsa mines are in many ways emblematic of the challenges that governments face. Jobs here have been declining since a shift to open-pit mining in the 1970s. Wary of unrest, successive governments have put the state's shoulder behind creating 15,000 jobs in the phosphate mines and attached environment, forestry and transport enterprises. While International Monetary Fund economists criticized the efforts for expanding the public sector, the state is still failing to create nearly enough opportunities for the unemployed. Some 30,000 people applied in the last round of job openings at Gafsa for just 2,700 jobs, said Kamel Ben Naceur, minister of industry, energy and mines. Each round of hiring incites a bout of new unrest from those not selected. ''This is a conservative society, and youngsters do not listen to their elders anymore, and they react because they have reached complete despair,'' said Najib Mabrouki, 51, a representative of the local labor union. The same complaints that compelled the revolt against the dictatorship -- of poverty and pollution, a lack of basic services like electricity and clean water, and corruption in parceling out coveted jobs -- continue to animate the protests against Tunisia's new technocratic government, which took over in January. In Moulares, wagons filled with mounds of gray silt stand abandoned amid weeds on train tracks, and the factory siren blares over an empty washing plant. Workers and their families have forsaken their bonuses to join the protests of the unemployed. ''There is no social justice,'' said Mohammad Nasir Saidi, who lives near the blockaded train tracks. He lost his job when the foreign mining company he worked for closed because of the unrest, yet he directs his anger at the government. ''They are stealing our natural resources, and they are not helping us. They do not care about the people.'' A small crowd of men in their 20s and 30s gathered around him. All said they were jobless. ''The revolution started here in 2008 in Moulares and Redeyef, and we are still living the revolution, protesting and chanting slogans,'' said one of the men, Hatem Behmida. Tunisia has already seen firsthand the dangers of such disaffection. During the protest here in 2008, the government under Mr. Ben Ali reacted with harsh repression, detentions and torture: Three people died in the clashes, dozens more were injured, and the protest leaders were given heavy prison sentences. Mohamed Njib Mrabet, a mining engineer, said, ''2008 was revelatory as to the social discontent of the whole population.'' Mr. Mrabet last year became chairman of the mostly state-owned Gafsa Phosphate Company, which -- together with a sister chemical company -- directly or indirectly employs about 27,000 people. ''It was very violent, the revolution,'' he recalled. ''They had practically been slaves since the French colonial period. It was revenge for everything.'' Two years later, during the Arab Spring revolt, the people here again took to the streets and chased the police and officials from their towns. But the overthrow of Mr. Ben Ali, they say, has changed little, including the strikes and blockades that threaten to cripple the phosphate mines -- and Tunisia's struggling economy along with it. Once a market leader, Tunisia has seen phosphate production slump to a third of pre-revolution volumes, and business has shifted to regional competitors. The loss of revenue has amounted to three billion Tunisian dinars, or nearly $2 billion, said Mr. Naceur, the mining minister. Even as the protests undercut the company's performance, leaders of the revolt complain that the government has been too immersed in politics and has ignored the people's needs. ''The revolution lost its way,'' said Tarek Halimi, 49, one of the leaders of the 2008 protest movement in Redeyef. ''And it is not yet on the right path because the demands were mainly social and economic.'' He criticized the government job programs as meaningless tinkering in the face of deteriorating health and living standards. ''With billions of dollars you get 10 or 20 trees and an amateur soccer team starting? It is not serious,'' he said. Families live in homes made of concrete breeze blocks beneath yellow slag heaps. A sulfurous drain from the washing plant overflows down the main street, the liquid pooling in front of the primary school gates. Residents said that they had been complaining about the overflow since 2008, but that nothing had been done about it. In the fall of 2012, frustrations turned violent, and a mob burned the phosphate company's administration building in Moulares. ''It is people who spent four years waiting, and all they have is hope,'' Hassen Mabrouki, 38, explained as he walked through the gutted building. He won a job in one of the hiring rounds, but joins the peaceful protests in solidarity. ''They got promises that have never been fulfilled, and they cannot understand what is happening,'' he said. In a cafe across the road, Anwar Leki, 24, wipes tables with pent-up anger. The son of an invalided miner, he has 12 brothers, some of them graduates, but none of them secured a job in three rounds of hiring. ''We have this phosphate powder everywhere. It comes into the house,'' he said. ''I earn six dinars ($3.75) a day. I finished high school but could not afford to go to university. You see all this and you have pain in your heart and you cannot even express yourself.''"12-Jun-14,NIGERIA (93%); EGYPT (92%); AFRICA (79%),"When Seun Kuti had his shirt off, dancing through the end of a sweaty, magnificently funky set at the Highline Ballroom on Tuesday night, the tattoo across his muscular shoulders was visible: ''Fela Lives.'' Fela Anikulapo Kuti, Seun's father, was the creator of the hardheaded, protest-minded Nigerian funk called Afrobeat, which has now spread worldwide. When Fela died in 1997, the 14-year-old Seun took over as the singer, alto saxophonist and leader of Fela's band, Egypt 80. Since then, Seun Kuti has emerged as far more than a caretaker for his father's style. In his own songs -- particularly those on his new album with Egypt 80, ''A Long Way to the Beginning'' (Knitting Factory) -- Seun Kuti makes sure that Afrobeat still bristles. Where Fela's music often moved at smoldering medium tempos, Seun's newer songs are faster, more insistent. The arrangements have added new layers of dissonance to give the songs more bite. And the underlying call and response of Afrobeat, with terse motifs traded among the band's percussion, horns, guitars and singers, has turned denser and less symmetrical; now, little overlapping outbursts cascade across the band, like sporadic flash fires. Songs may have just two chords, but as they stretch out, they reveal dozens of compositional ideas. Between the two generations of Kutis, the targets of the lyrics have changed very little. Like his father, Seun Kuti lashes out at corruption, economic inequality, indifferent governments and predatory Western financial interests, as he did in the hurtling, furious ''I.M.F.'' He introduced ''African Airways'' as ''a parody about the African economic system,'' with a Western pilot, an African co-pilot, World Bank radar and Chinese engines; eight minutes into its brisk, chattering modal groove, the percussion erupted for ''heavy turbulence!'' Partway through the set, Mr. Kuti launched into a lecture that delved into economic strife, food supplies and -- moving forward from his father's male chauvinism -- respect for women's intellectual power. That led into a song, in Fela's steadfast, slow-rolling style, that paid tribute to the ''Black Woman'': ''She struggle to go to school/she struggle to vote.'' Robert Glasper, the genre-stretching jazz keyboardist, produced ''A Long Way to the Beginning'' with Mr. Kuti, and he sat in on ''Higher Consciousness,'' a song about unrest and violence in Nigeria. Mr. Glasper meshed its groove with Minimalist repetition of percussive chords and arpeggios and a suggestion of ''A Love Supreme'' -- a more benign Western intervention. Throughout the set, the music changed constantly as the propulsion surged; the power of the rhythms redoubled the urgency of the messages, while the two backup singers rarely stopped shimmying. Mr. Kuti's Afrobeat makes its politics physical, its anger into momentum."22-Oct-14,LIBERIA (95%),"In yet another step in Tunisia's transition, Tunisians will vote for a new parliament Oct. 26. Polls suggest the economy remains Tunisians' highest priority. Despite economic turmoil since the 2011 revolution, expectations are high for a quick turnaround once the new government is in place. While this optimism is admirable, economic growth will require a much deeper political resolve than has been apparent. Recent research published by the World Bank, much of which would have been impossible to conduct prior to 2011, highlights that Tunisia's economic problems are not the result of the insecurity and lower investor confidence after the revolution. Rather, they are the direct outcome of poorly designed economic policies, which were in place under ousted president Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali and still remain. The resulting lack of jobs and unequal access to economic opportunity were at the heart of the 2011 revolution. The World Bank report argues that the continuation of the economic status quo poses a threat to Tunisia's transition. In March, the World Bank published a study documenting the extent to which Ben Ali's clan was able to manipulate Tunisia's investment policies to its own benefit. The analysis found that companies that were confiscated and given to his extended family accounted for just 1 percent of jobs but were able to reap a formidable 21 percent of the country's private-sector profits. For more than two decades, Ben Ali was able to preserve this economic system through coercion, repression and patronage. Close connections might be rewarded with a top spot at a state-owned company, a hotel license or access to a lucrative closed sector. Lower-level associates might get access to a government job or face fewer restrictions obtaining land or getting a business license. Loyalty rather than merit was rewarded. The World Bank's latest research highlights that, beyond the extractive nature of the former ruling family, Tunisia relies to a large extent on these same restrictions and appears to be trapped in an economic model that was designed in the 1970s. Tunisia's investment regime, for example, limits potential new investment to less than 50 percent of the Tunisian economy. Whether through public or private monopolies or oligopolies, dozens of sectors are either explicitly or de facto closed to any meaningful competition. The laundry list includes telecoms, road and air transport, tobacco, fisheries, tourism, advertising, health, education, vocational and professional training, real estate, agricultural extension services, retail and distribution and telecommunication services. And the list goes on. Furthermore, many of these restrictions on competition rely on a complex bureaucracy in which the room for discretion in administering the web of regulations further encourages corruption. The study documents, for example, how the prevalence of corruption ""to speed things up"" in Tunisia is among the highest in the world. More than a quarter of all firms declared they have to provide an informal payment to accelerate some form of interaction with the administration. The report estimates that close to 13 percent of firm annual sales are spent to deal with these regulations. This, in turn, fosters corruption, costing firms an additional 2 to 5 percent of their revenue every year - revenue that cannot be reinvested into greater productivity or more employment. This economic environment has had three complementary results. At the firm level, there is very little entry of new businesses and very few businesses grow or even exit the market. So, rather than grow or die, firms simply stagnate. At the aggregate level, the economy has remained stuck in low productivity sectors, and has experienced surprisingly little reallocation of factors of production toward more productive, and remunerative, activities. Thirdly, more than half of Tunisia's exports consist of low value added products for France and Italy, which are largely just assembled in Tunisia from imported intermediate components. The result is that Tunisia is underperforming its competitors in the global economy. The report estimates that this lack of competition costs the country nearly 5 percent of GDP each year - approximately the same amount spent on public investment. Economists almost euphemistically call these problems structural, but that misses the broader point. The impact is more nefarious than underperformance of the domestic economy. In Tunisia, a patronage-based economy succeeds not only in enriching a privileged few, it entrenches severely exclusionary, non-competitive and distortional elements into the heart of the Tunisian economy. These issues are not unique to Tunisia, and in some respects are a feature of most dictatorships. But as public opinion polling has confirmed, they are at the heart of why so many citizens across the Arab world have demanded change over the past several years - a change from a system in which whom you know matters more than what you know. The good news is that Tunisia has many institutional elements that will help any government that takes on these challenges, in particular the country's much lauded new constitution, which enshrines the critical principles of neutrality and transparency into law. Whether this will be enough to unseat the vested interests that are content with the status quo will be a large determinant of Tunisia's ongoing transition.

Liberia's Crisis Puts President in Harsh Light  MONROVIA, Liberia -- The president waited until her family members were seated around the dining table before announcing, with no fanfare, the latest defection from her cabinet. ''I lost my justice minister today,'' she said, picking up a spoon before heading out to visit Ebola treatment units. As the table erupted with questions, the president, having said all that she intended to, finished up her lunch of Libby's tinned corned beef and rice -- the Liberian equivalent of ramen noodles -- and rose. ''We're late,'' she announced, not mentioning that everyone had been waiting for her for four hours. ''Let's go, let's go.'' For the last eight years, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, 76, has walked a precarious political tightrope. As Liberia's first elected leader after a devastating civil war, she has juggled enemies and allies while pushing this country on its first sustained course of economic growth in decades. Now, Ebola has brought many of those gains to a screeching halt. The foreign investors so lovingly wooed by Ms. Johnson Sirleaf, a former World Bank bureaucrat, have fled. Today, ordinary Liberians on the street fling around the obscure phrase ''force majeure'' to describe why businesses have closed, employers have left and road construction has ended. Public schools, in a country where less than 50 percent of primary-school-age children were enrolled, have been shut for months. The World Bank warns that Ebola could slash Liberia's fragile economy by nearly 12 percent. All but two foreign airlines, which Ms. Johnson Sirleaf had proudly welcomed back to the country after two decades of isolation, stopped flying here. ''Right now, all the international attention is on Ebola,'' she said of critics, including at the United Nations, who say she has been more worried about the economy than a health catastrophe. ''If we don't focus on our economy, we will not be able to sustain it when they are gone.'' Ms. Johnson Sirleaf is the first woman elected president of an African country, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and arguably the most recognized leader on the continent. Rising from a junior bureaucrat, she became one of the few top Liberian officials not executed by firing squad during the 1980 military coup. From a jailed dissident in the 1980s, she became one of Newsweek's 10 top leaders in the world. But Ebola is threatening to derail that legacy. The epidemic has exposed crippling weaknesses in the public health system, decrepit infrastructure that has still not been dealt with more than a decade after the war, and endemic corruption that, despite Ms. Johnson Sirleaf's protestations of ''zero tolerance,'' continue to characterize the interactions between Liberians and their government. ''The international community has arrived and is now seeing our backyard for the first time,'' said Francis Dunbar, a former deputy finance minister who now supports Benoni Urey, a Johnson Sirleaf rival who was once a close adviser of Charles Taylor, the former president convicted of crimes against humanity. ''The front yard is clean but the backyard is dirty.'' Karin Landgren, the United Nations secretary general's special representative here, echoed a similar theme. ''Ebola has shown a very harsh light on the many things that had not been done adequately. Very tangible things, like the health care system.'' With the global spotlight on Liberia, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf's many domestic critics have found an international audience. Last month, the asthmatic daughter of Representative Edward Forh, a legislator, died after nurses refused to admit her until Ebola tests were run. Distraught, Mr. Forh took to the airwaves to denounce Ms. Johnson Sirleaf's government, saying that the president was ''surrounded by two groups of people: one group completely ignorant and the other group completely deceitful.'' But just last year, Mr. Forh's colleagues in the Liberian Legislature voted to arrest one of the president's allies for releasing a recording in which Mr. Forh suggested that public funds should be given to him in a kickback scheme. ''You eat some, I eat some,'' Mr. Forh was recorded saying, meaning kickbacks and bribes. The epidemic has inflamed such longstanding fights. Ms. Johnson Sirleaf says the criticism does not take into account how hard Liberia's culture of corruption is to overcome, and how widespread the postwar problems she inherited were. When she took office in 2006, unemployment was so high no one bothered to calculate it. There was no running water and no electricity, as gunmen had bombed the country's hydro plant. Downtown Monrovia at night looked medieval: candles in shopfronts cast their dim glow on the ribbons of dirty water running down the gutters. Children routinely died of curable diseases like tuberculosis, malaria and measles. Even among the unafflicted, few went to schools, and those who did had no textbooks. Liberia was $4.7 billion in debt, no longer considered creditworthy. By just about every economic indicator, the country has come a long way since. Growth shot up to 8.9 percent in 2013, from 5.3 percent in 2006. Ms. Johnson Sirleaf prodded international lenders to forgive Liberia's debt. Monrovia now has electricity, although many cannot afford it, while running water has been making a slow return around the country. ''Look, I know that I'm a soft target for criticism right now,'' the president said. Her S.U.V. hit a pothole so deep she had to reach out to grab the armrest. Ms. Johnson Sirleaf glanced out the window, at an enormous pile of trash in front of a long-shuttered paint factory. Muttering ''trash like you wouldn't believe,'' she instructed her security detail to call the property's owner to clean up. ''People have forgotten the environment in which we used to live, because things now have become so free,'' she said. ''What moves a lot of the perceptions out there is our free talk on the radio, and in the press.'' In the past, critics of the government were often jailed or even executed. Ms. Johnson Sirleaf was jailed after calling members of the military government of President Samuel K. Doe ''idiots.'' Today, the radio in Liberia buzzes with critics denouncing Ms. Johnson Sirleaf for nepotism (she appointed her son to run the national oil company), corruption (she has dismissed a string of officials in her government for corruption but has not prosecuted them) and, most recently, for supposedly manufacturing the Ebola epidemic as a ruse to get foreign aid money. Many Liberians, including some critics of Ms. Johnson Sirleaf, say that Liberia has no political leader more capable of steering the country out of its latest crisis, especially given her international reputation. When she sat down on the night of Sept. 9 and wrote a letter to President Obama pleading for help, the response came days later and dwarfed anything that neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea have been able to muster: 4,000 American troops, to build 18 Ebola treatment units in Liberia. Now, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf is trying to leverage Ebola help for broader economic projects -- like fixing the runway at the airport. ''The support that's coming must not all go into Ebola,'' Ms. Johnson Sirleaf said. On a muddy highway, her motorcade came to a small market along the road, with women selling fruits and vegetables. ''Aye, man, I need to buy those women them bananas,'' Ms. Johnson Sirleaf said. ''Buy those women's red potatoes and bananas. And some of those guavas them.'' The motorcade stopped, and from one of the cars, an aide jumped out with a wad of cash and cleaned out the market. The weeks since Ebola hit have been dotted by crisis after crisis, some big, many minuscule. Two days before, Justice Minister Christiana Tah had sat unspeaking at a meeting with international donors. Everyone argued around a massive table at the foreign ministry, with Ms. Johnson Sirleaf at the head, looking like a stern teacher trying to rein in a bunch of unruly children. Her health minister harrumphed about international ''free agents'' doing as they pleased without so much as a by-your-leave from the Liberian government. The American ambassador shot back that there were plenty of mechanisms to keep aid groups in their proper place. And the minister of defense, Brownie Samukai, was heckled for 15 minutes by a Liberian women's empowerment leader to pass one of the platters of Spam and cheese offered as snacks. He ignored her, trying to pay attention to the meeting, but his heckler raised her voice louder. ''I say, Brownie, you will not pass people de food?'' the advocate demanded. ''This how you treat women?'' Finally, an exasperated Ms. Johnson Sirleaf called a timeout. ''Very well,'' she said. ''Y'all can take a break to have some chips.'' On the drive to visit Ebola treatment units, she recalled that moment with a shake of her head. ''We're accustomed to the president being at the pivot of everything, making every decision, because we've been used to an imperial presidency,'' she said. ''And even if I'm not so inclined, they almost make you make every decision.'' Just hours before, the justice minister, Ms. Tah, used her resignation news conference to accuse Ms. Johnson Sirleaf of trying to block a corruption investigation into Liberia's National Security Agency, which is headed by another of the president's sons. Ms. Johnson Sirleaf denied the charge; it was the same son, Fumbah Sirleaf, who helped American agents pull off West Africa's largest drug bust in 2010. Ms. Tah's resignation came on the heels of Ms. Johnson Sirleaf's firing of officials who had abandoned the country during the Ebola outbreak. And now Mr. Forh was on the radio again, saying her government should take responsibility for his daughter's death. Her S.U.V. had driven only 44 miles from Monrovia, but the potholes and rain -- the Chinese contractors hired to pave the road left in August along with others fleeing Ebola -- meant the drive had taken an hour and a half. The trip would be an additional 143 miles, on an even worse road. But Ms. Johnson Sirleaf was determined to go and return by the next night -- she had more Ebola-related meetings to manage. ''My adrenaline flows better in a crisis,'' Ms. Johnson Sirleaf said as a line of buses -- each stenciled with slogans like ''God's Appointed Time'' and ''God is in Control'' -- pulled over to let her motorcade pass. She grinned. ''This will end up as one of the biggest challenges I've had in a life of many challenges,'' she said. ''And like all the other challenges, we will overcome this.''"2-Apr-15,NIGERIA (97%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%); CHAD (79%),"KANO, Nigeria --  Nigeria's president-elect, Muhammadu Buhari, did not smile while making his acceptance speech on Wednesday -- understandably, as terrorism and corruption were his main talking points. A day after piling up substantial vote totals against the incumbent president, Mr. Buhari, a former general who once rose to power in a military coup, further consolidated something extraordinary for Nigeria: the peaceful passing of power from one political party to another through the ballot box. The country is now a democratic nation like others, Mr. Buhari suggested Wednesday, both in his words and in the fact that the democratic process had worked well enough that he could give the speech at all. But in his remarks in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, Mr. Buhari also bluntly enumerated two scourges in this giant democracy: the ruthless onslaught of the Boko Haram militant group and the ''evil of corruption,'' as he put it. In pairing them so prominently, he appeared to be setting his agenda for the coming months. And in lieu of a detailed policy platform from Mr. Buhari, who was short on specifics during his campaign, his vow to defeat Boko Haram amounts to a national security strategy, while fighting corruption has become an economic one. On Wednesday, he focused more on the challenges posed by corruption than on the dangers of Boko Haram, perhaps indicating a veteran soldier's disdain for the group as a true military threat. Though Boko Haram has killed thousands of civilians and stormed across big stretches of territory, Mr. Buhari was bluntly dismissive of the insurgents in a January interview on the campaign trail, characterizing their fighting abilities in disparaging terms. ''Boko Haram will soon know the strength of our collective will,'' he said Wednesday. ''We shall spare no effort until we defeat terrorism.'' As a practical matter, Boko Haram, despite having pledged allegiance to the Islamic State terrorist group, is now less of a menace on the ground in Nigeria than it was in January. A coalition of foreign and domestic troops has substantially reduced Boko Haram's footprint in the northeastern territory it had been holding for much of the past few years. Troops from Chad have taken the handful of border towns once held by the militants, and the Nigerians, backed by South African mercenaries, have taken others. It is impossible to verify the Nigerian military's claim that nearly all the previously Islamist-occupied towns in the northeast -- ''local government areas,'' as they are called in Nigeria -- have now been reclaimed from Boko Haram. But many have been, and the latest, Gwoza, had been a Boko Haram stronghold for months. More challenging for Mr. Buhari will be the rot in the army that led to Boko Haram's ascendance in the first place: corruption at high levels, poor morale, and troops underequipped because much of the $6 billion military budget has apparently been diverted. ''What they have is such an institutional problem, it's going to take a long time to fix it,'' said a diplomat in Abuja, who was not authorized to speak publicly. The hiring of mercenaries to defeat Boko Haram is a ''short- to mid-term solution until they can address the other thing,'' the diplomat said. In interviews, Mr. Buhari has spoken of his anger at seeing foreign troops play a leading role in solving Nigeria's Boko Haram problem. But he may not have much choice for now. Most difficult for him will be how to handle the command deficiencies that put frightened, lightly armed soldiers in the field against Boko Haram, leading to many losses and retreats in Nigeria's nearly six-year battle with the militants. Human rights abuses against civilians by the Nigerian military have also been disturbingly common, with soldiers killing and detaining residents en masse. ''What has been consistently lacking is the required leadership in our battle against insurgency,'' Mr. Buhari said in a speech at the London think tank Chatham House in late February. Here, he will tread gingerly, Mr. Buhari has suggested, seeking to determine responsibilities before proceeding to, say, firing the top chiefs whom many blame for Nigeria's military failures. Boko Haram led Mr. Buhari on Wednesday to segue immediately into Nigeria's corruption problem, which ''attacks our national character'' and ''distorts the economy,'' he said. He made it clear that, falling oil prices aside, he sees this as the country's top economic problem, telling the audience at Abuja's International Conference Center that ''such an illegal yet powerful force soon comes to undermine democracy.'' He promised to ''end this threat to our economic development and democratic survival.'' At Chatham House, Mr. Buhari suggested that what he called a ''war waged on corruption'' would be the first step in tackling the country's pressing economic problems. The price of oil, on which the government depends for over 70 percent of its revenue, has tumbled. Nigeria's currency has fallen some 20 percent against the dollar over six months. Foreign currency reserves are dwindling, and an oil-revenue rainy day fund has been ransacked. ''In the face of dwindling revenues, a good place to start the repositioning of Nigeria's economy is to swiftly tackle two ills that have ballooned under the present administration: waste and corruption,'' Mr. Buhari said at Chatham House. Several Nigerian economists suggested that Mr. Buhari's strategy was plausible as a first step. ''The first thing to do is to recognize that there is so much waste in government,'' said a leading Lagos economist, Pat Utomi. ''If you cut the graft, you can do things,'' he said. ''We have a new presidential jet in this budget. Most airlines in Nigeria don't have as many jets as the presidential fleet.'' Another economist also suggested that Mr. Buhari's anticorruption stance was critical in a country with, as a recent World Bank paper put it, a ''deeply embedded culture of corruption.'' With the new president's emphasis on ''accountability, integrity and transparency,'' one economist, Bismarck Rewane, said the ''missing piece in the Nigerian economy'' would be filled in. Of course, other Nigerian politicians have promised to end corruption, only to fail or even steal with abandon afterward. But there is some reason to think Mr. Buhari may hew more closely to his promises. As military ruler in 1984 and 1985, he did not enrich himself. And he ruthlessly pursued those whom he accused of corruption. ''Corruption will not be tolerated by this administration, and it shall no longer be allowed to stand as if it is a respected monument in this nation,'' he said Wednesday.

Hundreds of politicians and businessmen were convicted by military courts, and minor offenses -- like cheating on exams -- were enough to send Nigerians to jail. Mr. Buhari was himself overthrown 20 months later, yet now, at age 72, he has returned to rule Nigeria -- and, he vows, to continue the war on corruption. The difference is that he has returned through a democratic election. It's a huge difference. The general election in Nigeria on March 28 was the most competitive ever held in Africa's most populous country, and if the defeated president, Goodluck Jonathan, peacefully hands power to Mr. Buhari on May 29, it will be the first handover between civilians of different political parties since independence. Given Mr. Jonathan's gracious concession after his crushing defeat, there is no reason to doubt that this will happen, and every reason to hope that other African states follow the example of the ''giant of Africa.'' Mr. Buhari's victory was in part due to selective public memory of his earlier rule. To a majority of Nigerian voters, the trim and austere former general increasingly appeared to be the one leader who could stanch the massive loss of wealth to what the World Bank called a ''deeply embedded culture of corruption,'' and who could rebuild the army into a force capable of taking on the militant Islamist group Boko Haram, which has spread terror and death for almost six years now through northeastern Nigeria. The outgoing government had claimed some success against Boko Haram, but that was achieved only by hiring South African mercenaries. Mr. Buhari's task will not be easy. The price of oil, the resource from which the government draws the bulk of its funding, has fallen sharply, taking Nigeria's currency and foreign currency reserves with it, and history shows that a culture of corruption is not easily uprooted. But the president-elect has made clear that he is aware of the challenges before him. More important, the Nigerian electorate, which gave him and his All Progressives Congress party 55 percent of its vote across geographic, religious and tribal lines, has made clear that it is thoroughly sick of corruption and Boko Haram. Mr. Buhari promises, this time, to abide by the law. Should he be tempted to slide back into his old authoritarian ways, there is another election just four years down the road.

NAIROBI, Kenya -- Is Kenya losing its luster as the star of a rising Africa? The short answer is, no. But from afar it certainly looks that way. Consider a modest sampling of recent events: A member of Parliament is assassinated in the heart of downtown Nairobi. A few weeks later, a prominent businessman is shot 15 times in a gangland execution. Students at an aviation school here stage a raucous rally after media reports reveal that many won their certificates by allegedly bribing administrators. Think about that: Aspiring aviation technicians who will one day be working on complicated machines that fly through the air carrying large numbers of people are graduating in some cases without attending classes. Police officers fire tear gas at elementary and middle school students and teachers protesting wealthy land-grabbers conspiring to steal the kids' playing fields. Images of children running from the riot police amid clouds of tear gas flash around the world. In early April, the country was hit with its latest terrorist drama: the killing of 148 people at Garissa University near the Somali border by militant Islamists. Why did it take Kenya's elite special police force seven hours to get to the scene, Kenyans asked. They got a sickening answer. A senior official ordered the unit's plane to ferry his daughter-in-law and two children back to Nairobi from the coastal resort town of Mombasa, even as the crisis unfolded. More recently, the international Committee to Protect Journalists reported on two Kenyan journalists beaten by paramilitary police officers using clubs and iron bars. According to the CPJ, this was but the latest in a series of attacks on journalists reporting allegations of police corruption. At times, Kenya seems its own worst enemy. When it comes to issues that the rest of the world pays most attention to, the country has an unerring knack for shooting itself in the foot. In 2013, the government proposed new security legislation imposing onerous penalties on news organizations deemed by a government-controlled panel to be unreliable in their reporting. Another law proposed to ban NGOs from receiving more than 15 percent of their funding from foreign sources; in December, the government deregistered more than 500, allegedly for failing to file financial returns. International news agencies and global human rights organizations had a field day. Democracy under threat! they trumpeted. Crackdown on the media! This year brought a similar flap. In an effort to accelerate Kenya's transition to digital broadcasting, the government interfered with the operations of three television networks, allegedly for moving too slowly. After police officials forcibly closed their transmission station, the networks shut down their own digital signals in protest and plunged the country into a three-week news and entertainment blackout. Adding insult to injury, the regulators had awarded licenses to a pair of competitors, one owned by the government and the other a Chinese company, along with rights to rebroadcast local and international content regardless of copyright. Kenya's political opposition shifted into high gear. Rival political leaders accused the government of seeking to crush free speech and tame the country's robustly independent media. Absurdly, one went so far as to charge President Uhuru Kenyatta with leading the nation into ''dictatorship.'' Not surprisingly, the world's media lasered in on the controversy. On these global litmus tests for democracy and civil society, Kenya was seen to be failing. The real story, of course, is more complicated. For all the sturm und drang, the controversies that drew so much critical international scrutiny have largely fallen away. The proposed laws restricting the media are under review by the Supreme Court and likely to be quietly renegotiated. The most onerous NGO restrictions were dropped when the bill became law, and few have had to curtail their activities. In the fight over digital migration, a deal has been made. The country's three major networks are back on the air, licenses restored. And to be fair, the government was not wholly in the wrong. For years, Kenya's major broadcasters had been resisting a move that other nations made long ago, missing deadline after deadline. The licenses granted to those companies had earlier been offered to the major media houses and turned down. To those in the know, their very successful effort to cast themselves as victims of rapacious regulators smacked of self-serving spin. Meanwhile, there has been bona fide good news. Economic growth for 2015 has been projected at 6.9 percent by the International Monetary Fund and 6 percent by the World Bank, higher than past forecasts. Foreign investment continues to pour into the country. Apart from insecurity, according to the I.M.F. and World Bank, the chief impediment to a brighter future is corruption, poor governance and debt. Coincidentally or not, the Kenyan government appears to be listening. In recent months, it has launched a sweeping anticorruption drive. A dozen former and current cabinet ministers and regional governors are under investigation for graft; formal indictments and more prosecutions are said to be on the way. Kenya's media outlets are launching investigations of their own and devoting major coverage to the crackdown -- oddly, however, without giving much credit to the government for initiating the campaign. Enter the spin-meisters. Mindful of the importance of global perceptions, Kenya's government is undertaking a public relations blitz to refurbish its image. In February, it hired the Podesta Group, whose chairman, Tony Podesta, is a lobbyist with extensive ties with Democratic leaders. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain has been brought in to attract foreign backing for a series of high-profile infrastructure and technology projects. A prominent global public relations firm most recently joined the effort to resuscitate Kenya's tourist industry. Whether these big names will do more than collect big fees is an open question. More to the point is whether Mr. Kenyatta can deliver on his anticorruption drive and stop his ministers from egregiously thieving from the public till. When it comes to Kenya's image in the world, he must find a way to keep them from shooting themselves in the foot, particularly on issues that attract so much international attention. If he succeeds, Kenya will prosper, regardless of its terrorists. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

From Ethiopia's crackdown on journalists and opposition viewpoints to Kenya's attempt to restrain media freedoms, governments have been using the pretext of counterterrorism to suppress criticism. Even in countries less affected by terrorism, governments are using draconian laws to restrict independent reporting on official activities. Take Tanzania, for example. Ranked as ""partly free"" by Freedom House in its annual report on press freedom, the country is part of the U.S.-led Open Government Partnership , a coalition of 65 governments and numerous civil society organizations committed to transparency. But the government of President Jakaya Kikwete is on the verge of adopting some of the region's most draconian information laws, which were passed quickly through parliament in March and now await Mr. Kikwete's signature. One, a cybercrime bill, would criminalize the publication of information that the government deems to be ""misleading, deceptive or false,"" with a penalty of up to six months in prison.  Another would  criminalize the ""distortion of facts"" by the publication of statistics not authorized by the National Bureau of Statistics; offenders could be sentenced to at least a year in prison. If signed by Mr. Kikwete, these strictures would stifle informed policy debates ahead of the country's elections in October. This is not the first time that Tanzania has used legal means to squelch the press. Earlier this year, the East African newspaper was banned in Tanzania after 20 years of operation after it published a cartoon lampooning Mr. Kikwete. The government claimed that the paper violated a 1976 newspaper registration law, which has been used to shutter media houses with which the government disagrees. At least 17 laws are on the books that hamper the media's ability to report freely in Tanzania. Tanzania has long been held up in the region as a U.S. partner in open governance, rule of law and transparency. In 2008, the U.S.  Millennium Challenge Corporation awarded the country the largest grant in the program's history,  nearly $700 million. The World Bank is proposing to loan Tanzania $100 million for an open government program. What's more, Tanzania is set to host the second Africa regional meeting of the Open Government Partnership from May 19 to May 21, under the theme ""Enhancing Accountability through Open Governance."" But a country  that is on the verge of criminalizing data dissemination and is shutting down newspapers to stifle criticism can hardly be called a leader in open governance. The Millennium Challenge Corporation already has linked a renewal of its compact with Tanzania to steps by the government to combat corruption. It should go further and make future aid conditional on the dropping of laws stifling free expression. The World Bank should do so as well. Secretary of State John F. Kerry recently called Tanzania a ""model in the region of good governance, democratic ideals and individual freedoms"" - praise that's impossible to square with the information crackdown. The Obama administration does democracy in Tanzania - or in Africa - no favor by continuing to ignore the country's backslide on freedoms. The U.S. needs to stop ignoring Tanzania's media crackdowns; The government of Tanzania is on the verge of passing draconian information laws, while being praised by the U.S. as a leader on open governance and transparency.  Tanzania, a country that has long been upheld by Washington as an example of transparency and governance in Africa, is on the verge of enacting some of the most draconian laws on data sharing in the region. And it's being done largely in secret. The U.S. government, as well as development agencies such as the World Bank, do Tanzanians a disservice by failing to condemn laws that could severely harm media freedom. In March, Tanzania's parliament rushed through two bills that_contain language that journalists and activists decry as a threat to free expression and to journalism. The first bill, the Cybercrime Act, which the government has said is necessary to cut down on cybersecurity threats to the country, was_passed in the middle of the night and contains harsh punitive measures such as fines and at least six months of jail time for sending unsolicited messages via computer. In other words, in Tanzania one could be sent to prison for sending spam to a friend. The newly passed Statistics Act is also disturbing. Under certain clauses in the bill, ""any communication media, (magazines, newspapers, websites, or radio, for example) which publishes false or misleading statistical information"" could be punished with a fine of ""not less than 10 million shillings [about $5000] or to imprisonment of not less than twelve months, or both."" Furthermore, any person who_dares publish statistics that may lead to what the government deems as a ""distortion of facts"" and_without the authorization of the National Statistics Bureau can be punished with at least a_year in prison. That's not quite the behavior you'd want from a country Secretary of State John Kerry recently claimed is a ""model in the region for good governance, democratic ideals, and individual freedoms."" The statistics bill threatens to criminalize those journalists and whistleblowers reporting on government corruption, for example. It could punish nongovernmental agencies that conduct their own statistical research or challenge official government statistics. ""The first victims of this is the media,"" said Maria Sarungi Tsehai, a media activist and commentator in Tanzania. ""They are the ones publishing statistics to the much broader public. These two bills are a definite sign of a very worrying trend. What has become evident is that there has been an indefinite shutdown of newspapers, using archaic laws."" Mike Mckee, co-founder of Jamii_ Forums, one of Tanzania's largest online platforms, said in an interview, ""You can imagine traditional media wouldn't publish on issues like water, or education, because they will be afraid to be penalized. They would be afraid to be taken down."" President Jakaya Kikwete is expected to sign the bills into law. But few know what the final versions of the bills even look like, which is troubling. And there may be deeper reasons as to why the government has rushed these pieces of legislation outside of the eye of the public. The ruling party of Kikwete, the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), is facing national elections this year. And the CCM, which has been in power for 50 years, is facing significant challenges from the opposition. Now more than ever, the use of mobile phones and social media in Tanzania makes information sharing much easier. The hurried passing of these bills serves to stifle criticism and dissent ahead of October's national polls and speaks of a government uncomfortable with the new realities of online media and data flows. What better way to control the narrative about the country's development than by controlling statistics and information sharing? The international donor community has a hand in this mess, too. According to publicly available documents, the World Bank is in the stages of implementing a $100 million loan to Tanzania to support Open Government and Public Financial Management (OGPFM) in the country. The OGPFM project is closely linked to a parallel program_in which the bank has been working with Tanzania's Statistics Bureau to build the country's statistics capacity. The project costs_$30 million to implement. (Disclosure: I temporarily consulted for the World Bank two years ago.) And what is one of the indicators of the World Bank statistics project? An operational statistics act, with a completion target date of June 30. ""We are very aware of the statistics bill, and indeed we do share concerns about some clauses of the bill. We have made these concerns clear to the government,"" said Philippe Dongier, the World Bank's country director for Tanzania. Dongier said he had not seen the latest version of the bill that is awaiting Kilwete's signature. He also did not comment specifically on if he knew whether the government would address the parts of the bill that threaten to crack down on the media for publishing independent statistics. Ah, the familiar and convenient expression of ""concern"" from donors and country partners when a recipient government is behaving badly. But what Tanzanians need from the U.S. government, from the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corp. (which pumped nearly $700 million into Tanzania in 2008, the largest grant in the program's history) and from the World Bank is much more than concern behind closed-door lunch meetings. What the international donor community and partner governments owe Tanzanians (as well as the citizens of other donor-dependent countries) are strong public statements denouncing the increasing crackdowns on freedoms_and the conditioning of further aid to demonstrable improvements in the country's treatment of journalists and opposition viewpoints. Donor agencies need to ensure what they deem as merely a project deliverable to tick off the box, (such as the World Bank's statistics act) doesn't actually harm the people they are supposed to be serving. Ironically, next week, Tanzania, as part of President Obama's Open Government Partnership Initiative, is hosting the Africa regional meeting on open governance. Kikwete must take this opportunity to publicly drop the portions of these laws that stand to punish journalists and researchers for doing their jobs. And the World Bank, the United States and other donor entities need to stop ignoring Tanzania's increasing repression and speak out - strongly. Map: These countries have the world's deadliest roads; India's alarming number of traffic deaths and road violations gripped the nation earlier this month.  Traffic fatalities on India's roads caught the nation's attention earlier this month when Bollywood star Salman Khan was convicted of killing a homeless man while driving drunk in 2002. Khan's release on bail sparked angry reactions throughout the country, highlighting the large number of people who die in car accidents in India each year. [Read:_India's roads are among the deadliest in the world. Can new laws tame drivers?] Drunk driving in India is a major cause of traffic accidents. As Quartz India noted in a piece titled ""On India's deadly roads, there are over 20,000 Salman Khans every year,"" thousands of people die and even more injured annually. But the problem extends beyond driving under the influence -- India only accounts for 1 percent of all motor vehicles but 15 percent of the accidents, according to the World Bank. So how does India rank globally? Here are the top 10 countries by fatalities each year, according to the World Health Organization: If you look at the data of traffic fatalities by 100,000 people each year, India's rate drops sufficiently. The top countries here are Eritrea, Dominican Republic, Libya, Thailand and Venzuela, according to the World Health Organization. The numbers are still alarming. This data from Bloomberg Philanthropies from 2013 shows the 10 countries that account for 600,000 fatalities annually: As my colleague Rama Lakshmi writes, India has been trying to tackle the causes of road fatalities. The nation's supreme court calls India's roads ""giant killers."" Experts say that many of the accused go free because of weak and outdated motor vehicle regulations, routine corruption, laggingtardy investigations and painfully slow court trials. A factor to these crashes are the urban speed laws, which WHO deemed ""not comprehensive."" Read the full story on India's road conditions here. Human Rights Watch Accuses World Bank of Inaction When Protesters Face Reprisals  WASHINGTON --  A major human rights organization on Monday accused the World Bank of doing little or nothing when critics of its projects are harassed and intimidated by governments that benefit from its loans. The organization, Human Rights Watch, released an extensive report documenting multiple cases in India, Cambodia, Uganda, Uzbekistan and elsewhere where critics of projects funded by the World Bank were arrested or harassed by officials because the critics tried to slow, change or stop the projects. ''The bank should put in place special measures to deal with reprisals against critics, but it hasn't,'' said Jessica Evans, a senior advocate and researcher at Human Rights Watch and co-author of the report. ''The World Bank simply isn't comfortable talking about human rights issues.'' In one case in northern India highlighted by the rights group, a 30-year-old critic of a hydroelectric power project funded by the World Bank said employees of the company in charge of constructing the dam publicly ridiculed protesters as prostitutes, insulted their caste and warned of ''severe'' consequences if protests continued. Some 300 million people have no electricity in India, and hundreds of millions more get only a few hours of power each day. Even so, India already has some of the worst air pollution in the world, with 13 of the 25 most polluted cities on the planet, according to the World Health Organization, and The Lancet reporting that 1.5 million deaths each year result from unhealthy air. So hydroelectric power is widely seen even by many environmentalists as vital to improving the lives of hundreds of millions of people in India while not worsening an already dire pollution situation. Ms. Evans dismissed concerns that such vital development projects might not be constructed at all if the World Bank began to intervene in politically sensitive issues, like the right to protest publicly against government efforts. Even in democracies like India, protests are often dealt with harshly. The report quoted President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda as saying: ''Those who delay industrial projects are enemies, and I don't want them. I am going to open war on them.'' In fact, support for crucial development projects in poor nations has been canceled because of concerns raised by the World Bank. One such project is the Padma Multipurpose Bridge project in Bangladesh, which could transform the lives of hundreds of thousands of poor farmers; the World Bank canceled its support in 2012 because of concerns about corruption, delaying construction by years. In 2014, the bank postponed a $90 million loan to Uganda's health system over a law that toughened punishment of gays. ''When allegations of reprisal are brought to our attention, we work, within the scope of our mandate, with appropriate parties to try to address them,'' said David Theis, a World Bank spokesman. He said the bank had taken action in cases where reprisals against critics had been documented, ''and we will continue to do so.'' But Ms. Evans said the World Bank needed to work harder to persuade countries to protect protesters against arrest and other reprisals. ''The World Bank generally has high-level access to the governments it supports and could exert pressure to push them to tolerate divergent views and accept criticism about development projects as valuable rather than cracking down on dissident voices,'' Human Rights Watch said in a statement.

A new research paper by World Bank economists released Thursday shows that companies owned by relatives and close allies of Mr. Ben Ali defrauded the state of $1 billion to $2.6 billion over a seven-year period by avoiding import tariffs. Researchers investigated the dealings of 206 companies between 2002 and 2009. The findings represent one example of the cronyism that typified Mr. Ben Ali's 23 years in power and that was one of the main drivers behind the uprising that overthrew him in 2011. Protesters vented their anger against Mr. Ben Ali's family, and in particular his wife, Leila Trabelsi, a former hairdresser, and her businessmen brothers who had rapidly amassed great wealth. The scale of the corruption remains a concern not only for the money it has cost the Tunisian state, but also for the continuing damage that an unreformed and inequitable system does to the economy and to business in general. Hundreds of the family's companies that were confiscated after the revolution are now publicly traded. The family had amassed assets of $13 billion, according to officials in charge of the confiscation. Tunisia's anticorruption commissions, who have examined reams of documents impounded in the presidential palace, concluded that the entire system of governance under Mr. Ben Ali was corrupt and referred nearly 400 cases to the courts. Samir Annabi, who has led the National Anti-Corruption Authority for the past three years, said he was shocked by the extent of the graft and the legal manner in which Mr. Ben Ali had instituted it. ''I knew there was corruption, but not how it was in every field, and every part of the country,'' he said in a recent interview in Tunis. ''The system itself was corrupt, the entire way of governing the country.'' The World Bank had to review its own reporting on Tunisia, since for years its appraisals of the country's economic performance had been upbeat. Bank officials attribute their misreading of the level of the corruption to a lack of information available under the authoritarian government. The World Bank detailed how the system worked in a first report on corruption under Mr. Ben Ali last year titled ''All in the Family.'' Firms owned by Mr. Ben Ali and his family dominated the telecommunications and air transportation industries, as well as real estate and other sectors of transportation, and were extremely lucrative, the report found. By controlling the regulatory system of licensing and investment, the presidential family maintained a virtual monopoly in the sectors they chose, preventing competitors from entering the market and outperforming others in every aspect: employment, market share, profits and growth. Of the firms owned by the family that were confiscated, 220 accounted for 21 percent of all net private-sector profits in Tunisia, the report said. One example of the blatant use of regulations to remove competitors was the closing of a long-established private school, the Bouebdelli School, by the Education Ministry for not complying with registration regulations. The school was perceived to be in direct competition with the International School of Carthage, which was founded by the first lady, Ms. Trabelsi, the report said. Foreign investment was also strictly regulated. McDonald's was refused entry into the Tunisian market because it was unwilling to grant the sole license to a franchisee with family connections, according to the report. Presidential decrees, meanwhile, were issued that favored family members' business activities. In the latest research, economists studied a specific group of companies whose import dealings could be matched against international records. They identified 206 companies that were known importers from the 662 businesses confiscated from the Ben Ali family. They found that the companies had reported unit prices of goods arriving from abroad that were much lower than the prices declared by the companies exporting the same goods to Tunisia. Competitors' companies did not show the same trend, and state-owned companies tended to show overpricing of goods, suggesting a different type of misreporting or corruption. Since the confiscation and change of ownership, those companies no longer show such discrepancies, the report says. The underpricing of imports allowed the Ben Ali firms to circumvent taxes that amounted accumulatively to at least $1.2 billion over seven years, and as much as $2.6 billion. Data suggests that ''in 2009 alone connected firms evaded approximately $217 million worth of taxes more than other firms would have,'' the report states. Such estimates are conservative, Bob Rijkers, the main author of the report, said in a telephone interview. ''This number of 1.2 billion is illustrative of one practice among many,'' Mr. Rijkers said. ''And what is surprising is that this is just one mechanism and one vehicle for rent creation that they utilized, and this already is enormously costly.'' The damage of corruption to Tunisia has been immeasurable, not only in unpaid billions but in the stifled growth and the suppression of dynamic and talented entrepreneurs in favor of a system that rewarded those with connections, he said.

Wolfowitz from the World Bank has raised reasonable questions about whether the United States should continue to monopolize the nomination of presidents for that global institution. President Bush probably succeeded in curtailing the discussion yesterday by nominating Robert B. Zoellick for the job. Mr. Zoellick, who was U.S. trade representative during Mr. Bush's first term and has also held senior positions at the Treasury and State departments, is intelligent, experienced and effective; he has managed large bureaucracies and cut deals with governments from Latin America to China. He is a good choice to lead the bank; his American citizenship and identification with the Bush administration certainly should not disqualify him. Unlike Mr. Wolfowitz, Mr. Zoellick has a long history of commitment to multilateralism. As trade representative he helped to launch the ongoing global trade negotiations known as the Doha round and worked closely with his counterpart at the European Union, Pascal Lamy, now the head of the World Trade Organization. Mr. Zoellick's clear understanding of trade, and of how developing countries can use it to grow, should benefit the bank. So should his considerable experience with Africa, where he helped to broker peace negotiations in Darfur. If he is elected by the bank's board, the tricky challenges Mr. Zoellick will face only begin with restoring stability at the bank and successfully raising the $30 billion in fresh funds it needs to continue its grants and soft loans to the poorest countries. With global markets awash in capital, middle-income countries such as Brazil and China have much less need to borrow from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and some question whether institutions created to cope with the post-World War II world are still needed. In fact, as Mr. Wolfowitz recognized, the World Bank still has a vital role to play in Africa, not only as a source of grants and loans but as an aid to building institutions -- and, yes, in fighting corruption.  And it can still  do important projects in middle-income countries. For example, it can help to build a framework that would allow China, India and other rapidly industrializing countries to join rich nations in addressing climate change. It could help Middle Eastern countries participate in global flows of trade, investment and technology from which they have been largely excluded. If Mr. Zoellick can shore up the bank's place as a prime source of capital and technocratic guidance for the poorest countries and find new initiatives to pursue with the richer ones, he will have a chance of fulfilling the prediction he made yesterday: that ""the World Bank's best days are still to come."""31-Mar-12,UNITED STATES (94%); EUROPE (79%); COLOMBIA (79%); NIGERIA (79%),"President Obama's nomination of Jim Yong Kim to head the World Bank is an inspired choice. The South Korean-born medical doctor and president of Dartmouth College has a stellar reputation as a global health expert. Still, there is a problem: Since the bank was founded, all the presidents have been American. Emerging economies, which contribute increasingly to global growth, are rightly demanding a greater say in decision-making. The World Bank job -- and one at the International Monetary Fund, which traditionally goes to a European -- ought to be filled on merit alone. That should not exclude qualified Americans, but neither should it guarantee them a job. The bank needs a president with experience beyond Washington's narrow political and economic circles. Dr. Kim has worked on development in the poorest countries. One major success: leading a World Health Organization initiative that provided access to H.I.V. treatment to millions of people. The new president must also tackle broader issues of economics and growth, and manage the prickly political leaders who are the bank's overseers. That is why the bank board must take a serious look at Dr. Kim's strongest challenger, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Nigeria's finance minister. As a respected economist, diplomat and former World Bank managing director, she offers many conventional qualities of bank presidents. But she breaks the mold as a woman from an African country where she fought to reduce the country's debt, gain greater access to international credit markets and battle corruption. The other candidate is Jose Antonio Ocampo, the former Colombian finance minister and high-ranking United Nations official. He, too, is a credible contender with long experience in development and international policy. Robert Zoellick, who retires in June after five years, inherited a bank in serious trouble. He stabilized it, steered it ably through a global economic crisis and leaves it financially stronger, more focused and more inclusive -- a tough act to follow. Washington and Europe seem determined to ensure Dr. Kim's election. The bank will almost certainly do well under his leadership. But it would do even better if the process for choosing the next president were truly competitive and fully transparent."11-May-07,UNITED STATES (94%); EUROPE (94%); IRAQ (94%); ISRAEL (93%); EGYPT (93%); KOSOVO (92%); AFGHANISTAN (79%); SAUDI ARABIA (79%),"INTERNATIONAL A3-19  Bush Relaxes His Stance On Benchmarks for Iraq President Bush offered his first public concession to try to resolve the impasse over war spending, telling an aide to negotiate with Congress for firm goals to measure progress in Iraq.

''It was like pulling teeth,'' said Andre Arpaid, one of Haiti's largest industrialists, recalling trips he made in the past to promote Haiti among United States investors. ''They liked Haiti, but there was always this residual fear - dictatorship, bribes.'' Cheap Labor Supply Cited Now that Haiti is no longer a political outcast, Americans will take a new look at investing here, the executives said. Haiti, a two-hour flight from Miami, has a large labor pool available for $3 a day, they said. ''U.S. companies facing fierce competition with Asia for production of cheaper and better quality goods can come here,'' Mr. Levy said. About 200 American companies -largely manufacturers of sporting goods, clothing and electronic components - maintain assembly plants in Haiti. Among them are GTE, Sylvania, MacGregor Sporting Goods, United Technologies, Sperry Rand and General Motors. After the Duvaliers left, the United States Embassy here received a number of calls from American companies seeking information about setting up operations in Haiti. The $3 daily wage - generally considered the lowest in the Western Hemisphere - is the legacy of almost three decades of economic misrule by the Duvaliers. A Low Standard of Living ''Haiti in the mid-1950's was basically in the same category as South Korea,'' one foreign economist said of living standards. ''Since then, in many respects, the Haitian economy has not been a developing economy but actually an economy in decline.'' Statistics show that most of Haiti's 6 million people live in misery rarely seen outside of Africa. Haiti's per capita income is $379 a year. For the 75 percent of the people who live in the countryside, however, the figure is only $200. Unemployment is estimated at 50 percent. By comparison, the per capita income in Honduras, the second-poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, is $600 a year. The Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, has a per capita income of about $1,200 a year. According to a list of per capita income in nations of the world, as compiled by the World Bank, Haiti ranked 25th from the bottom in 1977 and 16th from the bottom in 1982. About 80 percent of Haitians are illiterate. One out of 10 babies dies before reaching the age of 2. Intense Cultivation Effort Only 30 percent of this Maryland-sized nation is suitable for agriculture, but 43 percent is under cultivation. Even so, one-third of the people in Haiti suffer from malnutrition. The nation has become a heavy importer of food. Through public and private aid, the United States feeds about 600,000 people here - one-tenth of the population. Such dire circumstances have caused an estimated one million Haitians to emigrate, mainly to the United States, Canada, the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas. Cuba is just 75 miles away, but few Haitians try to go there, and not many of those are allowed to stay. Amid emigration and domestic repression, the Duvaliers presided over this economic debacle for almost three decades. Development programs rarely went beyond slogans. Corruption thrived in an atmosphere free of accountability to the public. ''Look at this,'' a Haitian economist said, running his finger down a page of Haiti's 1985-86 budget. ''Special obligations - $36 million.'' Nowhere in the 800-page budget is there a definition of ''special obligations'' Absence of Public Services In a middle-class neighborhood here, a furniture manufacturer said, ''Every year, they come out here to collect our real estate taxes.'' Where the money goes is a mystery, she continued. Her neighborhood has no city water service, no public lighting and no paved streets. The pervasive corruption here led to tax dodging and flight of capital to shelters in the United States. ''We in the business community were not at ease paying taxes because they did not have to make any accounting,'' said Andre Arpaid Jr., who helps manage his father's electronic assembly business, Alpha Industries. ''With a democracy, there will be transparent accounts.'' Citing figures from the United States Federal Reserve and the Bank for International Settlements, one Haitian here has calculated that his countrymen hold $457 million in deposits in overseas banks. This total, he noted, does not include stocks, bonds, real estate or deposits by Haitians with dual citizenship. Money Sent by Emigrants The problem of capital flight is somewhat mitigated by overseas remittances from what is often called ''the Haitian diaspora.'' Emigrants send home about $125 million a year. Haiti's foreign-exchange position has been further hurt by a sharp slump in tourism. The number of visitors dropped from 250,000 a year in the early 1980's to fewer than 100,000 last year. After a boom in the 1970's, tourism nosedived when it was discovered that Haitians suffered from a higher rate of the disease AIDS than many other population groups. Of four Miami-based cruise lines that made weekly stops in Haiti years ago, only one still visits the country. Finance officials of the provisional Government said they had not completed an inventory of foreign-exchange reserves. But most economists here believe that Jean Claude Duvalier took as much money with him as he could. ''The week before he left, the request came from the palace to cough up whatever foreign exchange was left,'' the Haitian economist said. He said his information was gathered from local banking contacts. Skimpy Reserves Estimated The economist estimated that Haiti has $3 million to $5 million in foreign-exchange reserves - enough to cover two or three days of imports. An officer of a United States oil company that imports diesel oil, gasoline and kerosene, said, ''We have enough oil stocks to get us through February, but I wonder if there is enough money in the till to pay us after that.'' Texaco, Exxon and Royal Dutch/Shell have importing operations in Haiti. At a news conference after Mr. Duvalier left, President Reagan hinted that the United States might provide emergency aid to Haiti. Proposed aid to Haiti for the fiscal year 1986 is $53 million, about the same as last year. Virtually all this is earmarked for food, health and agricultural assistance. A banker here said he had heard that Haiti's new administration had asked for $20 million in emergency aid. American Embassy officials said the new Government had requested aid but had not mentioned an amount. Restoration of Momentum Business executives said the weeks of turmoil surrounding the end of the Duvalier regime would not leave a lasting dent on Haiti's economy. The airport was closed for five days, but most of the celebrations and settling of scores took place during the four-day Mardi Gras holiday, which ended last Tuesday. By Wednesday, Haitians who held jobs were back at work. ''We will be working Saturday, Sunday and overtime during the week to catch up,'' the elder Mr. Arpaid said during a phone call to a client in the United States. ''We will stand on our heads so as not to let you down.'' While the collapse of the ancien regime is not likely to solve the problem of Haiti's deep-rooted poverty overnight, business leaders here believe it will help Haiti join the mainstream of the Caribbean community. ''I'm very optimistic,'' the Haitian economist said. ''Haitians have not given themselves the opportunity to show what they can do.''"12-Apr-07,UNITED STATES (94%); IRAQ (92%); AFRICA (79%),"Growing hostility within the World Bank toward its president, Paul D. Wolfowitz, is raising questions about his ability to lead the big lending institution and raise money for a fund that assists the developing world. Wolfowitz's tenure, contentious from the start because of his earlier role as an architect of U.S. policy in Iraq, has been marred in recent months by a series of controversies. World Bank staffers disclosed that a woman with whom Wolfowitz is romantically involved received big pay raises from the bank. Sensitive board minutes regarding China have been leaked to the press, and blistering criticism has been leveled at Wolfowitz on an internal electronic bulletin board. The heightened tension comes as delegates from around the world convene in Washington this weekend for annual meetings of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and finance ministers for the major industrial powers. Wolfowitz sought to defray questions about the pay raises in a briefing with reporters yesterday and to focus attention on his priorities, which he has defined as dealing seriously with environmental problems, rooting out governmental corruption and fighting poverty, particularly in Africa. Wolfowitz noted that a committee has been appointed to review the situation involving Shaha Riza, to whom he has been romantically linked. ""I'm comfortable with that, and that's all I have to say on that,"" Wolfowitz said. ""I don't think its fair to the rest of the agenda to take up this valuable time with that."" Riza was transferred to the State Department shortly after Wolfowitz took over the World Bank in 2005, in accordance with conflict-of-interest rules. She is still paid by the bank and she has received raises that increased her pay to $193,590 from $132,660 after she was moved to the State Department in 2005, according to the bank's employee association. A Wolfowitz spokesman, who has previously said that Wolfowitz played no role in the raises, would not comment yesterday. Riza has made no public comment. There was no sign that Wolfowitz, who was appointed to the job at the recommendation of President Bush, was in imminent danger of being forced out. None of the World Bank's executive directors, who make up a 24-member board that governs the bank's operations along with Wolfowitz, have publicly withdrawn support. Board members have asked Wolfowitz to more clearly articulate the direction he intends to lead the bank for the rest of his five-year term, which ends in 2010. ""There are considerable questions about his leadership at the bank, and he faces some morale problems and questions coming from"" important member countries, said Edwin M. Truman, a senior fellow at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ""But I don't think that he's in jeopardy."" The 185-nation World Bank, which has a staff of 10,000 and lends about $20 billion a year to developing countries for projects such as classroom construction and the creation of financial systems, is carrying out a campaign to replenish the International Development Association fund, which lends money interest-free to the poorest countries. Raising the billions of dollars necessary to keep the fund running at its present level falls largely to Wolfowitz. Given the turmoil at the bank, some staff members have questioned whether rich countries would donate as generously to the fund as they have in the past. That is not likely to become clear until the end of this year, after countries announce their commitments. ""I think it will be a tragic mistake if the promise of increased aid is not delivered,"" Wolfowitz said. ""The U.S. should be a leader here. When it comes to IDA replenishment, frankly a lot of the donors are looking to see what the U.S. is going to do, particularly some of these small but relatively generous countries like the Nordic countries."" Even if Wolfowitz can manage to fill the fund's coffers, he has considerable mending to do inside the World Bank, said present and former staff members, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals or of offending Wolfowitz. Some staff members say Wolfowitz has lost their support, and an online discussion board on the bank's internal Web site has become a heated forum where critics have attacked Wolfowitz, especially over the issue of raises for his romantic partner. Posting anonymously, bank staffers have accused Wolfowitz of hypocrisy, noting that he has launched a campaign to root out corruption in the developing world even as he manages the bank in a way they view as corrupt. According to the World Bank Staff Association, Riza's pay increases violated bank rules that restrict the size of raises. Wolfowitz said in an e-mail to bank earlier this week that he will cooperate with an investigation by the bank's executive board. On other issues, senior bank officers felt compelled to defend a Wolfowitz decision to expand operations in Iraq after a staff driver was wounded in February at a checkpoint in Baghdad. Recent leaks of sensitive World Bank executive board deliberations to Fox News have fed the criticism. This week, bank officials said they hired a Washington law firm to hunt down the source of the unauthorized disclosures, which included an internal e-mail noting that the bank had received a warning from China that it might halt future borrowings if Wolfowitz refused to curb anti-corruption investigations. ""Critics, both inside and outside the World Bank, are openly questioning whether Wolfowitz's liabilities will undermine his leadership of the institution,"" said Manish Bapna, executive director of the Bank Information Center, a nonprofit organization in Washington that monitors the bank's activities. ""His relationship with staff, the board and with civil society remain highly strained, and some wonder what could even be done at this point to heal these festering wounds."""21-Oct-04,"UNITED STATES (94%); IRAQ (94%); BOTSWANA (91%); KAZAKHSTAN (79%); GAMBIA (79%); INDONESIA (79%); UGANDA (79%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%); AZERBAIJAN (79%); IRAN, ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF (79%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (79%); NIGERIA (79%); KENYA (79%)","Iraq, which was ranked among the world's most corrupt nations in a survey released yesterday, is likely to see rampant corruption in its oil industry and reconstruction efforts unless the United States, Britain and other powerful nations take aggressive steps to combat bribery and theft of public money, an international watchdog group warned. ''All the elements for a corrupt brew are in place,'' said Peter Eigen, chairman of the Berlin-based anticorruption group Transparency International, as it released its 10th annual ranking. Mr. Eigen, a lawyer who spent 25 years at the World Bank, ticked off the risk factors for Iraq: the oil industry, an element that has encouraged corruption in many countries; the lack of a strong civil society to hold the government accountable; a continuing armed conflict; and a rush to rebuild that could undermine anticorruption policies. Iraq was only one of many oil producers that the rankings found were plagued by corruption. The others were Angola, Azerbaijan, Chad, Ecuador, Indonesia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Libya, Nigeria, Russia, Sudan and Yemen. ''Our index simply shows practically all oil-rich countries, including Iraq, are doing much worse than countries without oil in terms of corruption,'' Mr. Eigen said. The rankings, which reflect the perceptions of business executives and country analysts, draw on 18 surveys conducted by 12 institutions from 2002 to 2004. Among those who produced surveys were Columbia University, the World Bank and the World Economic Forum. Transparency International estimated that at least $400 billion a year is lost to bribery in government procurement, which amounts to about 10 percent of the $4 trillion spent. Gambia, Tanzania and Uganda showed marked signs of improvement. Kenya, which emerged from the authoritarian rule of Daniel arap Moi in elections in December 2002, is also progressing, Mr. Eigen said. Botswana, a major diamond producer but an exception to the idea that corruption often accompanies natural resources, continued to make strides in providing clean governance, ranking 31st among 146 countries. ''Botswana shows systems and individuals can make a difference,'' Mr. Eigen said."15-Nov-05,UNITED STATES (94%); KAZAKHSTAN (79%); SAUDI ARABIA (79%); NIGERIA (79%),"To the dismay of anti-poverty activists worldwide, last week Congress gave the administration some $2 billion less than it sought to support aid programs in developing countries and U.N. relief efforts. But there's another source of ""aid"" these critics ought to consider: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC is doing far more to promote healthy economic growth in the world's poorest countries than any congressional appropriation or U.N. initiative could. The reason? Sarbanes-Oxley, the controversial 2002 legislation designed to prevent future Enrons, Worldcoms and Tycos, has become a powerful force for reducing graft and bribery in the Third World. Much to the surprise of corporate lawyers and good-governance champions, the law that chief executives  and their boards love to hate has conscripted the private sector as a partner in fighting global corruption. And corruption is the single largest obstacle to economic growth in poor countries, according to the World Bank. When it was passed in the wake of corporate scandal, Sarbanes-Oxley's potential impact on global corruption wasn't even an afterthought. But by requiring corporate directors and CEOs to personally certify their companies' internal controls  --  and by criminalizing false certifications  --  the law inadvertently fostered a new industry of global compliance auditors. In the United States, these auditors identified fraudulent ""special purpose entities"" that permitted Enron to shift losses off its balance sheets. In the rest of the world, they sniffed out the ""offshore intermediaries"" that helped companies seeking to sidestep provisions of the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibiting payoffs to foreign officials. The result has been a sharp increase in the number of companies ""discovering"" questionable or illegal payments overseas. The number of government investigations into potential FCPA violations more than doubled from 2002  -- the year Sarbanes-Oxley was enacted  --  to 2004. Previously the government initiated most of these inquiries, but today's investigations are generally triggered by ""self-reporting,"" which strongly suggests that more companies are cleaning up their overseas acts. As a result, many of the world's best-known companies are changing the way they operate in the developing world. Bristol-Myers Squibb disclosed an SEC inquiry into payments by the company's German subsidiaries. Lucent employees were accused by the SEC of paying off Saudi Arabian government officials. Halliburton revealed that employees may have bribed Nigerian officials in connection with a liquefied natural gas facility. The SEC charged ABB's U.S. and foreign units with paying $1.1 billion in bribes to officials in Angola and Kazakhstan between 1998 and 2003. Aggressive enforcement is the logical extension of U.S. policy to improve governance and transparency in the developing world. Corruption destroys confidence in markets and jeopardizes the integrity of nations. It is a regressive tax on the poorest of the poor. Corrupt governments  --  governments whose officials ignore laws or, worse, violate them with impunity  --  undermine our own laws and defy our stated policy. Through support of the Millennium Challenge Account and aid programs in the Middle East, this administration has, with bipartisan backing, clearly shown the links between transparency, the rule of law, free markets and democracy. But these new programs are dwarfed by the size and scale of the private business activity in the targeted countries. U.S. policy has wisely recognized that American business  --  companies protected by our laws and funded by our public markets  --  can reinforce healthy transparency through its commercial and investment practices. If the FCPA enlisted companies as foot soldiers in the global war on corruption, Sarbanes-Oxley has drafted their CEOs and corporate directors as senior officers. This alone should cause Congress to resist efforts to repeal or weaken Sarbanes-Oxley. Yes, compliance undoubtedly imposes costs, but building a global community of governments that value transparency and the rule of law is a good strategic investment for American business. At the same time, this administration and its congressional allies must push other industrialized countries to aggressively engage in the fight against corruption. As things stand, U.S. companies that comply with Sarbanes-Oxley compete at a disadvantage against European and Asian firms for which bribes and payoffs are just another business expense. That is politically and economically indefensible. The certification requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley, warts and all, demonstrate how corporate power can effectively be aligned with public policy to fight global corruption. Rather than removing or limiting them here, we should be promoting them abroad.

Untangling criminal webs that have crippled aid efforts will take years, the leaders said. One solution that has been raised at the United Nations, an international convention against corruption that would demand clean government and the return of stolen funds, seems as quixotic as a decree outlawing greed, lust and the other deadly sins. But the first step has been taken: institutions like the United Nations and the World Bank are acknowledging that corruption is a factor and aiming to control it, said Ruth Jacoby, Sweden's ambassador to the United Nations and an author of the Monterrey Consensus, the agreement on increasing aid to poor nations that is a focus of this conference, which runs through Friday. ""A half decade ago, one didn't speak of corruption -- it was considered offensive,"" she said. People are talking now. They see bribery and corruption as ""grave obstacles"" to development, said Shamshad Ahmad, Pakistan's United Nations ambassador, also an author of the Monterrey Consensus. The United States demands that poor nations cleanse their governments as a condition for new aid promised last week by President Bush. The problem is not simply crooked politicians, though it begins there. Bad governments tend to deepen their peoples' poverty. Poor nations lack banking and financial regulations, a working tax system or a judiciary. They cannot easily enforce the law, clean up graft or inspire confidence in investors. For rich nations, aid has often been a political tool, supplied with a blind eye to corruption. During the cold war the United States supported rulers like Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, accused of stealing billions, because they were seen as bulwarks against Communism. Today, the global political equations have changed: aid will be considered well spent if it prevents states from collapsing into ""havens for terror,"" Mr. Bush said Thursday. He said, however, that the United States would demand that states remove ""gantlets of bureaucracy and bribery"" to receive American aid. But ""the biggest demand for an end to corruption,"" said Nitin Desai, the United Nations under secretary general for economic and social affairs, ""is in the countries affected by it."" The horror stories are famous in aid circles: fortunes stolen by crooked Russian politicians and businessmen; millions sent to Bosnia that vanished; thefts and kickbacks within the Palestinian Authority. There are tales of the international airport built in the remote Kenyan hamlet that happens to be President Daniel Arap Moi's hometown, and the Mercedes fleet purchased by the leaders of Malawi. Aid officials argue that these tales of theft are exceptions, not rules, and should not make donor nations disregard the real reductions in poverty and infant mortality, and the increases in life expectancy and literacy, that their aid has bought over the years. ""No one says we cannot have a defense budget, or spend an additional $48 billion on weapons this year, because someone bought a thousand-dollar teapot,"" said Mark Malloch Brown, the head of the United Nations Development Program. The United Nations is asking the world's rich nations to increase their international aid by a roughly equal sum, about $50 billion a year. James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, says rich nations should attack corruption by helping poor ones train civil servants and build schools. Every nation, the United States included, has had ""to struggle against extreme corruption,"" he said. ""This battle never ends."" The battle has been joined since 1993 by Transparency International, a global anticorruption group with offices in 80 nations and leaders who are veterans of aid wars at the World Bank and the United Nations. Their work includes roughly 100 ""integrity pacts,"" like an open bidding process on a Karachi water project that cut projected costs by tens of millions of dollars. But the group's vice chairman, Frank Vogl, said, ""There still is a taboo about discussing this problem, to some extent."" He cited the example of the arms trade. ""Countries with incredibly limited resources, that can't provide medical care to their citizens, are spending huge amounts on arms,"" he said. ""That's taboo. Nobody's going to talk about defense spending by developing countries, though there's massive corruption involved in the arms trade."" Public outrage against corruption has toppled regimes in places like the Philippines. But in the poorest nations, powerlessness prevails among the poor, making aid honestly delivered and spent all the more crucial. Critics of World Bank lending say it too could be more transparent. They say the bank prefers huge construction projects like dams and pipelines, easier to defraud than smaller-scale programs. Instead, they say, the bank should focus on a few grand goals, like universal access to primary education and prenatal care, while clearly favoring nations less corrupt or repressive than their neighbors."23-Apr-06,UNITED STATES (94%); PHILIPPINES (79%); CZECH REPUBLIC (79%); IRAQ (79%); AFRICA (79%); INDIA (72%),"At the opening of the annual spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on Thursday, a small group of protesters chanted, ''Corporate corruption, who can we thank?/ The I.M.F. and the World Bank!'' In less than a minute, security guards hustled the noisy protesters out of the news conference. That the moment, captured in Webcasts, fizzled so quickly was a sign of the surprising lack of controversy surrounding the 10-month tenure of Paul D. Wolfowitz as president of the World Bank, one of the most important antipoverty institutions. Mr. Wolfowitz, a former Pentagon official who became a lightning rod for criticism of the Iraq war and who was mocked by filmmaker Michael Moore in ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' for fussing with his hair, has defused much of the opposition from advocacy groups. Early in his tenure, he worked behind the scenes to push for debt relief, a cause popularized by the rock star Bono. On Friday, he announced that he had enough votes from bank shareholders to approve $37 billion in debt relief to 17 of the world's poorest countries, mostly in Africa. ''He didn't have to do that,'' said Max Lawson, a policy adviser with Oxfam. Mr. Wolfowitz has laid claim to the mantle of anticorruption crusader. In recent months, he has blocked or canceled more than $1 billion in loans to a range of developing countries. But he has done it in a way that appealed to both conservatives, who worry that aid is disappearing down a rat hole, and to anticorporate activists who fear that it is being stolen from the poor by corrupt rulers and the businessmen who bribe them. He has also on occasion shown a willingness to nip the hand of the Bush administration that used to feed him -- a tendency that has lessened suspicions that his appointment to head the World Bank would simply impose American interests. At a news conference on Friday, he gently chided the United States for the relatively small sums it gives to help educate the 100 million children in the developing world who are not in school. Certainly there is harsh criticism of Mr. Wolfowitz, but it seems tempered by a sense that his approach offers a chance for change at the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a lumbering institution often berated as secretive, bureaucratic and ineffective in dispensing billions of dollars in very low interest loans each year to poor countries. At a bacon-and-eggs news conference on Friday morning at the Old Ebbitt Grill, a clutch of advocacy groups -- with leaders from India, the Czech Republic and the Philippines -- laid out some of their recommendations for reform. The bank needs stronger protections for its own whistleblowers, they said. It should forgive debts incurred by thieving dictators. Its lending should be subjected to parliamentary oversight in developing countries with vital democracies. And it needs to even more comprehensively investigate allegations of corruption, especially those involving multinational corporations. ''This is a very important window in which we're making a number of constructive suggestions,'' said Smitu Kothari, director of Intercultural Resources, a New Delhi-based nonprofit research group. While Mr. Kothari did not criticize Mr. Wolfowitz's decision to hold up $660 million in lending to support India's health programs for women, children and victims of tuberculosis because of corruption in drug procurement, India's health minister, Dr. Anbumani Ramadoss, called the action unfair. India is the bank's largest borrower. That decision might once have prompted India, famously prickly about foreign hands in its affairs, to spurn Mr. Wolfowitz and his loans. But the new India, deeply engaged with the United States, is trying to accommodate him. ''I've done everything the World Bank asked,'' Dr. Ramadoss said during a telephone interview on Thursday. ''I have blacklisted all the companies they wanted. I've suspended officials there at that point in time.'' As well as highlighting his anticorruption theme, Mr. Wolfowitz has emphasized another cause during these spring meetings -- education. This week he appeared on a panel with Gordon Brown, th chancellor of the exchequer in Britain, and Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the Nigerian finance minister, to discuss education aid. Mr. Brown, who last week announced that Britain was committing $15 billion to education in the coming decade, four times what it spent in the past decade, said, ''It is one of the world's greatest scandals that must now be addressed that 100 million children are not going to school today.'' Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala began by telling how she had recently adopted a 17-year-old girl who had never had a chance to get an education, and who is now being privately tutored. The Nigerian minister said children needed to be able to read and write if they were ever to escape poverty, and invited donors to contribute to help education in the developing world. When the panel was asked who the laggards were among the donors, the audience tittered, and Mr. Wolfowitz took the question. He praised the British and the Dutch for their outstanding contributions. As for the United States, he said, it has raised its spending on education from about $100 million in 2002 to $260 million in 2004. ''If you stop and think about it, that's about $1 per capita, whereas I think the U.K. number is now up to $20 per capita,'' he said. ''So the U.S. could do a lot more.''"7-Jul-02,UNITED STATES (94%); UGANDA (68%),"After plunging to some of their lowest levels in more than four years early last week, stock prices came roaring back from July 4 with the kind of muscle not seen since the rebound from the post-Sept. 11 slump. The absence of any big terrorist attack over the holiday, plus fresh forecasts of a turnaround in computer-chip sales, helped spark Friday's 325-point rally in the Dow industrial average, more than wiping out the losses from earlier in the week. With investors waiting for the next corporate scandal to break, however, nobody was willing to declare that the market had bottomed out. Amid signs that consumer spending may be lagging and interest rates would remain low for at least another couple of months, the Big Three automakers announced they were bringing back the interest-free financing that generated record sales last fall. General Motors, which alone among the U.S. automakers is profitable and increasing its market share, led the charge. Ford and Chrysler, still struggling to return to profitability, reluctantly followed suit. European and Asian automakers, meanwhile, continue to take a greater share of the U.S. market. The latest blow to Arlington-based AES Corp. came last week, when the World Bank held up $ 370 million in loans and guarantees for a dam the company had proposed to build across the Nile River in Uganda. The bank acted after AES informed it that an executive of its prime contractor for the project may have passed a $ 10,000 bribe to a Ugandan official several years ago. Already facing financial troubles because of soured investments in other countries, AES recently replaced its chief executive and announced plans to cut capital spending and sell assets. It's becoming clear that the Bush administration believes the best way to restore confidence in corporate America isn't to impose intrusive new regulations on businesses but to put misbehaving executives behind bars. The SEC last week announced that it would require CEOs to personally attest to the accuracy of their corporations' financial statements, in effect subjecting them to prosecution if the statements are false. And in a speech Tuesday on Wall Street, the sheriff in chief is expected to call for tougher criminal sanctions for executives who violate the public trust."21-Apr-90,"UNITED STATES (95%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (94%); ROMANIA (94%); AFRICA (92%); ANGOLA (79%);","Mobutu Sese Seko seized power in Zaire through a military coup in 1965, the same year Nicolae Ceausescu became the Communist boss of Romania. Mr. Mobutu is no Communist. But his methods of rule resemble those of the executed Romanian tyrant. Wholesale repression, corruption and megalomania have deformed Zaire. There is a further regrettable resemblance. President Mobutu, like Mr. Ceausescu, has known how to profit from his outspoken opposition to Soviet foreign policy moves. Washington has winked at his disastrous misrule and made his regime the leading African recipient of United States economic assistance. The end of the cold war removes any possible justification for this taxpayer subsidy to a repellent dictator. Representatives Howard Wolpe of Michigan, Stephen Solarz of New York, David Obey of Wisconsin and Ronald Dellums of California are proposing changes in the aid relationship. Their efforts deserve support. American aid dollars have not measurably helped Zaire's people. Annual per capita income is about $150; living standards are lower than when Mr. Mobutu took power. His Government has not built a single hospital in its 25 years. Only 3 percent of Zaire's budget goes to health and education while 23 percent goes to the military and 50 percent to ''political institutions.'' Meanwhile Mr. Mobutu's personal fortune has, by some estimates, grown to $6 billion. His holdings include perhaps a dozen French and Belgian chateaus, a Spanish castle and a 32-bedroom Swiss villa. Mr. Mobutu protests that his fortune is a mere $50 million, and that none of it has come out of the pockets of his people. But recent World Bank studies have found hundreds of millions of dollars in mineral revenues unreported in the national budget, and more gold and coffee smuggled out of the country than legally exported. Mr. Mobutu has supported anti-Communist initiatives of successive U.S. Administrations, especially in Angola. But he has done so for his own reasons, not always in coordination with Washington. For him the U.S. has proved a useful ally. He uses his conspicuous access to American leaders to further discourage dissent. Mr. Solarz, Mr. Wolpe and Mr. Obey would end military aid to Zaire and channel most economic aid through non-government organizations. Mr. Dellums would go further and press international aid institutions to consider the abuses and corruption in Zaire. Americans have better uses for their tax dollars than reinforcing the Mobutu tyranny."11-Mar-83,"UNITED STATES (95%); INDIA (94%); IRAQ (93%); IRAN, ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF","As well-heeled officials from 101 primarily third-world nations parade across the podium making pious declarations about peace, global crisis and economic development, the temptation is great to dismiss the nonaligned movement as a hypocritical farce. A quarter century after Jawaharlal Nehru, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Kwame Nkrumah and Josip Broz Tito sought to give newly independent nations an alternative to following the United States or the Soviet Union, the history of this third-world movement is marred by failure, betrayal and broken dreams. As nonaligned membership has grown to 101, the movement has increasingly lost its original meaning. How seriously can one take denunciations of the United States by military elites in countries such as Syria and Iraq whose survival is based on paid bodyguards and repression, and by notoriously self-indulgent and corrupt leaders such as Zaire's Mobutu Sese Seko? How can members such as Vietnam, which is dependent on Soviet aid, talk about the ideal of nonalignment? What does economic independence mean when countries from Argentina to Zaire are teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, surviving on bailouts from frightened Western banks and the International Monetary Fund? Surely Nigeria's mass expulsion of illegal aliens and the brutal Iran-Iraq war give the lie to the nonaligned profession of third-world solidarity. But hypocrisy and rhetoric notwithstanding, the real failures of the movement do not negate its ideals. The nonaligned countries need a genuine alternative to the hard political realities of superpower rivalry and a lopsided interdependent economic system. Third-world countries must somehow cope with record low commodity prices - the lowest they have been in 30 years - and a protracted recession that has curbed their ability to repay their debts. The passing of the nonaligned chairmanship from Cuba to India presents the United States with an opportunity to rethink what it can to do about the political and economic issues facing the nonaligned. The nonaligned countries' rhetorical condemnation of the United States - for intervention in Central America, for its support of Israel and its military presence in the Indian Ocean - may be hard to swallow. But such --------------------------------------------------------------------- Robert A. Manning writes on foreign affairs for magazines in the United States and abroad. charges contain at least a kernel of truth, and on a number of substantive issues the nonaligned countries' position is far from inimical to American interests. The United States should welcome the mediating role that the non-aligned movement has played in the Iran-Iraq conflict. Most of the real and potential conflicts that we hope to prevent and contain with the Rapid Deployment Force and our burgeoning military network in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean stem from regional ethnic, economic and political problems that cannot be solved by military force. Perhaps we should revive the Carter Administration's efforts to negotiate a demilitarization of the Indian Ocean. We would also do well to heed the nonaligned warning that American ascendancy in the region would provoke a Soviet reaction - like the growing Soviet presence in Syria today - and produce a dangerous rivalry. The most pressing issue being addressed at the nonaligned conference is also of vital concern to the United States - the global financial and economic crisis. The nonaligned countries' outstanding debt of more than $600 billion gives them a new leverage, and their proposal to link the debt crisis to reforms in the international financial and economic system could help boost American economic recovery. Increasing aid flows, stabilizing commodity prices, boosting multilateral institutions such as the World Bank, curbing protectionism and creating a new system for debt repayments would bolster sagging third-world economies. The less-developed countries already account for more than one-third of American exports, and a boost to their economies would mean new markets for American goods, thus spurring recovery. Finally, Indira Gandhi has made disarmament a major theme of the nonaligned conference, and a non-aligned call for a nuclear freeze could help the United States curb nuclear proliferation. Many potential third-world nuclear powers - India, Pakistan, Argentina, Libya and Iraq - are nonaligned members, and holding them to a nuclear freeze, including a comprehensive test ban treaty, might help considerably to deter proliferation. On these key issues, American and nonaligned objectives overlap. Like previous Presidents, Ronald Reagan pays lip service to nonalignment. But aggressive support for these complementary objectives would bolster America's security and help to curb Soviet influence."5-Feb-89,UNITED STATES (95%); JAMAICA (94%); CARIBBEAN ISLANDS (92%); AFRICA (79%); CENTRAL AMERICA (77%); CUBA (77%);,"In a few days, Michael N. Manley, who challenged United States policies in the 1970's and tried to bring democratic socialism to Jamaica, expects to once again become Prime Minister. The country's leading poll taker, Prof. Carl Stone, is predicting that Mr. Manley's group, the People's National Party, will win 48 of the 60 seats in Parliament in voting on Thursday. The incumbent, Edward P. G. Seaga, who was President Reagan's closest ally in the Caribbean, says that he is not as far behind as Mr. Stone's polls indicate and that the election ''could go either way.'' At a rally this week in the southern-coast town of Savanna-La-Mar, thousands of cheering supporters filled the main street and mobbed Mr. Manley's campaign van. ''These are the kind of crowds you get when you are winning by a landslide,'' Mr. Manley told a reporter as he prepared to join the sea of people. ''It's a wipeout, if you want to know. It's not even going to be close.'' The two rivals are foreign-educated members of Jamaica's elite. Mr. Seaga graduated from Harvard, Mr. Manley from the London School of Economics. On the podium, Mr. Seaga fires off statistics and lists of accomplishments. Mr. Manley beguiles listeners with mellifluous phrases and sweeping generalities. In 1980, the last time they confronted each other in an election, something approaching civil war broke out. More than 750 people were killed. Mr. Manley boycotted a 1983 election in a dispute over voter registration. Since this year's campaign began three weeks ago, eight people have died in scattered violence. Mr. Seaga has accused Mr. Manley of planning to escalate the violence and Mr. Manley says Mr. Seaga's Jamaica Labor Party intends to stuff ballot boxes and intimidate voters with gunmen. Both leaders, who in August signed an agreement to try to restrain their backers, deny the accusations. Mr. Manley says he is a different man today from the radical Prime Minister who flaunted his friendship with Fidel Castro, nationalized farms and companies and opposed the United States in Africa and Central America. In an interview, Mr. Manley said that though he would eventually restore diplomatic relations with Cuba, he would not have an intense relationship with Havana that might make Jamaicans or United States officials uneasy. His first priority in foreign affairs, he said, would be to go to Washington to meet with President Bush, the State Department, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. As a result of heavy borrowing by Mr. Manley and Mr. Seaga, Jamaica has a foreign debt of slightly more than $4 billion, one of the largest in proportion to population. More than 40 percent of the country's foreign-exchange earnings are being consumed by the debt. Impovements for the Well-to-Do In Mr. Manley's bid for re-election nothing has been more important than the economy, which severely eroded in his tenure, partly because of mismanagement, critics say, and partly because of the international oil crisis in which the price of crude oil rose from $3 a barrel to more than $30. The economy has been recovering under Mr. Seaga. Unemployment has fallen. Well-to-do Jamaicans are investing, construction is booming and the two main industries, tourism and bauxite mining, are thriving. But the majority of Jamaica's 2.3 million people are poor and few of Mr. Seaga's improvements have trickled down to them. Their purchasing power has stagnated or diminished. Schools and hospitals are crumbling and lack basic supplies. Jamaicans, rich and poor, recall the shortages of food and gasoline in the last days of Mr. Manley's rule and they say the schools and hospitals were in bad shape then, too. But the poor best remember Mr. Manley's social efforts, such as the setting of a minimum wage, free secondary and university education, a literacy program and subdivision of idle land for peasants. Many things Mr. Manley tried did not work. But the poor say that he tries to protect their interests and that Mr. Seaga's main concern is for the rich."20-Nov-05,UNITED STATES (95%); LIBERIA (94%),"KORTO'S PLACE, an airy restaurant and banquet hall stuck into the back of a fading yellow building near Bay Street and the Staten Island Railway tracks, is almost as big as a warehouse, but it has only seven tables. Some are covered in zebra-print tablecloths, others in a design emblazoned with black-and-white cowry shells, and the walls are painted white and a dull sky blue. Yet it is not the decor that provides the excitement; it is the food and the conversation. Over bowls of superior fufu, oxtail stew and red pepper soup made with succulent meats, the Liberian community in the Stapleton section of Staten Island regularly collects at Korto's. At $6.50 a plate, it's not a bad way to fill one's stomach and one's head with the issues of the day, both at home and abroad. Not surprisingly, the talk at Korto's these days has focused on Liberian's recent presidential election, a contest that pitted Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the country's Harvard-educated former finance minister and a former economist at the World Bank, against George Weah, a former striker for the soccer powerhouse A. C. Milan. Though voting took place on Nov. 8, Mr. Weah has leveled charges of fraud in the vote count, which was heavily in Ms. Johnson-Sirleaf's favor. An investigating commission is expected to conclude its work this week. Though Mr. Weah's case may not succeed -- international observers have said the elections were conducted fairly -- he retains a fan base, many of them young, in Stapleton. He lived there once himself, in a house said to be a few blocks off Bay Street, Stapleton's main shopping street. He is known universally among local Liberians and soccer fans worldwide as Oppong, after one of his middle names. ''Liberians love him,'' said Jacob Massaquoi, who moved to Stapleton from Liberia in 2002 and helped start African Refuge, an immigrant services group. ''People look at him as a mentor. The youth look at him as a mentor. He was a very good soccer player.'' Despite this reservoir of affection, support for Mr. Weah on the island is not universal. Many in the community have also voiced support for Ms. Johnson-Sirleaf, Mr. Massaquoi said, and the debate has centered partly on the issue of which candidate was more likely to pursue war crime tribunals against those who took part in the nation's latest civil war, which lasted 14 years and ended in 2003. For Mr. Massaquoi, who said he left his home country after surviving torture and brutalization, there is no question that tribunals are the answer. For others, like Ms. Johnson-Sirleaf, the need for such trials is less important. Some Staten Islanders, feeling the country is safe again, are already packing their bags and heading back to Liberia. On Hudson Street, near the foot of the grand hill of Victorian homes that rises over this neighborhood, there are already signs of exodus. At Christ Assembly Lutheran Church, a bagel-factory-turned-house of worship, more than 75 percent of the congregation is from Liberia. During Sunday services, worshipers sing, clap and dance in the aisles in front of the Liberian flag, whose single star and stripes are a visual tribute to the American flag. ''They rejoice by dancing,'' said the Rev. Philip S. Saywrayne, himself a native of Liberia and the church's pastor since 1995. Mild-mannered and dressed this day in a blue button-down oxford shirt and black pinstripe pants, he said the church ''brings a different dimension of life to them.'' ''Some of them thought they wouldn't meet anybody here,'' he added, ''or anybody to embrace them.'' After services conclude comes the Passing of the Peace, when all the members of the congregation, usually about 350 people, shake hands and chat. Until a few days ago, the talk was largely about the election, Pastor Saywrayne said, but now that it is over, nearly all the people he has spoken to say Ms. Johnson-Sirleaf won, fair and square. And a few are preparing to join her. ''No place like home, they said,'' according to Pastor Saywrayne. Just last week, he helped one happy parishioner pack her things. It is a small migration, one back to a country that was founded in 1847 by freed American slaves who had made a very different ocean journey. Now that the election is over and the country again appears without torment, some natives will return. Others will remain on Staten Island, another community they hope to keep strong.

Yet Washington's reluctant decision to withdraw a team of financial advisers from Liberia a year early could send a strong signal to others who would shamelessly abuse American aid. Gen. Samuel Doe's Government has thwarted the advisers' efforts to combat wide corruption. For them to stay would only countenance more of it. But the best way to get the message across would be for the new administration and Congress to further cut back American aid. Freed American slaves founded Liberia in 1847 and their descendants long ran it. America remains Liberia's largest foreign investor and trading partner. The Voice of America has a transmitter in the country, and U.S. military planes use its international airport. General Doe's bloody 1980 coup displaced the American-descended ruling clique. But under President Reagan, who once introduced the general as ''Chairman Moe,'' the relationship grew even warmer. Foreign aid was dramatically increased. During the Reagan years, nearly $500 million flowed from Washington to Monrovia, making Liberia the largest per capita U.S. aid recipient in sub-Saharan Africa. But very little of that aid ever reached the population. Well-connected Government employees have wallowed in luxury consumer goods and built foreign bank accounts. After a fraudulent election and an attempted coup in 1985, Congress put the brakes on U.S. aid. Payment arrears have jeopardized further help from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Last year, an embarrassed Reagan Administration sent in the financial experts. They worked hard but were ignored. Those in the Doe group seem interested only in helping themselves at Liberia's expense. There's no finer place to start cutting the U.S. budget deficit than by cutting them off at the pockets."13-Jul-03,UNITED STATES (95%); LIBERIA (95%); AFRICA (91%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%),"It seems like yesterday -- even though it was 1996 -- that I was tiptoeing along the darkened hallways of the presidential mansion in Monrovia, holding a small torch as I made my way to meet Liberian warlord Charles Taylor. His rebels jostled one another as they led me along. Taylor was then a 48-year-old bush soldier who had battled his way to the capital with a loaded bandoleer wrapped around his chest. Taylor was the Big Man in waiting, the latest aspirant to the ranks of self-ordained African leaders. This was a club that once included independence leaders with their own high-minded, if terribly misguided, theories about development. But over time, Africa's Big Men had been corrupted. And new Big Men came, less visionary, more dictatorial. In Liberia, it had come to this: A former security guard in Boston had murdered and cajoled his way within a whisper of genuine power. And there I was, in his bombed-out mansion, which sat in a kind of daylight truce zone of Monrovia, while fighting went on in the countryside by day and seemingly everywhere at night. There being no glass in the windows, velvet curtains swayed to reveal azure skies as Taylor sat there, a man who badly wanted to be president. Taylor shared the mansion with five other warlords, but he impressed many as the most ""presidential."" He was dressed in an eye-catching two-piece gray suit that buttoned at the neck. (The junior college he attended in Boston in the 1970s specialized in fashion design.) He always kept a valet in his employ, even when he was deep in the bush. The valet was Edmund Lewis, whom Taylor had recruited from the streets of Roxbury in Boston. Taylor, who had lived in Boston again in the mid-1980s, went tight-lipped when I asked about his 1985 escape from a Massachusetts prison, where he was being held for possible extradition to Liberia on embezzlement charges. But he talked about a lot of other things that day: New England, the Boston Celtics, his family and his reverence for the post-colonial leaders of Africa. He waxed on with stories of America's hold on the imaginations of himself and his countrymen as he was growing up. He mentioned the name ""Paul Cuffe,"" a name I'd never heard. Cuffe, a wealthy merchant and Quaker from New Bedford, Mass., was one of the first black Americans to steer a vessel across the Atlantic. Convinced that emigration back to Africa was the way for American blacks to realize full self-determination, he transported 38 black Americans to west Africa in 1815. In 1822, the American Colonization Society began to resettle free American blacks in Liberia. The settlers became known as Americo-Liberians. The Liberian constitution was modeled after America's. The capital was named after President James Monroe. The colors of the country's flag were red, white and blue. When independence washed across Africa in the 1950s and '60s, Liberians watched with pride and some bemusement: Freedom had been theirs for more than a century. So they went about their business, much of it linked to U.S. interests. Since 1926, Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. had a million-acre rubber plantation there. In 1943, the U.S. dollar became the legal tender. Coca Cola Co. had a big bottling operation. The 1960s were the halcyon years of African independence, when the Big Men emerged as leaders. Among them were Jomo Kenyatta in Kenya, Felix Houphouet-Boigny in the Ivory Coast, Julius Nyerere in Tanzania, Kenneth Kaunda in Zambia and Joseph Mobutu (later Mobutu Sese Seko, the ""sole guide"") in Zaire. Liberia's Big Man was William V.S. Tubman, its president from 1944 to 1971. Tubman was a big man because he was big with America, having allowed the CIA to use his country for a major spying station. But something foul had been brewing since shortly after the first black Americans landed in Liberia. A caste system grew, pitting Americo-Liberians against the native, indigenous population, notably the Krahn tribe, but the Gio and Mano as well. It was a kind of big city versus rube separation. Nelson Taylor, Charles Taylor's father, was proud that his family -- just like Tubman's -- belonged to the Americo-Liberian group. When Tubman died in 1971, William R. Tolbert, his vice president and another Americo-Liberian, assumed the presidency. Tolbert had dreams: He courted both China and Cuba. He called it diversifying his country's political ambitions. But jumping into bed with communists bewildered America, and was hard for Liberians to grasp. On April 12, 1980, Tolbert was murdered by Samuel Doe, a semi-literate sergeant in the Liberian Army -- and a Krahn. Doe became the first native Liberian to assume the presidency. (In 1982, Doe was invited to the White House, where President Reagan called him ""Chairman Moe."") But Doe unleashed a reign of terror. Less than two weeks after his coup, he had 13 members of the Tolbert government executed on the beach. They had been stripped, save for underpants, tied to posts, then shot. Doe also seemed to be trying to match Mobutu's bizarre eccentricities. He kept caged lions at the presidential mansion and let a white horse run free on the grounds. Doe terrorized many Liberians, seeking vengeance on behalf of the indigenous population. His adversaries set their sights on ousting him. Taylor, who had been politically active among Liberian exiles, returned to the country on Christmas Eve, 1989, and began his war. Doe kept Monrovia fortified and the fighting was waged in the bush. On July 30, 1990, however, a convoy of Doe's troops attacked St. Peter's Lutheran Church in the heart of Monrovia. Americo-Liberians had felt safe there with their children. When I visited the church, a priest told me 700 had died in that massacre. Among them was Taylor's father. Taylor swept through the bush, recruiting boy soldiers for his ragtag forces, firing old cannons from hillsides. Industries, along with many Liberians, fled to surrounding countries. On occasion, U.S. Marines were called in to evacuate American embassy personnel; Liberians would collapse on the beach, wailing that the American forces should repatriate them, owing to their ancestral links to America. The war became mind-boggling, with touches of Graham Greene, Chester Himes and George Orwell woven together. Former president Jimmy Carter tried hard to broker peace agreements. When I visited in 1996, fighting had already claimed more than 150,000 lives. One afternoon, I rode around with the ""Skeleton Team."" It was no team, just a lone truck driver assigned to collect skulls on the beach. That evening, I returned to the beach. A young woman came running in my direction and began yelling that I must leave because snipers came out at night. Her name was Rose and she was 19. She desperately wanted to go to college in America. Her birthday was a couple days away and all she wished for was a chocolate cake. Later, I found a former hotel cook, who was delivering wood and scrap metal. He said he could bake one if I found some flour, which I did. He gave me the cake inside a shoe box, and I took it to Rose. I used to hear from her after I left Liberia, but then the calls stopped. I wonder if she still looks out for anyone foolish enough to waltz along the beach. With elections in 1997, Taylor finally got his official claim to the presidential mansion. In time, Mobuto's walking stick became Taylor's walking stick. The Big Man grew adept at walking hard and carrying a big stick. And riding in big shiny cars. Even when I was in Monrovia, before he became president, a fleet of beautiful cars ferried Taylor and his cronies up and down the capital's dusty roads; the crowds nearly trampled over themselves to get a glimpse of him. But he, like Doe, stayed close to Monrovia, fearing insurgents plotting in the countryside. And he meddled murderously in neighboring Sierra Leone. By supporting the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Taylor prolonged a civil war in which thousands were murdered, raped, terrorized and pressed into forced labor. A U.N.-backed war crimes indictment claims Taylor backed the RUF while pillaging Sierra Leone's diamonds, which he and his cronies pocketed. Liberia is now left with an entire generation without proper education or much hope for its future. When I traveled with Taylor's boy soldiers into the bush -- a lovely land that reminded me of the way the countryside looked around my grandmother's farm in Georgia -- I listened to them at night as they would well up in tears. They'd wonder where their parents might be. But when morning came, their cockiness returned and they readied their rifles. For years one of the commandments of Big Man rule has been: Thou shall not criticize another Big Man. From his bush wars to his presidency, Taylor was rarely condemned by other African leaders, even though his presidency has been disastrous, with declining health care, falling incomes and the ruination of his country's infrastructure. The reigns of Sani Abacha in Nigeria and Mobutu went on far too long. And now, says the recent war crime indictment handed down, so has the rule of Charles Taylor. The U.S. government can ill afford to turn its back on Liberia again lest it become a haven for terrorists. That means more than just making Monrovia safe, a task that will require African peacekeepers, backed and coordinated by the U.S. military. The United States should also create an interdisciplinary committee to revive the country. It might include the likes of former congressman Ron Dellums; former governors Thomas Kean and L. Douglas Wilder; ""Dead Man Walking"" author Sister Helen Prejean; a player from Liberia's roster of exiled soccer stars; and a World Bank or International Monetary Fund representative. The King Center in Atlanta could join the effort. It could be a second coming of Americans, like those who ventured to Liberia's shores so many years ago. As for Charles Taylor, he has begun to sound like a butler battered during a dining room scuffle. He says he will simply retreat to Nigeria -- to write and perhaps reemerge in due time. His rescuer is another Big Man, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo. Obasanjo commands enormous respect in Africa, which is why Taylor may be willing to step aside. Plus, Obasanjo has said he will ignore Taylor's war crimes indictment. Sitting in that bombed-out mansion, Charles Taylor had sounded so hopeful, so dreamy. Coming through the bush to stop the beheadings of his people, he may truly have believed in his cause. But he appears to have suffered from a familiar African malady: A dream of the heart swallowed whole by the darkness of the mind.

The plan, disclosed at the 22d annual summit meeting of the Group of Seven countries, would allow the United States and other countries to post investigators on foreign soil and would require the seven allies to crack down on the import and export of firearms. The plan was under development before the terrorist bombing on Tuesday that killed 19 American servicemen in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. But President Clinton, seizing the moment to drag along allies who have often been reluctant to agree on concrete steps that impinge on their national sovereignty, pressed to tighten some of the provisions. Some of the steps, originally packaged as a broader anti-crime initiative, appeared aimed more at drug dealers and corrupt business executives than at terrorists. But Administration officials pointed to requirements that nations coordinate prosecutions when crimes occur across borders and that they ""insure that criminals and terrorists are brought to justice and tried"" even if extradition proves impossible. The other members of the Group of Seven -- Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan -- are also bound to develop witness protection programs, much like the one used in the United States, to give new identities to people who testify against organized crime groups. While they were eager to portray the agreement as major progress, Administration officials conceded today that turning those general agreements into national laws and regulations would be a long struggle. ""These are countries that often can't agree on the rules for selling planes to China or moving lumber across borders,"" a senior Administration official said tonight. ""We'd be fooling ourselves to think any of this will happen instantly. But it's a start."" An example of the complications over extradition was unfolding in Rome as the leaders gathered: this week, Italy's constitutional court blocked the extradition to Florida of a man wanted on charges of first-degree murder because he could face the death penalty. Italian law does not permit the death penalty. The anti-crime and anti-terrorism principles would require major changes in Italian and Russian laws, and major changes in common practices elsewhere. For example, the new rules call for all the G-7 nations to strengthen ""laws to prevent bribery and extortion."" While that sounds non-controversial, until a few months ago German companies paying bribes abroad were permitted to deduct them from their taxes. The most visible divisions among the leaders were over American efforts to isolate Iran, Libya and Cuba and over strategies to relieve the world's poorest nations from their huge debt loads. Several leaders chastised Mr. Clinton for signing legislation that would punish foreign companies that do business with Cuba and for announcing that he would go along with a bill approved by Congress a week ago that would similarly penalize companies that invest in Iran and Libya. At a briefing for reporters today, Daniel Tarullo, a top official of the National Economic Council, said that ""the President pushed back fairly hard,"" telling the allies that they needed to ""confront terrorist states to take action against countries that are threats to democracy and to the safety of our citizens."" Separately, a dispute flared over a plan pressed by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin to arrange for the International Monetary Fund to sell part of its $40 billion in gold reserves. The proceeds of a sale of $2 billion to $3 billion in gold would be invested in interest-generating financial instruments, and the resulting income would be used to pay off debt for third-world countries without requiring donor countries to allocate more resources to pay off the loans. The World Bank would pay off roughly $2 billion, and individual nations would forgive other debt as part of a larger initiative. After a lengthy struggle with countries opposed to the plan, led by Germany, the United States won wording in the economic communique that Mr. Rubin said would allow the gold sales to move forward after the I.M.F.'s annual meeting in the fall. ""We've all agreed that the I.M.F. should fund this primarily through its own resources, and we've all agreed to optimizing the assets of the I.M.F. to do so,"" Mr. Rubin said. But just before he spoke, the German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, insisted that the wording of the communique would allow the sale of gold to be blocked. Germany has steadfastly insisted that the gold reserves should be held for true emergencies. Further sparring broke out over Mr. Clinton's presentation about the halving of the Federal budget deficit and the creation of 9.7 million jobs by the American economy. President Jacques Chirac of France, where unemployment rates are running upward of twice the level of those in the United States, acknowledged that ""the U.S. has created a lot of jobs,"" but added, ""A lot are underpaid ones that we wouldn't find acceptable in Europe."" The leaders will meet again on Saturday, the last day of the conference. Mr. Clinton will then travel to Paris for dinner with Mr. Chirac, and later fly to Florida for a Sunday memorial service for those killed in the attack in Saudi Arabia."8-Jul-00,UNITED STATES (96%); BOSNIA & HERZEGOVINA (93%); RWANDA (92%); SWITZERLAND (90%); MARSHALL ISLANDS (79%); FRANCE (71%); ISRAEL (68%); BELGIUM (56%);,"AIDS Report Dims Hope For Protection of Infants A study of AIDS infection among infants, sponsored by the United Nations, has dashed the hopes of scientists who thought they had found a simple way to prevent mothers from giving their infants the AIDS virus during breast-feeding. ___A1  Missile Defense Test Fails In a major setback for the Clinton Administration's plan to build a missile shield to protect American soil from enemy attack, a missile fired from the Marshall Islands in the Pacific failed to hit a mock warhead launched 4,300 miles away in California.___A1 Criticism of Rwanda Inaction The United States and other nations and institutions that failed to prevent or stop the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 should pay a ""significant level of reparations,"" an independent panel said.

Mobutu Sese Seko said in an interview that Americans should instead focus on his Central African nation's ''true human rights drama'' - the burden of repaying the foreign debt. Mr. Mobutu, leader of one of Africa's most populous nations and a close ally of the Reagan Administration, said he came to the United States ''to say goodbye to President Reagan.'' In the capital this week, members of Congress are expected to question him about reported human rights abuses, and international bankers are expected to press him to maintain payments on Zaire's $7 billion foreign debt. ''It's an interference in Zaire's internal affairs,'' Mr. Mobutu said of a bill in the House of Representatives to end military aid and to condition further economic aid on improvements in Zaire's human rights situation. The measure, sponsored by Representative Ronald V. Dellums, Democrat of California, has 37 co-sponsors. The Zairian President seemed unperturbed about the threat to this year's American assistance, which consists of $3 million in military aid and $60 million in economic aid. ''I'm going to see 200 Congressmen - I have a good case,'' President Mobutu said. He was interviewed at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, where he was surrounded by his traditional totems of power: a leopard-skin hat and his carved walking stick. The African leader is also expected to discuss debt relief in talks scheduled with President Reagan and with officials of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. ''If we don't watch out, North-South relations are heading straight for catastrophe,'' Mr. Mobutu said, referring to difficulties that third-world countries encounter in servicing their foreign debts. From 1983 to 1986, he said, Zaire paid $2 billion, or half the money it receives from exports, for interest on its loans from foreign sources. In that period, he said, the country received $1 billion in new loans and investment. ''Zaire became a net exporter of capital,'' he said. ''When the poor give more to the rich, do you call that human rights?'' Critics of Mr. Mobutu, including Representative Dellums, have charged that corruption and mismanagement have undermined Zaire's ability to pay off the debt. Turning to other topics, Mr. Mobutu rejected accusations by Angolan officials that the Reagan Administration has used bases in southern Zaire to train and arm Angolan rebels. Asserting that Zaire was made a ''scapegoat'' for the spreading rebellion by the anti-Marxist National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, Mr. Mobutu repeated an earlier offer to open his largest base, Kamina, to permanent international inspection. Estimating that the rebels control one-third of Angola, Mr. Mobutu said that their arms in fact come from South-West Africa, the South African-administered territory also known as Namibia. The leader of the Angolan rebels, Jonas Savimbi, is expected to visit New York and Washington later this month."12-Oct-03,UNITED STATES (96%); HAITI (95%); IRAQ (93%); AFGHANISTAN (79%); LATIN AMERICA (79%); CARIBBEAN ISLANDS (79%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (79%); AFRICA (79%),"President Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, declared in talking about U.S. policy in Iraq: ""When Americans begin a noble cause, we finish it."" Former secretary of state Madeleine Albright echoed Rice's words in Foreign Affairs magazine, writing that Democrats ""believe in finishing the jobs we start."" The experience in nearby Haiti refutes both of their claims. It has been nine years since President Bill Clinton ordered U.S. soldiers into Haiti to replace a military junta with elected president Jean Bertrand Aristide. During that span, Haiti and its 8 million people have fallen deeper and deeper into misery. Its economy is stagnant and its political institutions are broken. The Bush administration's top Latin American official, Roger Noriega, blames Haiti's plight on its leadership. He is mostly right. The government of Haiti -- led by Aristide in 1994 and 1995, then by his handpicked successor, Rene Preval, and again by Aristide since 2001 -- has been the biggest culprit in the country's unrelenting deterioration. Indeed, the withdrawal of most foreign support was provoked by the Haitian government's failure to uphold the rule of law or conduct fair elections. Still, no one can argue seriously that the United States came even close to completing the job it undertook in Haiti. A recent Rand Corp. study concluded that the Clinton administration and Congress never put in the resources required and pulled the plug too early. the United States essentially gave up on Haiti after only a few years of ""nation building"" -- it pulled out its peacekeeping troops, stopped collaborating with the country's embryonic police force and pared financial aid way back. Just like Iraq and Afghanistan, Haiti desperately needs an engaged United States to stem its slide toward becoming a failed state. Its rates of illiteracy, malnutrition and disease put it at the same level as sub-Saharan Africa's drought- and war-ravaged nations. As food shortages and unemployment worsen, a refugee emergency for Florida and many Caribbean countries may be in the making. A several-fold expansion of international aid will be required to make even modest progress in controlling widespread hunger and malnutrition, providing basic sanitation services, preventing the spread of diseases such as HIV/AIDS, combating illiteracy and reducing joblessness. There are good reasons for cutting off aid to the Aristide government, including its manipulation of election results, intimidation of opposition leaders and endemic corruption. But the extreme destitution of ordinary Haitians makes withholding support a callous instrument for promoting political change. This argument is beginning to take hold in some quarters. With the encouragement of the Bush administration, the Inter-American Development Bank is once again lending to Haiti, and the World Bank may soon follow suit. True, safeguards are required to ensure that aid money will not be misused, wasted or stolen by inept and corrupt officials, but that set of problems is not unique to Haiti. Aid organizations face such concerns in virtually all of the world's poorest countries. Perhaps more important than aid, a pending bill called Haitian Economic Recovery and Opportunity Act is awaiting congressional approval. This would extend trade preferences to Haiti's apparel industry -- helping to propel job growth and economic expansion. Right now, Haiti's most vital political task is to hold clean and credible elections. Its constitution calls for legislative elections by the end of this year and a presidential race in November 2005 -- a little more than two years away. If the presidential election is conducted lawfully, Haiti will have a new leader in 2006, since Aristide, having served two terms, is constitutionally barred from ever running again. Sure, his party could win and he will almost certainly retain some political clout, but once he is out of office, his hammerlock on Haitian politics would end. The political process in Haiti has been stalled since 2000, when the government rigged the results of legislative elections, and opposition candidates (and most Haitians boycotted the presidential vote later that year. Absent a solution to Haiti's bitter political deadlock, the country will remain ungovernable and impoverished. For the past several years, Washington, rent by partisan divisions and unable to come up with a coherent policy approach of its own, has turned for help to the Organization of American States (OAS). The OAS has worked diligently and creatively to find a way out of Haiti's political crisis. But it cannot succeed unless it has the full, unambiguous backing of a U.S. government that speaks with a single voice. But Haiti is also an important test of whether the governments of the hemisphere are truly committed to protecting and advancing democratic rule -- an objective to which they all pledged when they signed the so-called Inter-American Democratic Charter on Sept. 11, 2001. Haiti is not just Washington's problem; every nation in the Western Hemisphere is tarnished by Haiti's deepening distress. Nothing can ever be guaranteed in Haitian politics, but it should surely be possible to hold an honest election in Haiti -- one in which the government cannot manipulate the vote, where opposition candidates can compete on a level field, and whose results are widely accepted as legitimate. The OAS and the United Nations know how to manage elections in difficult situations, and they will know what to do in Haiti. But, to make the elections work, efforts have to begin almost immediately -- two years is just not that much time to prepare. One prerequisite is enhanced security so candidates can campaign without fear of intimidation, and journalists, election officials and private monitors can do their jobs safely. No one in the opposition trusts the Haitian government to provide the needed security -- indeed, the government is viewed as a dangerous source of bullying and intimidation. But even if the government truly wanted to ensure a secure election, it doesn't have the resources or personnel. The Haitian National Police force is understaffed, badly trained and riddled with corruption. The United States and other nations will have to provide and equip a security force, perhaps of 1,000 persons or so. Credible elections will also require a substantial team of foreign observers, technical assistance for the electoral authorities and a reliable mechanism for settling disputes. Estimates put the cost of all this at upward of $50 million. Ideally, the international community would help get the congressional vote on track. But whatever happens in the coming year should not obscure the main priorities -- dealing with Haiti's humanitarian crisis and working toward an honest, fair and democratic presidential election in 2005, in accord with the constitutional timetable. That is what is most crucial for Haiti's future. Regarding Iraq, President Bush has said he wants to finish the job America started. The people in Haiti deserve no less.

At one unauthorized polling place set up today at Army barracks in downtown Monrovia, voters were free to cast as many ballots as they wanted. There were no registration lists. Some election workers, handing out ballots from briefcases, made no attempt to verify if the recipient previously had voted. This came under the watchful eyes of khaki-clad soldiers and observers wearing campaign T-shirts and hats bearing the initials of the political party headed by Samuel K. Doe, who for five years has been the military leader of Liberia and is one of four candidates for president. Observers from the other three parties were not present, as is required by election regulations. At two rural polling places north of this port capital, voters in the town of Kakata were not allowed to mark their ballots privately, as required by election regulations. In one bamboo school house there, voters were required to call out their choice for president in a room filled with government officials. ""These are clear violations,"" said Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, a senatorial candidate for the opposition Liberian Action Party. ""It was very clear in the election rules that nobody was to be in the presence of the voter. The ballots at the Army barracks should be declared invalid,"" she added. Despite these irregularities, which were witnessed by this reporter, observers from opposition parties reported a large turnout across Liberia and said a majority of polling places were properly supervised. The U.S. government, long a major benefactor of this impoverished country founded in 1847 by freed American slaves, is watching today's election with particular interest. Ever since former Master Sgt. Doe and 12 of his colleagues overthrew the government, killing the president and more than two dozen other officials, the United States has been lobbying to return Liberia to elected civilian government. To that end, it has courted the former noncommissioned officer who has promoted himself to general. In long one-on-one sessions, an American ambassador here for years tutored Doe in the art of statecraft. Doe was invited to the White House to meet President Reagan. To improve his English, Doe studied videotapes of Reagan's speeches. Washington increased aid six-fold to Liberia, making this country of just 2 million people one of the highest per-capita recipients of U.S. assistance. Assistance, which averaged $15 million a year before Doe, is $86 million this year. For his part, Doe espoused strong anticommunist policies and rhetoric and said he was an admirer of all things American. According to diplomats, he watched Reagan's speeches via a satellite dish installed on the lawn of his mansion. The result of the American largesse was to come with today's election of a civilian leader. For more than two years, the U.S. State Department believed that Doe would not be a participant. Early in his tenure as head of state, Doe had led American diplomats here to believe he would turn power over to a civilian government and return voluntarily to his Army barracks. But to the chagrin of the Americans, Doe last year declared that he would run for the presidency. Since then, he has presided over a strong-arm campaign. His government has banned the candidacy of his two strongest challengers, jailed and allegedly flogged dozens of political opponents, shut down newspapers and invoked a decree that allows the arrest of anyone who spreads ""rumors, lies and disinformation."" According to documents here, civil servants have been ordered to campaign in support of Doe's party, the National Democratic Party of Liberia. They also have been ordered to give contributions to that party. A ""task force"" of burly young party militants, including paid recruits from neighboring Sierra Leone, has beaten and intimidated opposition political workers across the country. Members of the task force presided, along with soldiers, over the unauthorized voting at the Army barracks in Monrovia. The Special Elections Commission of Liberia, in its published list of official polling locations, did not mention that voting would occur at the barracks. Last week Doe warned on Liberian state radio that if he did not win the election, the Army would revolt within two weeks. The results of today's voting are expected to take two weeks to be counted. The three civilian presidential candidates who have been permitted to mount campaigns say they are far more worried about intimidation at the polls and election fraud after the polls close than they are about Doe's popularity with voters. Political observers and diplomats here say that the opposition Liberation Action Party, whose candidate is Jackson F. Doe (no relation to the head of state), has a strong support among Liberia's 751,000 voters. There are no nationwide polls in this rugged and undeveloped country where large numbers of voters live two days' travel from a paved road. But an official in Doe's Ministry of Information conceded that the head of state probably would lose in a ""free and fair election."" Samuel K. Doe, who was thought to be 33 but allegedly changed his age to 35 so he would be eligible under the constitution to run for the presidency, has conducted an election campaign that appeared as much designed to alienate voters as win their confidence. In July, he announced a 25 percent salary surtax, with the proceeds to go for a new studio for the national radio station. Market women, an important political and economic force in Liberia, have been forced to join Doe's party or close their shops. Even the Army, Doe's base of power, has been irritated by a mandatory $5-a-month tax that went to support Doe's campaign. A long series of government arrests, disappearances and beatings has brought expressions of U.S. concern and cast doubt on Doe's willingness to leave office if he does lose. Cherbutue Quayeson, an opposition candidate for the new civilian legislature, says he was stripped of his clothing in an Army barracks Sept. 30 and given 50 lashes with a cowhide whip. The 40-year-old high school principal and member of the opposition Liberian Action Party said last week that his crime was to march with other opposition candidates in Zwedru, a town in Doe's home county, Grand Gedeh. Quayeson, whose back is badly scarred, said soldiers broke up the march, and searched house-to-house in Zwedru for politicians who had fled. The government has said the march was dispersed because it was illegal and caused a disturbance. Quayeson said he had received permission from the county superintendent for the march and that it was peaceful. ""I was hiding in a friend's house behind a locked door when they burst the locks,"" he said. ""I was told to lie on the ground. A solider stood on my head. The pain was unbearable."" After being flogged along with 14 other members of his party, including four women, Quayson said, he was jailed until last week. The most notable jailing of an opposition politician occurred in July when senate candidate Johnson-Sirleaf was charged with sedition for referring, in a speech in Philadelphia, to the ""many idiots in whose hands our nation's fate and progress have been placed."" Johnson-Sirleaf, a former World Bank economist and one-time finance minister in Liberia, was later sentenced to 10 years in prison. Under pressure from the U.S. government and several African leaders, Doe two weeks ago released Johnson-Sirleaf, along with several other political opponents. Within 24 hours of their release, the State Department released $25 million in economic aid that had been withheld because of concern over human rights violations and economic mismanagement in Liberia. Congressional language in the 1986 foreign aid bill threatens to cut all U.S. aid to Liberia if today's election is not judged to be ""free and fair."" That assessment will be made by American diplomats here, who sent nine teams of observers. Johnson-Sirleaf said today the key to the fairness of the election is what happens to ballots once polls close. ""If they count the ballots on the spot, with our observers watching, then our fears are minimized,"" she said. But, if ballots are not counted before being returned to election headquarters in Monrovia, she said ""there is no way we can control the fraud."""21-Sep-09,UNITED STATES (97%); AFRICA (96%); RWANDA (94%); GHANA (92%); KENYA (79%),"Africa and the United States may be on the verge of a new partnership, not one of dependency and aid but one of shared ideas, vision and investments that increase our mutual prosperities. To begin this improved relationship, both must accept urgent and substantial changes in the nature of our bond. Africa needs to acknowledge a key tenet of President Obama's July address to Ghana's parliament: that a vibrant private sector is critical for capable, reliable and transparent societies. Without a dynamic private sector, no society can prosper. The African continent has been slow to foster conditions that build active private enterprise. Africa must adopt policies that strengthen governance and promote economic growth to create conditions for a strong and innovative private sector. These are the most durable strategies for advancing socioeconomic transformation. Like all nations, my country is not perfect, but Rwanda continues to build strong foundations for stability and improve standards of living for all of our people. This has led to greater social integration and gender equity. Rwanda has leveraged the contribution of women for its productivity and prosperity; ours is the only country in the world with women as a majority in parliament. Rwanda has moved from instability to reconciliation and sustainable development largely through our Vision 2020 strategy. The primary principles of this strategy include macroeconomic stability; wealth creation to reduce dependence; and a shift from an agriculture-based economy toward a knowledge-based economy, with a vibrant service sector. We have enacted and consistently enforce a rule of law that counters corruption and supports our ambitious reform agenda. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton acknowledged our progress, and the importance of ""policies based on evidence and measurable results,"" during an Aug. 5 speech in Kenya. Rwanda's ranking as the top global reformer in the World Bank Doing Business 2010 report illustrates what can be achieved with vision and engagement. The recommendations in President Obama's July 11 address are as pertinent for the United States as they were for Africa. Africa's prosperity, he said, ""can expand America's prosperity. [Its] health and security can contribute to the world's."" The link between the U.S. economy and African markets is critical, especially given global economic conditions and the potential Africa represents as a profitable new market. It is no longer enough for the United States to work for Africa based on pity; the United States must work with Africa to build both our economies and improve the lives of all of our people. The United States has long supported assistance to Africa. The United States must recognize that Africa is now in a position to be of assistance to the United States. It is time to acknowledge our mutual reliance with clear actions. Yes -- Africa must improve its governance institutions and embrace private-sector development. We appreciate the African Growth Opportunity Act and acknowledge that Africa has not fulfilled its potential; African countries should take responsibility for shortfalls in their efforts and take greater advantage of opportunities under this act. Meanwhile, the United States should increase financing to U.S. companies wishing to do business in Africa through  key financial institutions such as Export-Import Bank of the United States and the Overseas Private Investment Corp.  The United States has committed less to African markets than the emerging economies of Asia have; China guarantees nearly 30 times more in loans for investment in Africa than the United States does. Africa's needs are so great that there is ample room for both U.S. and Chinese investment. Increased U.S. investment in Africa would translate into more opportunities for U.S. companies, with high potential for profit flowing back to the U.S. economy. The United States should also support regional initiatives in Africa. Africa's economic development does not stop at national boundaries. Our markets need to be connected by better roads, by canals and ports, and through new technologies. Yet few U.S. companies are competing for large-scale and regional projects. The development of regional trading pacts similar to the North American Free Trade Agreement is among Africa's highest priorities. Regional development would better allow U.S. products and companies to reach beyond individual countries to greater markets without the burden of tariffs and legislative burdens. As I meet with President Obama and other world leaders this month at the U.N. General Assembly in New York and the Corporate Council on Africa's U.S.-Africa Business Summit in Washington, I will remind them that development assistance to Africa is important but that the best type of aid leads to investment in national infrastructure and private-sector reinforcement. Without a vibrant private sector, there can be no economic growth or development. If the U.S. private sector played a greater role in Africa, mutual development would follow. To achieve this, the Obama administration must facilitate U.S. investment in Africa, and African leaders must attract greater U.S. investment by consolidating our institutions for effective governance.

Mr. Nguza, a major Zairian diplomat and political figure off and on over the last two decades, said President Mobutu is aware that he cannot expect to cling to power much longer without the support of outside forces. ""He knows he is now at the end,"" Mr. Nguza said. ""He knows that all his friends in the West want him to step down."" In an interview, Mr. Nguza, who became Prime Minister in November, the third in three months, said that after months of political and economic chaos, the President fears only two things: ""bullets and being brought to court."" The Prime Minister has had a long, troubled relationship with the President. He served in his Cabinet and as an Ambassador, but also became the object of the Zairian leader's wrath, and was for a time under death sentence. He was incarcerated in President Mobutu's prisons. He acknowledges that friends often say his career ""has gone like a yo-yo."" Now, he says, the President knows him well. ""He knows I am not going to harm him,"" he said. ""He knows I would allow him to go in dignity."" The President is widely known for his lavish style of living and for corruption in his Government. Mr. Nguza said the President is apprehensive about being forced into exile. ""He knows what happened to the Shah,"" the Prime Minister said. ""He knows what happened to Marcos."" This week in Washington, Mr. Nguza asked the World Bank and International Monetary fund to send teams to run Zaire's central bank and tax system as a step toward reforming the economy. He said today that his request had been granted and that two Zairian officials would remain here to work out details. A Warning About Violence Mr. Nguza, who came to the United States a decade ago as an exile to seek, and be denied, backing against President Mobutu, returned to Zaire in 1985 and gradually reconciled himself with the President, a man Washington regarded as an ally against the leftist Government in Angola. Mr. Nguza served as Zaire's Ambassador in Washington from 1986 to 1988, and then Foreign Minister. He was Prime Minister briefly in 1980. He said that if President Mobutu is forced from office violently, the country will face civil war because all those who benefited from the President's rule will fight to retain their wealth and privileges. Poorly paid soldiers who went on looting rampages in September would be certain to join in the fray, he predicted. Mr. Nguza said that he hoped that Zaire could avoid the violent ""Liberian model"" of political change and instead follow the ""Zambian model."" In a multiparty election in October, Zambia's President, Kenneth D. Kaunda, accepted his loss at the polls and stepped down immediately, allowing a smooth transition of power to the winner, Frederick J. Chiluba."13-Mar-95,UNITED STATES (97%); EGYPT (96%); ISRAEL (93%); MIDDLE EAST (93%);,"The scene last week was a familiar one, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and an American secretary of state, side-by-side in the glittering reception room of Ittihadiya Palace. And as usual, Warren Christopher made sure to put in a good word for his host. It was, Christopher said, ""not an accident"" that many of his 12 trips to the Middle East have begun with a visit to Mubarak, one of America's strongest allies in the region and a longtime partner in the search for Middle East peace. But if Mubarak still wins plaudits from the West, his record at home is far less certain. After 14 years in power, the Mubarak regime is foundering, beset by bureaucratic paralysis, cronyism and widespread allegations of corruption, including charges against members of Mubarak's family. Economic reforms have slowed or stalled. Mubarak's claims of ""democratization"" have been undermined by his brutally efficient crackdown on Islamic militants and, more recently, political opponents who share their goal of an Islamic state. The security campaign has been effective: At least for now, militant violence has been contained to several provinces in rural Upper Egypt, and the all-important tourist industry is starting to rebound after two disastrous years. But the government's record in attacking the social causes of the unrest looks far less impressive. Despite the infusion of $ 35 billion in American aid over the last 17 years, most Egyptians seem to have little to show for it. Half of them still cannot read. Unemployment is stuck at 17 percent. Living standards have eroded. The population, meanwhile, is projected to swell from 60 million today to 104 million by 2025. Even Mubarak's relationship with the United States has hit a rough patch. He has irritated American officials by threatening to withhold support for extending the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty if Israel does not sign the accord, as Egypt has. U.S. officials, who have not pressed Israel to sign the accord, say Egypt's failure to support its extension could cause it to unravel. Perhaps the biggest uncertainty for Mubarak is whether popular discontent could seep into Egypt's 400,000-man army, which so far has remained above the political fray despite some erosion of status and benefits over the last several years. ""You can see in the streets that people are suffering, and possibly that is a greater threat to the stability of the regime than a few gun-toting militants,"" said a Western diplomat who asked not to be identified. ""There's no delegation of responsibility. There's no motivation of the work force, and power is concentrated in the hands of very few people."" Western governments have long enjoyed a close relationship with Mubarak, a former air force chief of staff who was vice president under Anwar Sadat and took over as president upon Sadat's assassination in 1981. He supported the peace process and backed the U.S.-led coalition to oust Iraqi forces from Kuwait in 1991, providing it with crucial political cover. On the domestic front, Mubarak established a reputation as a largely benevolent dictator, known to agonize over the social costs of tiny adjustments in food or gas subsidies. He presided over major improvements in roads, sewers, telephones and other amenities of modern life, many paid for with U.S. aid. But change has come far more slowly to the country's political institutions. Some of Mubarak's cabinet ministers have served for a decade or more. The ruling National Democratic Party dominates the country's parliament, and Mubarak has shown scant interest in allowing that to change. The party has huge advantages over its competition, controlling the distribution of patronage jobs and favors as well as broadcast media, of paramount importance in a country with 50 percent illiteracy. From all indications, moreover, the regime is moving to tighten its grip, ruling out a slate system in parliamentary elections next fall that some opposition leaders contend would have given them a better chance. ""They're centralizing control,"" a Western diplomat said. Mubarak sometimes seems to run the government almost single-handedly, personally approving major investment projects and, in one recent case, issuing an order for playground equipment in rural villages. He recently told an Egyptian newspaper that he keeps up with popular concerns by chatting with people who call his private telephone line by accident. But to his critics, that claim only reinforced an impression of imperiousness. ""He has no advisers,"" said a former intimate of the regime who asked not to be identified. ""Since the gulf war, the president has tended to tell people what to do. He has become a very bad listener. He has become cocky. Ruling Egypt looks very easy to him."" Mubarak's popularity has not been helped by pervasive rumors about the business activities of senior officials and their relatives, including Mubarak's two sons, who many Egyptians -- and some diplomats -- believe have gotten rich off commissions from companies that do business with the government. Government spokesmen deny the charges and say they are circulated by political opponents to discredit the regime. The government's biggest handicap may be inertia, a weakness that shows up most clearly in the economic realm. In exchange for promises of debt relief, Egypt has embarked on a program of economic restructuring. By most accounts, the government got off to a promising start, curbing inflation, cutting budget deficits and removing some trade barriers, among other things. But the regime has so far failed to follow through on the toughest part of the program, selling off inefficient public-sector factories and businesses that are a legacy of Egypt's Soviet-style, centrally planned economy. So far, only a handful have been turned over to private ownership. Government officials say the delay reflects Mubarak's naturally cautious style and a pardonable concern with avoiding massive layoffs. But Western experts cite another reason: resistance from managers and company board members, many of them retired military officers or others with close ties to the regime, who want to preserve their salaries and perks. ""The more time passes, the more we are concerned,"" said the manager of a Western bank here. ""We don't see things happening."" But Mubarak shows no sign of having lost his appetite for grandiose projects, such as a planned bridge over the Suez Canal, despite the skepticism of economists who note that the canal already can be crossed by a tunnel. The government's desperately overmanned bureaucracy, meanwhile, continues to deter foreign investors. Importers complain that 22 signatures are required to liberate a food shipment from Egyptian customs, and legal disputes can drag on for a decade or more, in part because Egypt's non-computerized courts shut down during the summer because of a lack of air conditioning, according to a World Bank report on obstacles to private investment in Egypt. Security is one area where the regime has proved capable of decisive action. But the cost has been high in terms of abuses such as torture, extrajudicial killings, imprisonment without trial and mass arrests in villages suspected of harboring militants, according to human rights groups and the State Department's 1994 survey of human rights worldwide. The government recently has expanded its campaign to include not just the militants but its main Islamic fundamentalist opposition, the Muslim Brotherhood, whose middle- and upper-middle-class membership also dominates professional unions for lawyers, doctors and engineers. Security forces have arrested several dozen Muslim Brotherhood leaders and rank-and-file members, holding them under emergency laws that permit detention of suspected terrorists. The government also has gone after the unions, passing a law to place union elections under supervision of the judiciary in an apparent bid to diminish the influence of the Islamic fundamentalists. ""The government cannot beat us in elections, so they're hitting us below the belt,"" said Salah Abdel Kareem, a British-educated aerospace engineer, as plainclothes security men patrolled the sidewalk outside the headquarters of his union recently. He estimated that 80 percent of the union's governing board are Islamic fundamentalists. The government campaign appeared to cross a threshold with the arrest last December of Adel Hussein, a prominent writer and general secretary of the opposition Labor Party, which is closely tied to the fundamentalist movement. Prosecutors said Hussein was arrested following the discovery of militant literature on an airline seat he had occupied on a flight from London. Hussein denied the charge. A Western diplomat noted that the arrest came shortly after Hussein wrote an article attacking official corruption. Hussein was held in Cairo's infamous Tora prison, where, he said in an interview, he stayed for the first two days in a lightless cell with no mattress, a filthy toilet and single blanket. Conditions gradually improved following international press coverage of his confinement, he said, and he was released after 24 days. ""Everyone understood that it was meant to scare the opposition,"" he said. ""It meant that a new phase has started."" Government officials acknowledge as much. They say Mubarak and his advisers concluded six months ago that the Muslim Brotherhood's claims of moderation were disingenuous, since it shares the militants' goal of an Islamic state. ""These people can be much more dangerous than bullets. Why? Because they are spreading the concepts,"" said Nabil Osman, chairman of Egypt's State Information Service. ""Their claim of moderation -- it's lip service."" Few suggest the regime is in imminent danger. The army, Mubarak's main pillar of support, continues to enjoy such perks as discount loans for automobiles and apartments and access to 32 private clubs and hotels in Cairo, according to sources close to the Egyptian military. Mubarak approved a pay raise last year despite the budget deficit. But pressures on the army are likely to intensify, especially if the United States reduces its $ 2.1 billion annual aid package, more than half of which goes to the military. The sum covers 56 percent of the military budget, said a source close to the military."30-Apr-04,UNITED STATES (97%); GERMANY (93%); JAPAN (92%); EUROPE (92%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (88%); LATIN AMERICA (79%); ASIA (79%); AUSTRALIA (79%); INDONESIA (79%); ITALY (79%); GUATEMALA (79%); ZIMBABWE (79%); KENYA (79%); AFRICA (79%); CENTRAL EUROPE (73%); PORTUGAL (72%),"A survey of government accountability and openness in 25 countries around the globe has found that each one is challenged by corruption and lacks sufficient protections against electoral abuses, including developed democracies such as the United States, Germany and Japan. The year-long effort involved 150 journalists, social scientists and researchers on six continents under the supervision of a nonpartisan Washington-based group, the Center for Public Integrity. The resulting report, released yesterday, produced a ranking of nations in which none was labeled ""very strong"" on integrity of key institutions and accountability to the public. The United States was joined by Portugal, Australia, Italy, Germany and South Africa in receiving a ""strong"" rating, while seven countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa received ""moderate"" ratings. Russia joined Panama, Indonesia, Kenya and six other countries in being rated ""weak."" Guatemala and Zimbabwe fell below that level. ""This study shows that no country, regardless of wealth, size or population, is immune from corruption"" and its ensuing problems, said Charles Lewis, the center's executive director. He said the study was meant to illuminate the ""true extent and specific nature of abuses of power"" around the globe and to help the public press for reforms. In comparing nations on a rudimentary scale of anti-corruption mechanisms, the center joins a growing number of groups shining a spotlight on governance problems that have historically been given short shrift by U.S. and allied governments, as well as by the World Bank, the European Union and other major aid donors. Only in the  past decade has corruption been regarded by key international funders as a serious hindrance to development, and only in the  past two years -- under a controversial Bush administration foreign aid program known as the Millennium Challenge  Account -- has the United States emphasized good governance as a key condition for economic assistance. But donors' attitudes toward corruption are slowly being changed by the work of groups such as Transparency International, which annually surveys corruption in 34 countries with financial support from Britain, Germany, the United States and private foundations. ""Legal regimes governing political finance are generally inadequate"" everywhere, Transparency International said in its 2004 report, explaining that no regulations exist in one-third of the countries and that enforcement is weak in many others. It also cautioned that corruption has been pervasive in the former communist countries set this weekend to join the  EU, which lacks a comprehensive anti-corruption strategy. Similar warnings have been made by the American Bar Association, which recently prepared a judicial reform index and surveyed institutional shortcomings in 15 struggling Central European and Eurasian nations. According to the Center for Public Integrity's survey -- which Lewis called ""a work in progress"" that he wants to expand to 25 additional nations next year -- particular shortcomings exist in mechanisms to ensure that elections are free and fair, a key test of democracy. Turkey, for example, now trying to clear a series of hurdles so it can eventually join the  EU, lacks laws providing for public audits of political party finances and public access to reports about campaign financing and candidate assets. Turkey's head of state, and those in 13 other countries in the survey, cannot be prosecuted for corruption. Turkey also scored its ""weak"" ranking because journalists there have been harmed or imprisoned for investigating corruption, a circumstance it shared with 16 other nations, and because the ruling party controls two-thirds or more of the parliamentary seats -- a feature shared by five other countries. More-developed countries were not above reproach, however. Australia, Germany, India, Italy and Japan  were criticized because the top official in each of those countries -- as well as in Namibia and Zimbabwe -- is not legally obligated to disclose publicly all personal assets. Although the United States was rated strong or very strong in nearly every index measure, it was faulted in particular for lacking a national ombudsman -- along with four others of the 25 nations surveyed -- and for ineffective protections of government whistle-blowers. Lewis also sharply criticized the climate in Washington in which former officials and relatives of top officials in the Bush and Clinton administrations have profited from their access to decision makers. ""It's not Indonesia, Nigeria or Russia that boasts such an unabashed, mercenary culture in which influence peddlers so shamelessly cash in . . . but the United States,"" Lewis said. Private gain from public life, he noted, is both common and legal here."17-Nov-91,"UNITED STATES (97%); KENYA (95%); AFRICA (94%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (79%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%); NORDIC COUNTRIES (70%);","IN the 1980's Kenya was among a handful of African nations that could rely on large infusions of aid from Washington and the World Bank. Washington's interest in Kenya had a lot to do with its strategic position on the Indian Ocean, which made it a useful ally in the cold war. The World Bank's generosity was largely based on Kenya's capitalist outlook. In the last two years, American aid has dropped significantly, in part because the cold war evaporated and American aid budgets tightened in general, but also because of growing displeasure with President Daniel arap Moi's intransigence on the issues of democratization, human rights and corruption. Much of Africa is testing the possibilities of political pluralism now, but Mr. Moi continues to cling to a monopoly of power by squashing the opposition even as his regime is accused of corruption. Some diplomats have begun equating him with the despotic leader of Zaire, Mobutu Seso Seko -- a comparison that would have sounded implausible a few months ago. Some Western donors, especially the United States and the Scandinavian countries, believe that recent events in Kenya will test the World Bank's seriousness about its declaration that ""good governance"" is a requirement for receiving aid. In little more than a week, Kenya's donors will meet in Paris under the auspices of the World Bank to decide the size of Kenya's aid package next year. A Mysterious Death Last week, a retired Scotland Yard detective who had investigated the death of Robert Ouko, a former Foreign Minister, testified that corruption flourishes at the top of the Kenyan Government. The detective, John Troon, said he believed that Mr. Ouko was pushed into a car early one morning in February 1990, taken to the countryside near his house and shot because he was preparing a report on corrupt ministers in the Moi Government. At the same time as the extent of the corruption has become public, Mr. Moi has refused to recognize opposition groups, and he banned a rally scheduled for yesterday. A dozen well-known leaders of the opposition, which has been calling for a multiparty political system, were arrested and armed riot police used tear gas to disperse crowds attempting to get to the meeting place. Despite a major policy statement in 1989 that set ""good governance"" as a guiding rule for eligibility for aid in Africa, funding by the World Bank for Kenya has remained at high levels. In 1989, Kenya received nearly $1 billion from all Western donors, one-third of it from the World Bank and less than $100 million from the United States. By far the largest portion of bank aid went for financial support of the budget. Direct aid from the United States has fallen by half in the last two years, dropping from $80 million to $40 million. Economists say there are a number of reasons for the World Bank's leniency toward Kenya. First, the bank decided in the mid-1980's that more attention had to be given to Africa. The bank's vice president for Africa, Edward Jaycox, an American who has been fond of the continent ever since he took a postgraduate trip across Africa in the early 1960's, argued that Africa was a test case for development. Two former presidents of the bank, A. W. Clausen and Barber B. Conable Jr., went along with Mr. Jaycox's argument. During their tenures, the bank allocated substantially more money to the continent, shifting some long-term aid away from Asia in doing so. In the years 1982-86, yearly disbursements in grants and loans to Africa averaged $1.9 billion; between 1987 and 1991, the support increased to $3.3 billion. ""Up until now it has been difficult for the bank to put money in East Africa other than Kenya,"" says David Gordon, a former official of the United States Agency for International Development in Kenya. ""Uganda, Tanzania, Zimbabwe are all countries where five years ago it didn't make a lot of sense to put money."" Uganda was still torn by war, and Tanzania and Zimbabwe still practiced their various versions of socialism. By contrast, Kenya had capable technocrats and a capitalist orientation. So funds were pumped into Kenya even though corruption was getting worse, Mr. Gordon said. There is little doubt that the atmosphere at the Paris gathering will be grim. And the Kenyan delegation will be laboring under an added liability. The Vice President and Minister for Finance, George Saitoti, who will head the team, was named at the inquiry into Mr. Ouko's death as one of the ministers who demanded a kickback from a company planning to rehabilitate an industrial project. Mr. Saitoti also offered what diplomats considered an unbelievable explanation last week of why the foreign exchange held by Kenyans overseas had soared tenfold from $200 million in 1982 to $2.6 billion this year. The United States Agency for International Development said the capital flight was due to ""investor uncertainty and rampant corruption."" Mr. Saitoti attributed the extraordinary size of the foreign holdings to undispersed money from foreign donors, a statement that could not be squared with the facts, diplomats said. In advance of the Paris meeting, members of the opposition appealed to the donors to get tough. Until there is political reform in Kenya, they argued, economic aid will be counterproductive. ""The current trends in our country show the limits of reforming economic policy in a deformed political environment,"" they said in an open letter. Two days after the letter was made public, three of the signers, including Gitobu Imanyara, the editor of The Nairobi Law Monthly, were arrested."21-Oct-91,"UNITED STATES (97%); KENYA (95%); DENMARK (94%); UNITED KINGDOM (93%); ETHIOPIA (79%); AFRICA (79%); SOMALIA (79%); UGANDA (79%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (79%); SUDAN (79%);","Corruption among top Kenyan Government officials has become so pervasive that Western donors, no longer confident that their assistance is reaching the people it is intended for, are cutting their aid programs, Western diplomats and economists say. Further, corruption is a deterrent to new investment in Kenya, economists and foreign officials say, and a Bush Administration official says the American Embassy here has told Washington in a report that it believes that President Daniel arap Moi and some of his top aides and relatives are the main offenders. The problem of corruption in third-world nations is not a new one. But Kenya, with its capitalist economic practices and relatively efficient infrastructure, was long regarded by Western donors as a success story amid the economic rubble of Africa. The country has been rewarded with large increases in Western aid, both from the World Bank and individual donors. Denmark Halting New Aid But now that story has changed, as shown by these developments: *The Danish Government, until recently one of the biggest donors to Kenya, said Friday that it was immediately ending its 17-year support for rural development in Kenya after an audit showed that most of the nearly $40 million in that aid program ""disappeared because of corruption."" Last month, the Danes said they were freezing all new aid to Kenya. *The British Government, the former colonial power, decided this year not to give Kenya money to subsidize oil prices for consumers, a European diplomat said, because British officials feared that the money would go to a powerful politician instead. *For similar reasons, two Western diplomats said, the World Bank decided against an ambitious $100 million program with the Moi Government to promote the domestic energy production. *The American and British embassies had to intervene to keep Citibank from leaving Kenya after a dispute with a Cabinet minister over repayment of loans, Western diplomats said. 'A Deleterious Effect' ""I don't know if Kenya is at the head of the class when it comes to corruption but they're a contender,"" the United States Ambassador, Smith Hempstone, said recently. ""The state of the economy is extremely fragile, and corruption has a deleterious effect."" The first President of independent Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta, and his family amassed a large fortune in land, precious gems, ivory and casinos during his rule from 1963 to 1978. But economists here say the Kenyatta dealings were small compared with the systematic hold that Mr. Moi and some colleagues have acquired over the larger Kenyan economy of the 1980's and 1990's. Even so, Kenya, which gained independence from Britain in 1963, has appeared attractive to Western aid donors because of its remarkably strong economy, especially as seen next to those of its war-torn neighbors, Somalia, Ethiopia, the Sudan, and Uganda and impoverished Tanzania. Thus, foreign aid jumped from $200 million in 1986 to $1 billion in 1989. But a Western diplomat said that when Western donors meet in Paris next month to decide Kenya's aid for next year, they are likely to give Kenya less than it requested, in large part because of the corruption. The practice of politicians demanding a share of a business is a deterrent to the new large-scale investment that Kenya needs to deal with its accelerating unemployment, a Western economist here said. A Western donor country's assessment said that private investment in Kenya fell by 12 percent last year. It was the first overall decline since 1982, when there was an attempted coup, the assessment said, although American officials noted that American private investment has been dwindling for the last decade. In response to the pressure from aid donors, the Kenyan Government has announced that it is establishing an anticorruption unit to ferret out bribe takers. In a speech on Oct. 10, celebrating his 13th year in power, President Moi made special note of corruption. ""My Government is already aware of this problem and is taking appropriate measures to deal with it,"" he said in the speech at a crowded stadium here. Last year, a Bush Administration official said, the American Embassy here reported to Washington in a cable that a ""get rich now"" philosophy pervaded the top echelon of Mr. Moi's Government. The official said the embassy wrote that it was almost impossible to document the wealth of Kenyan officials. But the Embassy reported in another cable that the British High Commission estimated the wealth of Energy Minister Nicholas Biwott to be ""hundreds of millions of dollars,"" chiefly in offshore holdings. As Cabinet Minister in charge of energy, Mr. Biwott's official monthly salary is 21,033 Kenyan shillings, about $750. A member of the Kalenjin tribe, to which President Moi also belongs, Mr. Biwott is considered to be President Moi's closest political confidant. The Administration official said the embassy had reported in the ""get-rich-now"" cable that officials believed that four Kenyan Government officials and three relatives of Mr. Moi had greatly enriched themselves through their public office or access to officials. The embassy listed the officials as Mr. Moi; Mr. Biwott; Vice President George Saitoti, and the Permanent Secretary in the President's Office for Internal Security, Hezekiah Oyugi. Efforts to interview Mr. Moi and Mr. Oyugi were unsuccessful. Mr. Biwott said by telephone that he would consider an interview, and when asked about being described by a Western embassy as having enriched himself through public office, he said: ""I'm not aware of such cables. If you have any I will answer accordingly."" An Assistant Minister, John Keen, who works in the Office of the President, said in an interview that he could not comment on the specific names mentioned in the cable to Washington. Mr. Keen, who has been criticizing recent anti-Western comments by Mr. Biwott and other Government officials, said he believed all Kenyan public officials and their wives should be made to declare their assets. He described the recent announcement to set up an anticorruption unit as falling ""far below expectations."" ""Either the cancer of corruption is killed or it will kill the state,"" Mr. Keen said. The American Embassy here, describing what it called an example of personal financial gain through public office, reported that Mr. Moi was believed to be a partner in an oil refinery in Puerto Rico with an Israeli businessman. The embassy said two Kenyan businessmen were believed to operate as front men for the President and ""cut"" the President in on their deals. The embassy said Mr. Moi, who comes from a humble background and was a teacher before entering politics, is believed to have a share in a Nairobi casino and a hotel in the Masai Mara game park. The embassy also said it was believed that Mr. Moi had received a ""seven-figure"" commission when Kenya bought two airplanes from the European consortium Airbus Industrie in the late 1980s. It is not illegal for public officials in Kenya to engage in private business. Western diplomats in Nairobi as well as local businessmen said it was common for a handful of senior politicians to demand a share in the start-up of a company or to demand control once a company became successful. ""If you come into Kenya and make a lot of money you are a target,"" a Western diplomat said. Britain Denies Fuel Grants As Energy Minister, Mr. Biwott is in charge of a large section of the Kenyan economy, ranging from the oil industry, hydroelectricity, coastal development, pipeline construction and one of the largest government enterprises, Kenya Power and Lighting. Through this commanding position, Western diplomats and economists said, Mr. Biwott has been able to amass a large private fortune. In response to a request for an interview, Mr. Biwott said he would grant an interview after a public inquiry into the killing of former Foreign Minister Robert Ouko, who was slain in February 1990. Government corruption has become an issue in the already lengthy Ouko inquiry, which lawyers here said they believed could last another six months. At the height of the Persian Gulf crisis, when gas prices rose, the British Government decided not to grant about $7 million to Kenya for subsidizing consumer fuel costs. The British made similar grants in neighboring Uganda and Tanzania, but a European diplomat said the British felt that such a grant in Kenya would be siphoned off by the interests of Mr. Biwott. Two Western diplomats said the World Bank had proposed spending about $100 million for domestic energy production, but could not get a commitment from Mr. Biwott that the program would be properly audited and thus canceled the plans. In what Western diplomats described as the most disturbing intrusion into the private sector by a politician that they could explicitly document, companies belonging to Mr. Biwott brought legal action in June against the Nairobi branch of Citibank. Both the American and British embassies had to intervene to keep Citibank from leaving Kenya, the diplomats said. The trouble arose when Citibank sought to collect on $14 million in loans to some of Mr. Biwott's companies.  Western diplomats said Mr. Biwott's lawyers went to Kenya's High Court and got an injunction that blocked the bank from collecting on the loans, of which $11.2 million worth was secured by letters of credit in a Swiss bank account of Mr. Biwott. Threat From Foreign Banks An American diplomat said a senior official in the embassy complained about Mr. Biwott's actions to the Vice President, Mr. Saitoti, saying Citibank and other foreign banks would leave Kenya if Mr. Biwott was able to avoid payment in this fashion. Western diplomats said a senior British diplomat conveyed a similar message to the Chief Judge of the High Court, Alan Hancox. Mr. Biwott held larger loans with the Nairobi branch of the British bank, Barclays, the diplomats said. The injunction was then lifted at a court hearing before the judge who had granted it."5-Nov-06,UNITED STATES (98%); KAZAKHSTAN (95%); NIGERIA (93%); ASIA (92%); GUATEMALA (92%); PAKISTAN (79%); CENTRAL ASIA (79%); SOUTHERN ASIA (74%),"ON a warm afternoon in late September, Nursultan A. Nazarbayev strode across the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base to board his private 767. Surrounded by an entourage of security guards and political advisers, Mr. Nazarbayev, the president of Kazakhstan, was heading home after an eventful visit that included a meeting with President Bush in the White House and a boating jaunt in Maine with the president's father, George H. W. Bush. He also attended a swank fete at the Capital Hilton Hotel where his hosts, the business mogul Ted Turner and former Senator Sam Nunn, praised him for closing a major nuclear test site. Warm welcomes aside, human rights groups frequently characterize Mr. Nazarbayev as a dictator who, during 15 years of rule, established a hammerlock on his country's oil riches and amassed a fortune at the expense of an impoverished citizenry. Supporters say he has wedded a draconian political order to clear-eyed economic policies, making his country hospitable to foreign investment. But his White House visit came at a tender moment. About a month earlier, the Bush administration introduced its National Strategy to Internationalize Efforts Against Kleptocracy, an initiative aimed at preventing public graft worldwide by, among other things, denying corrupt leaders access to the United States financial system. ''Kleptocracy is an obstacle to democratic progress, undermines faith in government institutions and steals prosperity from the people,'' President Bush said. ''Promoting transparent, accountable governance is a critical component of our freedom agenda.'' Mr. Nazarbayev's visit, coming on the heels of those sentiments, sparked renewed criticism of his leadership and questions about the White House's dedication to battling corruption overseas -- possibly explaining why the administration decided against holding a state dinner in the Kazakh leader's honor. But behind the scenes, a legal drama has been playing out that analysts say may more fully explain why Mr. Nazarbayev and the White House are engaged in such an elaborate form of political kabuki. In February, the United States attorney's office in Manhattan is scheduled to go to trial in the largest foreign bribery case brought against an American citizen. It involves a labyrinthine trail of international financial transfers, suspected money laundering and a dizzying array of domestic and overseas shell corporations. The criminal case names Mr. Nazarbayev as an unindicted co-conspirator. The defendant, James H. Giffen, a wealthy American merchant banker and a consultant to the Kazakh government, is accused of channeling more than $78 million in bribes to Mr. Nazarbayev and the head of the country's oil ministry. The money, doled out by American companies seeking access to Kazakhstan's vast oil reserves, went toward the Kazakh leadership's personal use, including the purchase of expensive jewelry, speedboats, snowmobiles and fur coats, federal prosecutors say. Beyond the large amounts of cash involved and the top-flight access such sums often secure, the case against Mr. Giffen has opened a window onto the high-stakes, transcontinental maneuvering that occurs when Big Oil and political access overlap -- a juncture marked by intense and expensive lobbying, overseas deal-making and the intersection of money, business and geopolitics. It is a shadow world of nebulous boundaries that people like Mr. Giffen establish and define, often on the fly. The case also illustrates the government's struggle to reconcile its short-term energy interests with its longer-term political goal of encouraging democracy in countries the international community has deemed corrupt. To be sure, many an American president has entertained a foreign leader under a cloud of suspicion, but Mr. Nazarbayev's role in a federal criminal investigation makes him an unusual entry into that company. Bush administration officials have acknowledged that the Kazakh government falls short in its democracy-building efforts. But some foreign policy specialists see Kazakhstan as an important ally in the administration's campaign against terrorism and a bountiful alternative to oil reserves in the volatile Persian Gulf -- all of which promise to make the opening of the Giffen trial more than just hit-and-run bribery fare. ''The administration is naturally reticent about Giffen's case,'' said Raymond W. Baker, an energy policy analyst on loan to the Brookings Institution, a liberal research group. ''It would probably be a lot easier on everyone if he had gotten away with it.'' IN a world long accustomed to outsize public corruption, some analysts say Mr. Nazarbayev is in a class by himself. ''I can't think of a leader in the free world as notoriously corrupt as Nazarbayev,'' said Jonathan Winer, a former deputy assistant secretary of state during the Clinton administration. ''We've known about his corruption for at least 15 years because our own intelligence agencies have told us.'' Mr. Nazarbayev is certainly a mixed bag of goods, others said, but that is the way the world works. As Jerry Taylor, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian research group, put it, ''Kazakhstan's human rights record may be checkered, but if the United States were to disengage from those countries with checkered human rights and other bad actors, we'd be history.'' The Clinton administration itself embraced Kazakhstan in the 1990s and praised Mr. Nazarbayev for leading his country toward economic and democratic reform. Administration officials, including the former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, also met with Mr. Nazarbayev in Kazakhstan. ''The Clinton administration certainly had enough information about Nazarbayev's corruption,'' Mr. Winer said. ''The information on him was open, notorious and present.'' The work of defending the curious financial and diplomatic portfolio of Mr. Giffen is the job of William J. Schwartz and Steven M. Cohen, of Cooley Godward Kronish in Manhattan. The firm's 48th-floor conference room offers some of the standard accoutrements of the white-collar defense bar -- handsome wood paneling, a flat-screen television, a skyline view facing south toward Wall Street and a long oval table surrounded by leather chairs and punctuated at its center by a bouquet of sharpened white pencils. In the spring of 2003, federal agents arrested Mr. Giffen as he and Mr. Schwartz prepared to board a flight from New York to Paris. Prosecutors accused him of overseeing a tangled bribery network in the 1990s designed to buy access and influence in Kazakhstan for oil giants like Exxon Mobil, BP Amoco (now BP) and Phillips Petroleum (now ConocoPhillips). The payments, prosecutors said, violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which forbids American citizens or corporations from paying bribes to foreign officials to obtain business. None of the oil companies have been accused of any wrongdoing. While Mr. Giffen's lawyers have conceded that their client shuffled money from one secret bank account to another, they have maintained that he did not act alone. ''Mr. Giffen was working with the knowledge of our government,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''Jim's access in Kazakhstan was a function of a bizarre historical time.'' At the heart of Mr. Giffen's defense is a motion filed by his lawyers in June 2004 to Judge William H. Pauley III of Federal District Court in Manhattan, seeking access to classified government documents for his defense. For now, each of the names, titles, and government affiliations of individuals mentioned in the document are blacked out on virtually every page. Mr. Giffen's lawyers have argued that much of the evidence necessary to prove his innocence rests with various officials and agencies that helped him conduct business in Kazakhstan. Without such witnesses, the lawyers say, it will be difficult for them to prove their client was performing his duties as an American. Court filings by Mr. Giffen's lawyers suggest that senior officials at the Central Intelligence Agency, State Department and White House encouraged him to use his close ties with Kazakh leaders to ferry valuable intelligence back to the United States. Judge Pauley has written an opinion supporting the motion, but the United States attorney's office has appealed it. ''Before this is over, Giffen's lawyers will file a variety of motions to get at the classified stuff, but the history of that isn't terribly terrific,'' said Jack Blum, a former investigator for the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee. ''Senior officials can very conveniently avoid governmental embarrassment by keeping everything classified.'' Mr. Blum added, ''When you have a kind of blink-and-nod, clandestine waiver of the law with the government, once the problem blows up, you're going to get hung out to dry.'' Spokeswomen from the C.I.A. and the White House declined to comment. Congress passed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in 1977 after concluding that bribery abroad had become an important foreign policy issue that ''embarrasses friendly governments, causes a decline in foreign esteem for the United States and casts suspicion on the activities of our enterprises, giving credence to our foreign opponents.'' Mr. Giffen's lawyers say he cannot be found guilty of bribing a foreign government because his activities were part of his official duties as an adviser to the Kazakh government and they received the blessing of senior American officials who regularly debriefed him on his activities. That contention has prompted a blizzard of motions, memorandums and filings between the federal government and Mr. Giffen's lawyers. Federal prosecutors have sought to block Mr. Giffen's access to documents on the grounds that disclosing them could breach national security interests. It was not only individuals in Kazakhstan who received some of their client's bounteous fees, former associates of Mr. Giffen said. In 1998, two years before federal investigators began looking into Mr. Giffen's activities in Kazakhstan, he invited Mark Siegel, a Washington political consultant, to join a group of policy experts to develop a blueprint for reforming Kazakhstan's economy and government. It was an ambitious task, Mr. Giffen conceded, but its participants would be well compensated. Mr. Siegel, a former executive director of the Democratic National Committee, agreed to a monthly retainer of $30,000 for his firm and soon found himself on a flight to Almaty, Kazakhstan's former capital. As it turned out, Mr. Siegel was in high-powered company. Mr. Giffen had harnessed prominent businessmen, policy experts, lobbyists and former government officials to serve on the committee. Among those included in the group were Robert Blackwill, a former ambassador during the first Bush presidency, and Philip D. Zelikow, now a counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Siegel recalled in an interview. Neither Mr. Blackwill nor Mr. Zelikow responded to interview requests. ''We were a kind of a Great White Hope,'' Mr. Siegel said. The committee was divided into a ''P Group'' and an ''E Group'' to distinguish political and economic experts in the group. Mr. Nazarbayev ''came across as a reformer open to free markets and fair elections.'' According to his lawyers, Mr. Giffen, at Mr. Nazarbayev's direction, paid several million dollars in fees from Swiss accounts -- many of the same accounts named in Mr. Giffen's indictment -- to committee members for their expertise on a range of policy issues involving Kazakhstan. The group's recommendations can be found in two spiral-bound documents that came to be known simply as the Red Books. Mr. Giffen's lawyers, as well as Mr. Siegel, said the creation of the committee reflected Mr. Giffen's interest in helping Mr. Nazarbayev move his country away from an authoritarian government to a more democratic model. While the Red Books lists an impressive array of financiers and policy makers in its membership ranks, some of those named in the document said they never worked with Mr. Giffen. One of those people, John C. Whitehead, the former chairman of the investment banking giant Goldman Sachs, acknowledged being an acquaintance of Mr. Giffen but said he was never part of the group. ''I've never been to Kazakhstan,'' Mr. Whitehead said, ''and I've certainly not had that kind of formal relationship with Jim Giffen.'' Mr. Giffen's lawyers declined to discuss any other aspects of his work with the committee, but said that the committee's existence proved that the scope of his influence with policy makers far transcended energy matters. SUPPORTED or not by the federal government, Mr. Giffen reportedly managed to orchestrate what the government describes in its indictment as an elaborate money laundering and tax fraud scheme carried out in six separate oil transactions from 1995 to 1999, all of which involved defrauding the government of Kazakhstan. Mr. Giffen is accused of hiding some of the proceeds in each of the deals through a series of wire transfers that ultimately landed in Swiss bank accounts. One deal Mr. Giffen's indictment details involved Mobil Oil's 1996 purchase of a 25 percent interest in Kazakhstan's Tengiz oil field. Located in the mineral-rich Caspian region, Tengiz is the sixth-largest oil field in the world, producing 285,000 barrels a day, or about a third of the country's daily production. The indictment states that after Mobil paid Mr. Giffen a $51 million fee for negotiating the deal, he transferred half of the money to a Swiss account and then sent the money on a circuitous path through a number of other accounts, including one registered to a British Virgin Islands company. Exxon and Mobil merged in late 1999 to form Exxon Mobil, the world's largest oil company. Russ Roberts, an Exxon spokesman, said Mobil was not the source of any payments to Mr. Giffen. ''Exxon Mobil has no knowledge of any illegal payments made to Kazakh officials by any current or former Mobil employees,'' Mr. Roberts wrote in an e-mail response to an interview request. ''We also have no knowledge of any illegal payments received by any current or former Mobil employees.'' Mr. Roberts said neither Mr. Giffen nor his company, Mercator, had represented Mobil or Exxon Mobil. In 2003, a former Mobil manager pleaded guilty to evading taxes on $7 million he received from Mr. Giffen starting in 1993. Mr. Roberts noted that Mr. Giffen's payments to the manager had begun several years before any Mobil acquisition in Kazakhstan and that Mobil had not been the source of the payments. Although prosecutors described the payments to the manager as ''kickbacks'' for work done on Mobil's behalf, the manager, Mr. Roberts said, repudiated that accusation. Mr. Roberts declined to further discuss the matter. But according to the indictment, Mr. Giffen wired another chunk of what court papers describe as a Mobil fee, about $20 million, into another pair of Swiss accounts. Nurlan Balgimbaev, the former prime minister and oil minister of Kazakhstan, controlled one of the accounts, according to the indictment. A Liechtenstein trust, of which Mr. Nazarbayev and his family were beneficiaries, controlled the other account, the indictment asserts. In the process, the government asserts, Mr. Giffen paid $36,000 of Mr. Balgimbaev's personal bills for the upkeep of a house in Newtown, Mass., spent $30,000 to buy fur coats for Mr. Nazarbayev's wife and daughter and bought a Donzi speedboat as a gift from Mr. Nazarbayev to Mr. Balgimbaev. ConocoPhillips and BP, two of the other oil companies which the indictment says paid Mr. Giffen, declined to comment. A lawyer and former federal prosecutor who represents the Republic of Kazakhstan, Reid H. Weingarten, declined to discuss the case. But few involved on either side of Mr. Giffen's case have denied that his ties to Mr. Nazarbayev were substantial, longstanding and gilded. ''Everyone agrees on one thing, which is that Nazarbayev took bribes,'' said Rinat Akhmetshin, director of the International Eurasian Institute, a Washington research group that supports Mr. Nazarbayev's political opponents. Mr. Akhmetshin said the case was being closely followed in Kazakhstan and that Mr. Nazarbayev's political future could turn on the trial's outcome. ''The moment Giffen goes to jail, Nazarbayev is finished as a politician,'' he said. JAMES GIFFEN'S financial ascent -- from a young banker on the make into a well-heeled political insider with a bodyguard, a chauffeur-driven Mercedes-Benz and a Kazakh diplomatic passport -- was a serendipitous blend of lucrative financial opportunities in Eastern Europe and Central Asia and old-fashioned elbow grease. The son of a clothier in Stockton, Calif., Mr. Giffen, who is now 65, had ties to the Soviet Union dating back to the early 1970s. After graduating from the University of California, Berkeley and the School of Law at U.C.L.A., he started his career at a minerals trading firm before joining a subsidiary of the Armco Steel Corporation (later acquired by AK Steel). Armco was led by C. William Verity Jr., a champion of increased trade with the Soviet Union who would later serve as commerce secretary in the Reagan administration. Mr. Giffen became a vice president at the Armco subsidiary, which sold drilling equipment to the Soviet Union. Although Mr. Giffen did not speak Russian, and the Soviets showed little interest at the time in trading with the West, he persistently courted Russia's leaders. Nattily dressed and with a cigarette constantly in hand, Mr. Giffen exuded an affecting bluster and self-assurance -- many who know him call it bravado -- that eventually gained him the ears of high-ranking Soviet leaders. By the mid-1980s, Mr. Giffen had left Armco and founded his own company, Mercator, a boutique merchant bank headquartered in New York. He began the company with a five-year contract from Armco and a board of directors that included Mr. Verity and two former government officials. Over the next decade, his lawyers have said, Mr. Giffen came to count Mikhail Gorbachev in his network of powerful friends within the Soviet government, the Communist Party and the K.G.B. In the late 1980s, Mr. Giffen convinced Chevron, Eastman Kodak, Ford Motor and RJR Nabisco to form a coalition aimed at penetrating the Soviet market through joint ventures -- deals that Mercator would handle. Although that initiative collapsed with the Soviet Union in 1991, Mr. Giffen had apparently become a conduit for information involving United States-Soviet affairs. On one occasion, the White House asked him to describe a meeting he had had with Mr. Gorbachev and to suggest trade issues that the first President Bush should raise with Mr. Gorbachev, according to filings in the federal court case. A memo, which an American official apparently prepared for the first President Bush, recounts Mr. Giffen as stating the president had ''hit paydirt'' with Mr. Gorbachev and that ''whatever President Bush wants to do, Gorbachev will try to do.'' When 15 independent states emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union, Mr. Nazarbayev contacted Mr. Giffen, his lawyers say. Mr. Nazarbayev, head of Kazakhstan's Communist Party, and Mr. Giffen, who was president of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council, had become close friends by that time, said Mr. Schwartz, the lawyer. DURING Chevron's discussions to acquire an interest in the Tengiz oil field, the company became one of Mr. Giffen's clients. The company says the relationship was short-lived. ''In the early 1990s, Chevron obtained the services of Mr. Giffen with respect to business opportunities with Russia and the individual republics,'' the company said in an e-mail response to an interview request. ''Chevron terminated that relationship in 1992.'' Mr. Nazarbayev asked Mr. Giffen to play an advisory role within the newly sovereign nation of Kazakhstan, according to Mr. Giffen's lawyers. As the country's first president, Mr. Nazarbayev was determined to attract the involvement of multinational oil companies in developing his country's bountiful oil fields, according to political and economic analysts. To that end, Mr. Nazarbayev hired Mr. Giffen to serve dual roles. As a special adviser to Kazakhstan, Mr. Giffen oversaw the country's efforts to attract investment from the United States, while his company, Mercator, advised the Kazakh government on oil and gas transactions. ''Giffen was able to cast himself as a bigger-than-life figure who really knew how to work the West,'' said Martha Brill Olcott, a specialist on Central Asian and Caspian affairs with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''Nazarbayev liked that and they created a relationship of great personal trust.'' Mr. Giffen's and Mr. Nazarbayev's close relationship sparked resentment among some senior Kazakh officials. ''The biggest problem with Giffen was that he was trying to create an instrument of government that would keep himself and the president in power,'' said the former prime minister of Kazakhstan, Akezhan Kazhegeldin. ''He never dreamed he'd be so close to power.'' In a telephone interview, Mr. Kazhegeldin declined to discuss Mr. Giffen's indictment but said that he and Mr. Giffen had clashed on several occasions. Within Kazakhstan's senior ranks, Mr. Kazhegeldin had gained a reputation as a champion of free enterprise economics and someone favored among Western leaders, Ms. Olcott said. Mr. Kazhegeldin himself asserted that his penchant for economic reform and his calls to reform his country's autocratic government ultimately alienated both Mr. Giffen and Mr. Nazarbayev. Now living in Italy and London, Mr. Kazhegeldin said he had spent millions of dollars on lobbyists and public affairs specialists in the hope of defeating Mr. Nazarbayev in Kazakhstan's next election, scheduled for 2011. ''There is a small group of people getting rich -- and I mean really rich -- in Kazakhstan while the rest of society remains really poor,'' Mr. Kazhegeldin said. ''The leadership is not interested in pushing a market economy. They keep two sets of books, one for themselves and another for everyone else.'' Mr. Kazhegeldin, however, is a veteran of the pell-mell economic scramble of the post-Soviet years. He amassed his wealth as a rogue salesman in the waning years before the Soviet Union's dissolution, selling scrap metal on the black market while studying international business at Moscow's K.G.B. Academy, according to a resume furnished by a close associate who asked not to be identified because of the nature of the work he does for Mr. Kazhegeldin. After the spy school kicked him out in 1989 for his moonlighting activities, Mr. Kazhegeldin went on to make his millions exporting chemical fertilizer, the associate said. Mr. Nazarbayev began his own investigation of Mr. Kazhegeldin's finances in the fall of 1998 -- to score political points, Mr. Kazhegeldin's supporters said -- which snowballed into an international scandal when it led the United States government to examine Mr. Giffen's activities more closely. In fall 1999, the Kazakh government accused Mr. Kazhegeldin of embezzling several million dollars into an offshore account that he controlled. Mr. Kazhegeldin denied any wrongdoing and said neither he nor any family members had access to the account. Mr. Kazhegeldin accused Mr. Nazarbayev of arranging the deposit and leaking information about it to the news media to secure victory in a 1999 presidential election. A 1999 State Department examination of the Kazakh investigation into the accounts reportedly linked to Mr. Kazhegeldin concluded that the investigation, ''while possibly grounded in facts, appeared motivated politically.'' After Kazakh officials contacted Belgian and Swiss authorities to examine Mr. Kazhegeldin's possible role in the looting of government funds, the Swiss contacted the Justice Department to discuss what appeared to be a pattern of questionable transactions between Kazakhstan and American and European oil companies. As federal investigators reviewed the transactions in 2000, they noticed that Mr. Giffen was party to many of them, according to his lawyers. Over the next two years, investigators focused more closely on Mr. Giffen and subpoenaed records from Mercator. A treaty between the United States and Switzerland permitted investigators to obtain detailed records of Mr. Giffen's financial activities in New York and Switzerland, according to his lawyers. In February 2003, the United States attorney's office in Manhattan won a grand jury indictment against Mr. Giffen on fraud charge. A month later, as Mr. Giffen boarded a flight from New York to Paris with his lawyers, federal authorities arrested him. As the Giffen trial moves forward, with the possibility that more information about Mr. Giffen's interactions with the Kazakh government, Washington policy makers and multinational corporations may emerge, it promises to shine a spotlight on the terms of engagement when the United States courts resource-rich countries riddled with corruption. ''Corruption is at the heart of what causes poverty in third world countries,'' said Mr. Blum, the former Congressional investigator. ''We tell ourselves that in the short term, we can buy these guys who will serve the national interest, but in the long run it always turns into a disaster.'' The World Bank, the Washington economic development organization that focuses its efforts on needy countries, has brought much of the current debate about overseas financial corruption to the fore. In the early 1990s, the bank started measuring corruption within the governments of its member countries. The initiative was controversial because until then, economists had largely considered corruption to be an ethical or cultural issue. The bank began interviewing hundreds of private citizens, as well as employees in government and business, trying to pin down the pattern and prevalence of corruption in areas like banking, real estate, health care, media and education. ''What we realized was that corruption is not just a moral or ethical issue but an economic development issue,'' said Daniel Kaufmann, an economist who began the World Bank's corruption studies. ''We estimated that with good governance, there is a threefold increase in per capita income as funds that should be allocated toward the gross domestic product are not siphoned off.'' BY 1995, Mr. Kaufmann's team developed a rating system that measured factors like corruption control, absence of violence, government accountability and regulatory quality in various countries. The ideas became a cornerstone of the bank's agenda. Since the mid-1990s, it has started more than 600 anticorruption programs in nearly 100 countries. Under Paul D. Wolfowitz, who became head of the World Bank last year, it has continued its anticorruption efforts. In what Mr. Wolfowitz described as efforts to stem corruption, he recently threatened to cut loans and development contracts in India and Kenya. Mr. Wolfowitz, a former deputy defense secretary in the Bush administration and an architect of its policies in the Middle East, has received the White House's backing in prioritizing anticorruption campaigns. But some research groups, and some of the bank's own administrators, have criticized Mr. Wolfowitz for using the World Bank to advance the White House's foreign policy goals in countries like Iraq, where the bank recently increased its lending support. A World Bank spokesman denied that Mr. Wolfowitz was serving the White House's interests. ''He doesn't hesitate to serve as an independent voice for the poorest people -- including when it goes against the grain on issues like trade, debt relief and support for official development assistance,'' the spokesman wrote in an e-mail message. Kazakhstan, and Mr. Nazarbayev's stewardship of the country, have been fodder for World Bank scrutiny. According to the bank's 2005 Worldwide Governance Indicators, Kazakhstan ranks with Angola, Bolivia, Kenya, Libya and Pakistan among the world's corruption hotspots. Other anticorruption watchdogs, like Transparency International, also rate Kazakhstan poorly for its governance practices. The State Department's 2005 Kazakhstan Country Report on Human Rights Practices noted that the Kazakhstan government's ''human rights record remained poor'' and that ''corruption remained a serious problem.'' Despite such low scores and scathing critiques, the World Bank has lent Kazakhstan more than $2 billion for 28 projects since 1992. In fiscal 2006, commitments to Kazakhstan totaled $130 million, with overall commitments for active projects at $648 million. Juan Jose Daboub, who oversees the World Bank's governance program, declined to comment specifically on corruption issues in Kazakhstan or on Mr. Nazarbayev's leadership. ''We respect what countries pick in terms of leadership,'' said Mr. Daboub. ''We are not judges, prosecutors or investigators.'' But Mr. Baker, the energy analyst at the Brookings Institution, saw things differently: ''If you're a country with a lot of oil, you get a lot of free passes.'' Human rights groups have spent years blasting Mr. Nazarbayev for shutting newspapers critical of his regime; passing laws that threatened to prosecute individuals whose actions were considered threats to the country's economic development efforts; tolerating and participating in vast graft; and the like. But rarely have American policy makers openly opposed Mr. Nazarbayev's leadership and actions, analysts said. ''He has done a pretty sophisticated job of reaching out to many sectors,'' said Thomas O. Melia, deputy director of Freedom House, a liberal research group in Washington. ''He is not like a lot of leaders, who put all of their eggs in the White House basket.'' Even so, the White House, through successive administrations, has been a reliable and enormously influential ally of Mr. Nazarbayev, and its continued embrace of Kazakhstan's leader rankles some members of Congress. ''It's just hypocritical for President Bush to issue statements on combating foreign corruption and then to embrace a dictator,'' said Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. ''It sends a real negative message to countries that you're trying to win support from.'' Senator Levin characterized Mr. Nazarbayev as ''an iron-fisted dictator who imprisons his opponents, bans opposition parties and controls the press.'' But some say the White House should be worldly wise when it comes to supporting certain countries in volatile but resource-rich regions. Ariel Cohen, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, said the Bush administration had effectively balanced its long-term foreign policy goals involving energy issues with its human rights standards in Central Asia. Because of turmoil in other Central Asian countries, Kazakhstan has emerged as a possible military foothold for the United States there. ''When it comes to Kazakhstan, it's all about three things; energy, democracy and security,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''I would argue that relative to his competition in Central Asia, Nazarbayev is the most successful in pursuing each of them. Sure, there is still corruption and insufficient rule of law, but this is a country that 15 years ago had no statehood. They have started from scratch.'' If Mr. Giffen's trial gets under way in February, it may enrich and shed light on the debate about the United States' engagement with Kazakhstan and other countries that have poor anticorruption records. FOR their part, Kazakh officials worry that Mr. Giffen's trial may set their nation on a backward course. Mr. Weingarten, the lawyer representing the Kazakh government, wrote a letter in 2002 to the Justice Department on behalf of his client. The letter was straightforward: ''Even if it were possible for the prosecutors to indict President Nazarbayev, we cannot envision a scenario where the United States would deem it in its interest to indict the leader of an important strategic ally.'' Even more important, said some of Mr. Giffen's allies, is that the whole messy affair of moving bribes and laundered money around the world has caused Mr. Giffen's work to become unfairly mischaracterized. ''If this whole thing was just about oil, it was one of the biggest snow jobs in U.S. history,'' said Mr. Siegel, the Washington lobbyist who aided Mr. Giffen's efforts in Kazakhstan. ''I believed that we were doing God's work.''

Together, the nearly 500 documents and thousands of pages constitute a trove of U.N. secrets stretching back over five years, including allegations of bribes paid for tsunami relief projects in Indonesia, of sexual harassment in Gaza and a revelation that a U.N. anti-drug official ran a presidential campaign while receiving a U.N. paycheck. The pages also document a spree of alleged criminal activities, including a bribery scheme at the airport in Pristina, Kosovo, gold trading by U.N. peacekeepers in Congo, and the theft and resale of food rations by Ukrainian pilots serving the United Nations in Liberia. Mark D.  Wallace, the U.S.  representative for U.N. management and reform, has posted 477 documents, following the lead of his former boss, John R. Bolton, who as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations began releasing documents as early as 2006. ""I didn't see any reason why U.N. audit documents shouldn't be made public,"" recalled Bolton, comparing the situation  to the Government Accountability Office's publication of reports on U.S. government activities. ""I didn't think my job was to cover up for the United Nations."" Most of the names of those targeted in the reports have been redacted by the United Nations, but the identities are easily deciphered. The documents' disclosure has shed light on some major U.N. mysteries, including the abrupt retirement of Jacques Paul Klein, a former American diplomat who served as the U.N. special representative in Liberia until April 2005. A two-page document labeled ""strictly confidential"" accuses Klein of an improper relationship with a local woman suspected of passing on secrets to Charles Taylor, the former Liberian president now on trial for war crimes. Klein was one of the most visible U.S. nationals at the United Nations, where he served as special representative in Eastern Slavonia in 1996, and later as the U.N.'s high representative in Bosnia. In 2003, Klein was chosen to lead the U.N. mission in Liberia (UNMIL), the organization's largest peacekeeping operation at the time, where he oversaw the transition from Charles Taylor's rule to the election of President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, a former World Bank economist. Klein developed a reputation for bullying Bosnian or Liberian power brokers into yielding to U.N. demands, and he presided over missions in Bosnia and Liberia that faced sexual misconduct scandals involving U.N. personnel. Klein met Linda Fawaz, a 30-year-old Liberian American woman whose uncle headed a major timber company. According to the report, Fawaz (identified as ""Local Woman"") accompanied Klein (described as ""Senior Official"") to diplomatic functions and regularly traveled on U.N. aircraft in violation of organizational rules. ""Senior Official has invited Local Woman to functions both with UNMIL staff and persons outside the UN, some of which have been of an official nature,"" the report said. ""A number of staff interviewed by [U.N. investigators] expressed concern that the Local Woman was passing information which she had gathered from Senior Official to Mr. Taylor"" and others. Efforts to reach Fawaz through a former employer were unsuccessful. Klein declined to discuss the investigation, saying, ""I think I've put my family . . . through enough misery."" But he defended his tenure in Liberia, saying that he had helped to bring a crippled nation ""back to its feet"" and paved the way for democratic elections. ""I'm just trying to put all this behind me and get on with my life,"" Klein said. Among the documents posted on the Web are 32 reports, completed in 2004 and 2005, by a U.N. investigative task force into misconduct at the internationally operated airport in Pristina, including bribery, bid rigging and sexual harassment. The reports document allegations that airport staff members received payment to forge documents from Kosovars seeking entry into European capitals, and demanded kickbacks from companies seeking contracts, and sex or payments from locals seeking jobs. For years, the United Nations has guarded the confidentiality of its audits, saying they are meant as constructive criticism for managers. Their disclosure by the United States has generated a mixed reaction from U.N. officials: One said it was ironic that an administration that has placed such a premium on secrecy would be so transparent about the United Nations. The decision has rankled some senior peacekeeping officials, who said that the reports often lack context and expose individuals to embarrassment even if they were found innocent. For example, the United States posted a report describing an allegation that Klein had engaged in corruption, although he was cleared of that charge. But the top U.N. investigator, Inga-Britt Ahlenius, said that she favors more disclosure, arguing that the reports should be publicly available. ""It seems to me that the ones who argue for secret reports have something to hide,"" she said, but added that she lacks the power to release them because rules restrict their publication by U.N. staff. The reports also provide rare insight into the inner working of dozens of U.N. departments that deal with matters including  peacekeeping,  the U.N. pension fund,  the environment and the Office for Outer Space Affairs. More than 50 audits alone examine the practices of the United Nations' High Commissioner for Refugees. The audits have also provided valuable leads for investigators probing possible corruption. Former Federal Reserve chairman Paul A. Volcker, who led an investigation into U.N. corruption three years ago, battled successfully with the United Nations to publish U.N. audits on the oil-for-food program. The agreement was followed by a decision by the General Assembly to make all internal audits available when  requested by U.N. members. The United States has a standing request for every audit. Bolton's successor, Zalmay Khalilzad, has embraced the policy, saying he is now trying to persuade other U.N. agencies to make their audits available. U.S. officials say they hope the documents will allow journalists, scholars and activists to exercise greater oversight than even governments, including the United States, have the resources to provide. ""We have thought it was a good idea to make them public,"" said Khalilzad, though he acknowledged concerns about due process. ""We have sort of erred on the side of transparency and availability. . . . I hope people would be sensitive to the fact that allegations do not mean people are guilty."""20-Feb-95,UNITED STATES (99%); AFRICA (94%); ASIA (94%); LATIN AMERICA (92%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (92%); SOUTHERN ASIA (79%);,"The Senate Budget Committee staff has circulated a proposal to terminate American contributions to multilateral development banks. It is a callous and shortsighted idea that should be disowned by the committee. The United States contributes money to the United Nations Development Program -- which the proposal also threatens -- as well as several development banks, the most important of which is the World Bank. Other recipients include the Africa, Asia and Inter-American development banks, which lend to poor countries for economic development. The Budget Committee staff apparently thinks the money is wasted. The staff's judgment is myopic. It takes no account of the relatively modest contributions that Washington makes to the development banks, and shows cold indifference to the role that a wealthy and powerful country like the United States ought to play in helping desperate people subsisting on less than a dollar a day. American contributions, multiplied many times over by money from other industrialized countries, has done much to reduce infant mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, raise food production in South Asia and educate children in Latin America. The World Bank -- the largest recipient of American money -- is far from ideal. Created in the aftermath of World War II, it started off financing huge dam, transportation and other infrastructure projects. Some made sense. Others were environmental and social disasters, uprooting communities and entrenching corrupt politicians. But the bank's tactics have changed, and it is now investing more in people. The bank pours money into vaccine, nutrition, education and clean-water programs that have helped ameliorate horrific living conditions throughout Africa, Asia and Latin America. The World Bank is also an invaluable source of policy advice, helping countries set up judicial, financial and monetary institutions to carry their economies toward democracy and open markets. The United States spends about $2.5 billion on the multilateral banks and other development programs. In a $1.5 trillion Federal budget and a $6 trillion economy, these sums are small. Yet they loom large to recipients because Western allies chip in more than $10 for every dollar Washington contributes. The expenditures buy a faster-growing third world, which translates into more American exports, less military aggression, fewer refugees and more certain evolution of democratic government and open economies. Critics of development aid argue that the third world is better off opening up their economies to trade and investment than reaching for handouts from Washington. But this nostrum overlooks a harsh reality: Private investors shun the frailest cases, funneling more than 70 percent of their investment in developing countries to only 10 countries. Sub-Saharan Africa attracts only 2 percent. The development banks are the only institutions that possess the resources, expertise and will to attack crushing poverty. The United States already ranks last among industrialized countries in the percentage of its income devoted to foreign aid. It should sink no lower."5-Jun-05,UNITED STATES (99%); AFRICA (96%); UNITED KINGDOM (94%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (92%); SCOTLAND (79%); FRANCE (79%),"A powerful consensus is building for a doubling of aid to Africa among the world's heavyweight donors, except the United States, a divide that is likely to come into sharp relief this week when Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain arrives in Washington to meet with President Bush. Mr. Blair, America's closest ally, hopes to shake loose more American aid for Africa. He is expected to ask Mr. Bush on Tuesday to join the leaders of other rich nations in forging a kind of Marshall Plan for Africa; Mr. Blair has called the continent's deepening poverty ''the fundamental moral challenge of our time.'' Britain is far from alone. The European Union has found its collective voice on global poverty, too. Its 25 member nations agreed unanimously on May 24 to almost double assistance to poor countries over the next five years. Japan this week reaffirmed its pledge to double aid to Africa in just three years. But when President Bush was asked this week about Mr. Blair's effort, as well as a British proposal to raise money for development on capital markets, he replied, ''It doesn't fit our budgetary process.'' The president hastened to add that he hoped to advance a ''compassion agenda'' when Mr. Blair plays host to leaders of the Group of 8 industrialized nations in Scotland next month, but any new Africa pact would certainly be weakened without American support. Underlying this debate are differences over Africa's readiness to absorb the additional $25 billion in aid Mr. Blair advocates. The Europeans favor a quick and bold surge in spending that officials in Paris and London say will make it possible for Africa to join the global economy. Their view is buttressed by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, Mr. Blair's Africa commission and a panel of experts appointed by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan. All have said that many African nations are improving governance, fighting corruption and growing economically, and could make good use of more aid. Bush administration officials say they, too, believe aid can help. They note that the United States has tripled aid to Africa to $3.2 billion since Mr. Bush took office, with initiatives to tackle AIDS and to assist well-governed countries. Financing for those programs will grow in coming years, they say. But the United States favors a more gradual buildup of aid, the officials said. It contends that the problem is less a lack of money than the ability of poor countries with weak institutions to spend it wisely. ''If you want to spend money well, it takes time,'' said an administration official who declined to be quoted by name. The administration has said that decades of extensive aid have failed to encourage economic growth. In 2002, Mr. Bush announced plans for a Millennium Challenge Account intended to change the way aid was given out, assisting only countries that controlled corruption, invested in health and education and encouraged trade and private investment. It was financed by Congress in 2004. So far, only eight African countries have been found eligible under its stringent standards and only one -- Madagascar -- has closed a deal for an aid package. More grants will be closed in coming months. Paul V. Applegarth, who heads the program, says its approach is in the intellectual forefront. But critics complain that the money is being spent too slowly and in amounts that are still too stingy. ''They're fighting wars for hundreds of billions of dollars and what they've done for Africa is start one program for AIDS,'' said Jeffrey D. Sachs, the Columbia University economist who led a United Nations-sponsored report on poverty. ''The Millennium Challenge Account hasn't disbursed a penny yet.'' The aid debate is likely to heat up between now and September, when world leaders assess progress toward goals they set in 2000, among them to halve extreme poverty. In the longer run, if Europe does rapidly accelerate aid, it will intensify a trend, more than a generation in the making, that has left European nations the world's dominant donors. While the United States is still the single largest donor, giving about a quarter of the total, it is next to last in the share of national income it gives -- 16 cents of each $100. On average, major European nations give more than twice as much -- 36 cents of each $100. And they plan to raise that level to 51 cents of $100 by 2010. In Europe, the issue of African poverty has greater traction than in the United States because of its historical links to Africa as colonial powers, the clout of nonprofit groups like Oxfam, and the proximity of Africa, which makes the prospect of African poverty and social breakdown a security threat. Alongside the British plan, France is advocating a levy on airline tickets, either as a tax or a voluntary contribution by passengers. Thierry Breton, the French finance minister, said in an interview in Paris that he had broached the idea with John W. Snow, the United States Treasury secretary. ''I said, 'John, maybe it's a good idea you join,''' he recalled. '''If you feel comfortable with it and want to do it on a voluntary basis, fine.''' But Tony Fratto, a Treasury spokesman, said the United States was not interested in either the British or the French proposals. ''We're happy to go to Congress and ask for money,'' he said. ''We don't need a scheme or an alternate way to increase funding for development.''

During the first visit by an Algerian head of state to Washington and the White House in 16 years, Bouteflika oversaw the signing of a trade and investment framework agreement with U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick, expressing both countries' willingness to ratchet up commercial ties. In an interview Saturday, Bouteflika said Algeria ranks second, after Saudi Arabia, for total U.S. investment in the Middle East and North Africa. The current figure is $ 3 billion, which Bouteflika projected would rise to $ 8 billion in a few years. The agreement sets up a consultative process on trade and investment that will lead to a bilateral investment treaty, reciprocal trade benefits and a double taxation agreement, and in effect opens up Algeria's lucrative oil and gas resources more broadly to foreign businesses. ""Our sense of Algeria is it is a country that needs to address socioeconomic problems,"" said a U.S. official who attended most of the meetings Bouteflika held at the White House and Blair House with American counterparts. ""They need to have an investment environment that is friendly to investors, and the U.S. will help out with technical assistance in areas they need to modernize."" Although he spoke of his wish to reconcile differences among Algerians, Bouteflika's passion for national accord -- as expressed when he took office in 1999 -- has been modified to what he described as ""the politics of the possible."" Asked if his government would move to legalize the Wafa party, the political heir to the banned Islamic Salvation Front, Bouteflika cautioned that he would not incorporate elements into the country's body politic that have resorted to violence. ""I have no prejudices, but cannot do more and I cannot go any further,"" he said, noting that some moderate Islamic political factions have been legalized. ""I don't spend my time giving authorizations [for new parties]; I spend my time extinguishing fires,"" he said in reference to spasms of bloodletting that continue to plague Algeria, along with eruptions of discontent. Betraying his delicate relationship with the army, he asked that the term ""military"" not be used in referring to the country's corrupt officials. ""All Algerians profit when they can,"" he said. U.S. officials did take up with Bouteflika complaints of human rights abuses and a recent defamation law limiting freedom of expression, a State Department official said, adding, ""If Algeria wants the U.S.-Algerian relationship to grow, he has to water his whole garden."" President Miguel Angel Rodriguez of Costa Rica said in an interview Friday he had urged President Bush to become a partner in the American Convention on Human Rights, and to increase U.S. contributions to the Organization of American States. ""Matters of principle are so important, in the same way that you plant a tree in the hope that your children will enjoy it,"" Rodriguez said, noting that Bush was very much ""for strengthening"" the OAS and ""interested"" in the human rights issue. The United States has yet to ratify the American Convention on Human Rights -- known as the Pact of San Jose, after the Costa Rican capital, where it was signed -- or agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The two leaders also discussed environmental issues. Rodriguez asked that Costa Rica be forgiven $ 54 million of its $ 200 million debt to the U.S. government. He said the sum would be put into a fund to generate interest and help maintain national parks and reserves to protect Costa Rica's biodiversity. Rodriguez also asked that a $ 100 million debt Costa Rica was going to forgive Nicaragua under an initiative for highly indebted poor countries be ""swapped"" for another $ 50 million San Jose owes to the United States. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have set up a special fund for developing creditor countries such as Costa Rica to help them shoulder such initiatives. Rodriguez met with Bush, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, national security adviser Condoleezza Rice, Zoellick and members of Congress to talk about trade, the Caribbean Basin Initiative and ""fast track"" trade authority. ""We found President Bush up to speed on all issues, focused and warm,"" said Ambassador Jaime Daremblum. Zlatko Lagumdzija left Sarajevo for Washington as foreign minister July 9, slipped at the airport and broke his elbow, then returned home last week with his arm in a sling and as the choice to become Bosnia's prime minister. At a dinner the next day hosted by Madeleine K. Albright, chairman of the National Democratic Institute and former secretary of state, Lagumdzija thanked her for ""her personal impact"" in giving the region a ""future that has a lot of sun, not so many shadows."" The worst place to live as a minority, according to a Newsweek article last week, is the Balkans, he said. ""That is what my political agenda is all about,"" he said. ""I want to live in a country where there is nothing bad about being a minority."""14-Apr-07,UNITED STATES (99%); IRAQ (93%); EUROPE (92%); AFRICA (92%); AFGHANISTAN (79%); PAKISTAN (79%),"When President Bush appointed Paul D. Wolfowitz as the president of the World Bank two years ago, the White House had to put down an insurrection among European nations that viewed the administration's best-known neoconservative as a symbol of American unilateralism and arrogance. For a while, Mr. Wolfowitz seemed to defuse those fears, even taking on the Bush administration over how best to aid the poorest nations of Africa. But now it is clear that the chorus of calls in recent days for Mr. Wolfowitz's ouster is only partly about his involvement in setting up a comfortable job, with a big pay raise, for a bank officer who is Mr. Wolfowitz's companion. At its core, the fight about whether Mr. Wolfowitz should stay on at the bank is a debate about Mr. Bush and his tumultuous relationship with the rest of the world, particularly the bank, the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which have viewed themselves -- at various moments since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 -- as being at war with the Bush White House and its agenda. As finance ministers gathered in Washington on Friday for the bank's weekend meeting, Mr. Wolfowitz worked behind the scenes, seeking support for keeping his job. But there were few endorsements of his leadership beyond those offered by the Bush administration. In foreign capitals, and among the bank's staff members, it has been noted that Mr. Wolfowitz's passion for fighting corruption, which he has said saps economic life from the world's poorest nations, seemed to evaporate when it came to reviewing lending to Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan, three countries that the United States considers strategically vital. Some longtime bank staff members complained that Mr. Wolfowitz relied too little on experts in international development and too much on a pair of aides who served with him in the administration. Members of the bank's board from around the world began comparing what they called the murky way in which the bank made some policy decisions to the secretive habits of the Bush administration. Nancy Birdsall, the president of the Center for Global Development, a group that monitors aid to the world's poorest nations, described what she termed ''real doubts about Wolfowitz's judgment'' inside the bank. Mr. Wolfowitz came to the bank with heavy political baggage. Since the bank was set up at the end of World War II, its president has always been an American, a fact that has engendered more and more resentment over time. That reaction was compounded when Mr. Bush selected Mr. Wolfowitz, who had served as deputy secretary of defense and an architect of the Iraq war. ''It took a huge amount of effort to quiet this down,'' a member of the bank's board of governors and an early supporter of Mr. Wolfowitz recalled Friday of the early insurrection. ''And you would think, knowing that he was going into an institution that was deeply suspicious of him and the Bush administration, that he would have done everything he could to allay those concerns.'' At first, Mr. Wolfowitz did so. He made Africa his first priority. He displayed a passion and energy for the work -- much as he did many years ago as ambassador to Indonesia, where he immersed himself in the culture and took on a dictator, Suharto. His campaign against corruption was intellectually unassailable and quintessentially American, and he was certainly right as far as the facts were concerned, members of the bank's staff and leadership say. But eventually his focus on that issue put him at odds with career officials at an institution that is famously resistant to outside influence, and which believes that fighting poverty has to come first, even if that means dealing with countries whose leaders are not above skimming a few million dollars along the way. ''He came in to a mood of skepticism and strong reservations by many,'' said Geoffrey Lamb, a former vice president of the bank, who worked closely with Mr. Wolfowitz on questions of finance for the world's poorest nations before he retired last summer. ''My feeling was that he provided a bit of reassurance, by moving actively on aid to Africa and debt forgiveness. Clearly, those early perceptions have changed a lot.'' Over time, Mr. Wolfowitz created an impression that at critical moments he was putting American foreign policy interests first, most notably when he suspended a program in Uzbekistan after the country denied landing rights to American military aircraft, and directed huge amounts of aid to the countries he once recruited to sign on to Washington's counterterrorism agenda. It did not help that he relied heavily on a pair of aides drawn from the Bush administration, Robin Cleveland and Kevin Kellems, who created an inner circle that the bank's professional staff members said they had great trouble piercing. Mr. Wolfowitz's defenders say that he was right to come in with a mission of shaking up the ingrown bureaucracy at the bank, and that the place desperately needed shaking up. But even they acknowledge that management has never been his strong suit, and that his judgment in dealing with the transfer of his companion, Shaha Ali Riza, was questionable. In the backlash against Mr. Wolfowitz, though, there is also an undercurrent of settling scores -- including those that go beyond the World Bank. Europeans still fume over Mr. Bush's decision to send John R. Bolton, one of the biggest critics of the United Nations, to New York to serve as ambassador there -- an experiment that ended when it became clear that the newly Democratic Senate would not confirm him to finish Mr. Bush's term. Others recall that the administration tried to fire Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, the Egyptian-born head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who famously declared in early 2003 that there was no evidence Saddam Hussein had reconstituted his nuclear weapons program. Dr. ElBaradei proved to be right, and was soon awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. So far, the White House has expressed confidence in Mr. Wolfowitz, but not with much vigor. There were no signs that President Bush was about to rush to his aid, though that could still happen. European and Asian officials bet it will not. ''There is a sense that we're finally at a moment when Bush needs the world more than the world needs Bush,'' said a senior foreign official who flew into Washington recently for the annual meeting of the bank and the International Monetary Fund. ''And there's more than a little of that mixed in this whole argument over Wolfowitz's fate.''"24-Sep-05,UNITED STATES (99%); NETHERLANDS (79%); IRAQ (79%); AFRICA (79%),"Three months into his new job as president of the World Bank, Paul D. Wolfowitz caused heartburn this week for some former colleagues in the Bush administration. As finance ministers from around the world began three days of discussions here on Friday, officials closed in on an international agreement to wipe out $18 billion in debt for some of the world's poorest countries. [Page C6.] But that agreement came only after Mr. Wolfowitz publicly sided this week with officials from other countries who warned that the United States might back away from the full cost of debt relief for the poorest countries. The quiet power struggle is part of Mr. Wolfowitz's transformation from an architect of the United States' war in Iraq to a champion for the world's poor. Mr. Wolfowitz repeatedly called this week for ''stronger commitments'' by rich countries to reimburse the World Bank for lost loan repayments. He also pointedly suggested that Congress demonstrate American commitment by passing an authorization bill to cover the future costs. ''It's not that they aren't sincere,'' he told a group of reporters. ''But time passes, and I think it's very important to keep them accountable.'' American officials said that the United States made good on its promises. Hoping to mollify countries like the Netherlands, which was quietly backed by Mr. Wolfowitz, the United States produced a joint letter promising to reimburse the World Bank dollar-for-dollar on all lost repayments. Since taking over at the World Bank, Mr. Wolfowitz has called on rich countries to provide more foreign aid. He has cultivated ties with antipoverty groups like Oxfam International and Data, the advocacy group founded by Bono, the rock star. He has placed a new priority on Africa, but he also talks about goals like expanding opportunities for women, fighting corruption and improving governance in poor countries. ''It's not just about inputs of capital and labor,'' he said. ''It's about a whole range of factors, and many are not traditional economic ones.'' Not surprisingly, Mr. Wolfowitz has gone out of his way to reassure political leaders and antipoverty advocates who expressed concern that he would turn the World Bank into a tool of American ideology. Some longtime campaigners against global poverty, often sharp critics of American policy, say their first impression has been good. ''It appears that he is committed to health and education, which are nearly all of the millennium development goals,'' said Max Lawson, policy adviser to Oxfam International, referring to goals on poverty reduction and education spelled out by members of the United Nations. ''We'll be watching him very closely over the next few months to see whether he follows up on that.'' But some experts said they were worried that Mr. Wolfowitz might prove too ambitious. If there is a link between his role in the Iraq war and his role at the World Bank, they caution, it may be in his fervent belief in the ability to impose democracy on countries from the outside. ''The idea that you can spread democracy by either military intervention or through the World Bank is folly, pure folly,'' said William Easterly, a former director of research at the World Bank and a critic of the bank's policy failures. ''What I'm afraid of is that the World Bank will have more of what it already suffers from, which is mission creep -- getting involved in sweeping international causes that sound good without any evidence to show they can be accomplished.'' Mr. Wolfowitz has not forgotten about Iraq. Earlier this week, he confirmed a report in The Washington Post that he was considering sending World Bank staff members into Baghdad for the first time in two years. The bank has pledged about $500 million in aid to Iraq, but withdrew its people after insurgents blew up the United Nation's mission there and killed its top envoy. Still, Mr. Wolfowitz, the former deputy secretary of defense, has focused most of his attention elsewhere. He traveled to Africa in the summer, shortly after taking over the bank, and declared that it would be a ''special emphasis'' for the bank. Moving cautiously, he has often sounded the same themes as his predecessor, James D. Wolfensohn. Like Mr. Wolfensohn, Mr. Wolfowitz talks about the importance of reducing corruption in poor countries and promoting opportunities for women. But he has also hinted at a heavier emphasis on new agriculture technology, promoting the idea of a ''green revolution'' for Africa. And he has hinted at a renewed emphasis on infrastructure like roads, water systems and power plants. Infrastructure projects are a sensitive issue for the World Bank, which retreated from them after being criticized for financing giant bridges and dams that critics said did little to relieve poverty and damaged the environment. ''We've learned a lot from our past mistakes,'' Mr. Wolfowitz acknowledged this week. But, he said, entrepreneurs and farmers could not begin to realize their potential if they lacked electricity, clean water or roads to move their products to market. The World Bank makes $18 billion to $20 billion in loans and grants a year to low-income countries. But its finances depend on loan repayments and fresh donations from wealthy nations. For all its size, its scale is small in comparison with the private investment that flows through Latin America and Asia. ''I don't hear any new vision yet,'' said Nancy Birdsall, founder of the Center on Global Development, a nonpartisan research organization here. ''The big issues are not about internal management but about what the role of the World Bank is going to be in the 21st century. Right now, the banks products are still 1960's-style products -- loans to governments, infrastructure loans.'' Few people would argue that Mr. Wolfowitz, a former dean of Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, is short on ideas. But supporters of increased aid to poor countries, including those who adamantly opposed Mr. Wolfowitz's role in invading Iraq, said this week that his vision for the future might be less important right now than his close relationship to President Bush.  URL: http://www.nytimes.com"30-Nov-07,"VENEZUELA, BOLIVARIAN REPUBLIC OF (99%); AZERBAIJAN (92%); NIGERIA (92%); VENEZUELA (90%); LATIN AMERICA (79%)","As petrodollars stream into oil-producing countries, Western officials have begun to demand greater accountability for how they are spent. Some countries known for corruption, like Nigeria and Azerbaijan, have heeded the call, increasing their financial transparency, or at least paying lip service to it. But Venezuela under the leadership of President Hugo Chavez appears headed in the opposite direction. ''We see Venezuela on the other side of the road,'' said Mercedes de Freitas, executive director of Transparency International here. The group, which tries to combat corruption worldwide, ranks Venezuela as the least transparent country in Latin America and 162 out of 179 nations globally. And that could soon fall even lower. On Sunday, Venezuelans will vote on constitutional changes that would, among other things, grant Mr. Chavez unparalleled power to run the country's finances as he sees fit. If the referendum is approved, government accounting is expected to become still harder to fathom, and foreign businesses, many of them already afraid to invest, will find Venezuela even more forbidding. Already, Mr. Chavez's government is putting large amounts of oil revenue into development funds and state-owned companies that operate outside the official budget  and are  not subject to audits or legislative approval. The Fund for National Development, a leading fund of this sort, has received more than $30 billion since 2005 without regularly disclosing its balance, the progress of projects it finances, the whereabouts of billions of dollars it invests in bonds, or how often it receives revenue injections from the state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela. Under the proposed changes, Mr. Chavez seeks to formally strip the central bank of its autonomy, giving him the power to dictate monetary policy and the spending of excess foreign-currency reserves. Another measure would eliminate an already neglected rainy-day fund. Opinion polls released in the last week have found Mr. Chavez's proposals tied or trailing the opposition position among likely voters, after months of polls showing it likely to pass. In recent weeks, students have rallied in Caracas to protest the changes, and some  of those demonstrations have turned violent. On Thursday, tens of thousands of people flooded the streets of the capital in opposition to the referendum proposals. Venezuela's  foreign minister, Nicolas Maduro, asserted on Wednesday that a United States Embassy official was conspiring to defeat the referendum proposals, and threatened to expel the diplomat. And Mr. Chavez said this week that CNN was trying to instigate his assassination. Like this sort of political volatility, reduced access to information on public finances is expected to make investing in Venezuela a riskier prospect, said Francisco Rodriguez, who teaches economics and Latin American studies at Wesleyan University. Investors in Venezuelan bonds already struggle to ascertain what assets back the country's debt and what resources it could count on in the event of a financial crisis. Oil profits are the basis of Mr. Chavez's intended socialist revolution, which aims to help the poor in Venezuela and other countries. Petrodollars finance social benefits including free health care, free education and government-subsidized food, and oil profits permit the vast  public spending that has helped create nearly four years of economic growth. But large chunks of revenue have been managed opaquely  --  to a degree that it is hard to measure the state's success in carrying out its social projects or in monitoring corruption. ''It's not really clear how the money is invested,'' said Theresa Paiz-Fredel, a senior director of Fitch Ratings. The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, a program started by the British government with support from the World Bank, says that a lack of clarity in oil-revenue management can be a sign of the ''resource curse,'' where natural resources fuel corruption and undermine the rule of law instead of contributing to long-term growth. Venezuela is not one of the 15 signers of the initiative, and some economists say it is laboring under the curse. They point to corruption charges this year against the state oil company, leveled by a pro-Chavez lawmaker. Officials denied wrongdoing, but eventually conceded that the oil company had too few rigs. Separately, a director of Petroleos de Venezuela resigned after a shadowy incident involving company executives, a charter flight to Buenos Aires with a Venezuelan businessman, and a briefcase with $800,000 in cash. Facing mounting criticism, Finance Minister Rodrigo Cabezas has released two reports this year disclosing the Fund for National Development's  revenue balance, and he promised in May to conduct a comprehensive audit of all projects the fund financed  to give it ''more transparency.'' But analysts trying to gain access to the data  are still frustrated, saying that the reports are neither detailed nor frequent enough. The New York Times requested interviews to obtain details on the fund from the finance ministry, the central bank, Petroleos de Venezuela and the state-run Banco del Tesoro. After more than two months of efforts, none of those organizations granted an interview or provided any information. Simon Escalona, vice president of the National Assembly's finance commission, said he had not ''seen any lack of transparency'' in  the development fund. But, Mr. Escalona was unable to provide updated information on its total assets, bond investments or on transfers from the state oil company to the fund. Mr. Chavez has long sought control over Venezuela's foreign reserves. The central bank has already lost much of its independence; a report in March by Barclays Capital said transfers from the bank to the Fund for National Development were determined more by Mr. Chavez than the bank. Still, the central bankers  occasionally criticize government policy, a practice likely to end if the referendum passes, as will most public debate on state spending, Mr. Rodriguez of Wesleyan said. And the unfettered spending of reserves could increase inflation, at 17 percent already the highest in Latin America. ''They will stop being foreign reserves,'' Mr. Rodriguez said, and become just ''another account.'' In October, Fitch Ratings lowered Venezuela's outlook to negative from stable, saying that inflation and a weakening currency had made it vulnerable to a decrease in oil prices. Still, oil-producing countries are not generally known for their transparency. Qatar, for instance, does not publish figures for its large investment fund, which is fed by oil revenue, according to Luc Marchand, an analyst at Standard & Poor's. But even Russia, despite criticism that the government is weakening institutions, is adopting a system used by Norway that will integrate its main oil fund into the budget and make it easier to track, according to Frank Gill, also of Standard & Poor's. And authorities in Moscow have strict investment criteria for the oil fund. Venezuela differs from Russia and many petrostates, including Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, in another way. Those countries all run budget surpluses, while Venezuela's heavy social spending results in a deficit, according to data compiled by Mr. Marchand. Some economists,  like Mark Weisbrot at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, say that social spending, which he puts at 21 percent of the gross domestic product last year, is proof that Mr. Chavez is combating the resource curse. Mr. Weisbrot points to government statistics showing that poverty has fallen to nearly30 percent from 44 percent since Mr. Chavez was elected nine years ago, and  unemployment has dropped to 8 percent from 15 percent. Mr. Chavez frames his designs on full control of oil revenue as part of a crusade against Washington-based institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which he says advance American business interests. A deputy finance minister, Rafael Isea, told state television last summer that eliminating the central bank's autonomy would curb the I.M.F.'s ability to ''manage our reserves and influence internal policies.'' The government has nationalized electric and phone companies here that once had American companies as stockholders, has ceased filing financial reports of the state oil company to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and has announced plans to withdraw Venezuela from the I.M.F. and the World Bank. In September, Mr. Chavez ordered the oil company to convert its investment accounts from dollars to euros and Asian currencies. The march to socialism has not been as smooth as he  may have hoped. Officials became aware that plans to leave the I.M.F. could conceivably result in a default of  Venezuelan debt. Months after the announcement, the country is still part of the I.M.F. Students of history warn that the 1970s oil boom also coincided with heavy spending and questionable accountability. In his book ''The Magical State,'' Fernando Coronil, a professor of history and anthropology at the University of Michigan, documents how policies intended to spur development in the 1970s loaded Venezuela with debt and helped create financial crisis in the 1980s and '90s. ''It's one thing to declare the intent to use these resources for the benefit of the population, it's another to prove it,'' he said, ''and in order to do that you have to have checks and balances.''"18-May-07,ZAMBIA (79%); PAKISTAN (79%),"Now that Paul Wolfowitz has agreed to resign, his successor at the World Bank will have to  grapple with his signature issue: the fight against corruption. Wolfowitz mishandled this challenge so badly that it poisoned his tenure, and the bank's next president will be tempted to avoid it. But the challenge of corruption and, more broadly, of weak institutions in developing nations must not be neglected. When Wolfowitz took the helm of the World Bank in 2005, everyone agreed that institution-building was essential. The ""Washington Consensus"" phase of development thinking, which held that pro-market policies would lift countries out of poverty, had given way in the mid-1990s to a new view: The policies you adopt can matter less than the skill with which you implement them. Russia had embraced big-bang market reforms but collapsed in a corrupt mess. China cleaved to an unorthodox mix of statism and markets, but skillful implementation produced an economic miracle. Three prescriptions followed. If success depends on implementation, it's essential to get the implementers' enthusiastic commitment to whatever policy is chosen, so aid agencies began to restrain their tendency to dictate policies. Development loans ceased to be loaded up with hundreds of conditions, and the new buzzword was ""ownership."" Poor nations would henceforth choose their own development priorities. To cite another cliche of the time, they would be ""in the driver's seat."" If poor countries get the keys to the car, some will drive toward the cliff; aid for these states will be wasted. So the next prescription to emerge in the late 1990s was ""selectivity"": Aid must be targeted at developing nations that are driving in a smart direction. The World Bank and other agencies began to concentrate their money more, and in 2002 President Bush unveiled the Millennium Challenge Account, which reserved all its cash for a handful of countries with good policies. Ownership and selectivity are fine, but what about the billion or so poor people who live in countries with bad drivers? Abandoning them is unacceptable politically as well as morally. The public's support for aid is based on the expectation that it will reach the poorest of the poor -- and that it will help to stabilize misgoverned, fragile states that threaten Western interests. Hence the third 1990s prescription: If good implementation is essential to development, the aid business has to strengthen the institutions in poor states that make good implementation possible. If education projects fail in Pakistan because the money is stolen, create a prosecutor's office to go after corruption. If the private sector is stifled in Zambia because government officials are on the take, roll up your sleeves and reform the civil service. This cry for institution-building turned out to have big consequences. After the terrorist attacks of 2001, it crossed from the aid folk into the foreign policy community, stoking an appetite for nation-building that was at once liberal and neoconservative. Creating robust institutions was suddenly part of the battle against Third World poverty and part of the battle for First World security, since broken institutions created terrorist havens in poor countries. Now this enthusiasm for creating institutions is gone. The failure of nation-building in Afghanistan and Iraq began this change; the failure of Wolfowitz at the World Bank threatens to complete it. Wolfowitz marched into the corruption battle without planning for the postwar; he declared the issue a priority without explaining what he would do about it. He never grappled with the verdict of the bank's Internal Evaluation Group: In a recent study of institution-building loans in 35 countries, the evaluators found that corruption receded in just one of them. The lesson for the next World Bank president is that corruption must be attacked subtly. The bank's ambitious institution-building efforts have generally failed for the same reason old-style aid conditions didn't work: Donors don't have the clout to force change; reform must be ""owned"" locally. But the bank has succeeded better with indirect approaches. An African government is unlikely to come to the bank, confess its corruption and request help in fixing it. But it might ask for assistance with urban water, at which point the bank can explain that, along with extra reservoirs and pipes, success requires greater transparency in water management. The bank can also do a lot to stoke demand for change in poor countries. Training investigative journalists gets corruption out into the open, and media revelations create more pressure to root out graft than hectoring from foreign donors. Getting facts into the hands of citizens can have a tremendous effect, too. If villagers know how much government money their school is meant to get, they'll pressure school administrators to steal less of it. This demand-side approach has worked wonders in Uganda, transforming the performance of both schools and clinics. The neoconservative moment has passed. For good or possibly for ill, the appetite for ambitious nation-building has evaporated. But there are excellent reasons that development experts made fighting corruption a priority 10 years ago: If you want to make a difference in dysfunctional poor states, there is no way to avoid it. Wolfowitz's successor can make a difference by backing modest and practical corruption-fighting measures. He or she should not run from the agenda. smallaby@cfr.org"10-Jun-09,ZAMBIA (94%); AFRICA (94%); SOUTH AFRICA (92%); NIGERIA (92%); BURUNDI (79%); KENYA (79%); ENGLAND (67%),"The fight against corruption in Africa's most pivotal nations is faltering as public agencies investigating wrongdoing by powerful politicians have been undermined or disbanded and officials leading the charge have been dismissed, subjected to death threats and driven into exile. ''We are witnessing an era of major backtracking on the anticorruption drive,'' said Daniel Kaufmann, an authority on corruption who works at the Brookings Institution. ''And one of the most poignant illustrations is the fate of the few anticorruption commissions that have had courageous leadership. They're either embattled or dead.'' Experts, prosecutors and watchdog groups say they fear that major setbacks to anticorruption efforts in South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya are weakening the resolve to root out graft, a stubborn scourge that saps money needed to combat poverty and disease in the world's poorest region. And in Zambia, a change of leadership has stoked fears that the country's zealous prosecution of corruption is ebbing. The perils of challenging deeply rooted patterns of corruption have been brought home recently with the suspicious deaths of two anticorruption campaigners. Ernest Manirumva, who worked with a nonprofit group, Olucome, investigating high-level corruption in Burundi, was stabbed to death in the early morning hours of April 9. A bloodstained folder lay empty on his bed. Documents and a computer flash drive were missing, said the president of Olucome, Gabriel Rufyiri. And in the Congo Republic, Bruno Jacquet Ossebi, a journalist who had announced he was joining a lawsuit brought by Transparency International to reclaim the ill-gotten wealth of his country's president, died of injuries from a fire that raced through his home in the early hours of Jan. 21. The broader anxieties about Africa's resolve to combat corruption have emerged from troubled efforts in several countries. In oil-rich Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, where watchdog groups say efforts to combat corruption are backsliding, Nuhu Ribadu, who built a well-trained staff of investigators at the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, said he fled his homeland into self-imposed exile in England in December. Officials had sent Mr. Ribadu away to a training course a year earlier, soon after his agency charged a wealthy, politically connected former governor with trying to bribe officials on his staff with huge sacks stuffed with $15 million in $100 bills. Mr. Ribadu, who was dismissed from the police force last year, said he had  received death threats and was fired upon in September by assailants. ''If you fight corruption, it fights you back,'' he said. In South Africa, home to the region's biggest economy, a new crime unit with less statutory protection from political interference was stripped of the authority to both investigate and prosecute crimes. It will take over from the Scorpions, the prosecuting authority's elite investigating unit that had achieved high conviction rates and built potent corruption cases against Jacob Zuma, who became president of South Africa in April, and Jackie Selebi, the national police commissioner and an ally of former President Thabo Mbeki. The Scorpions were abolished last year and the country's chief prosecutor, Vusi Pikoli, who had pushed forward with both cases, was fired. ''Even people of good will would be slow to take on people in high places again because history will have told them it comes at a high cost,'' said Wim Trengrove, a private lawyer  who assisted the state with the prosecution of Mr. Zuma. And in Kenya, the economic anchor of east Africa, scandals have continued to flourish and anticorruption prosecutions have languished since John Githongo, who was the country's anticorruption chief, sought safety in self-imposed exile in England in 2005.  Aaron Ringera, who apparently advised Mr. Githongo in taped conversations in 2005 not to push for prosecutions of President Mwai Kibaki's ministers, is the current anticorruption chief. Mr. Ringera said in an e-mail message that Mr. Githongo had twisted advice he offered him ''in his own best interests.'' In an  interview, he said he had recommended prosecuting eight ministers, but had been blocked by either the courts or the attorney general. The search is on for more effective ways to tackle corruption, including intensified legal efforts to prosecute multinational corporations that pay the bribes and reclaim loot that African political elites have stashed abroad. Transparency International's suit seeks to force the French justice system to investigate how the leaders of Gabon, the Congo Republic and Equatorial Guinea and their families acquired tens of millions of dollars in assets there. Still others say rich countries and international organizations that provide billions of dollars in  aid to African countries each year must more vigorously use their leverage to make sure aid does not fuel corruption. Based on his finding that more than $1 trillion a year is paid in bribery globally, Mr. Kaufmann, formerly director of global programs at the World Bank Institute, estimates there are tens of billions of dollars of corrupt transactions each year in sub-Saharan Africa. Mr. Githongo, who failed in trying   to fight corruption from the inside, has returned to Nairobi to start a nonprofit group to   mobilize rural people to press politicians to clean up a rotten system. ''Going after big fish hasn't worked,'' he  said. ''The fish will not fry themselves.'' Zambia recently won rare convictions against former military commanders and Regina Chiluba, the wife of its former president, on corruption charges. Frederick Chiluba, president from 1991 to 2001, will himself   face a verdict in July on corruption charges. His sumptuous wardrobe -- Lanvin suits, silk pajamas and handmade Italian shoes of snakeskin, satin and ostrich -- became an emblem of greed in one of the world's poorest countries. But anticorruption leaders say they sense less commitment to tackle corruption since the election of President Rupiah Banda. ''I'm inside,'' said Maxwell Nkole, who leads a task force set up to investigate the Chiluba-era abuses. ''The tempo, the intensity to tackle corruption is dropping.'' The Banda administration vigorously denies that charge, and says it will prosecute officials who stole $2 million from the Ministry of Health. At stake are hundreds of millions of dollars in grants from the United States' Millennium Challenge Corporation that Zambia is eligible for.  On a recent afternoon, ambassadors from rich nations, the United States and Britain among them, mingled at a party on the lawn of Mark Chona, the first chief of the Zambian anticorruption task force. In welcoming them, he issued a sharp warning. ''Your money is being stolen,''  he said. ''Don't sit silent. You don't know how much influence you have.''"20-Aug-08,ZAMBIA (98%); ZIMBABWE (94%); AFRICA (94%); EGYPT (93%); FRANCE (92%); UNITED STATES (79%),"Levy Mwanawasa, 59, the president of Zambia, whose criticism of the political and economic crisis of neighboring Zimbabwe helped break the traditional silence of African leaders toward one of their own, died Aug. 19 at a hospital in Paris after a stroke. Mr. Mwanawasa suffered a stroke June 29 at an African Union summit in Egypt. He was flown to Paris for treatment July 1. He had a reputation for integrity and fought corruption in his country but never managed to lift the Zambian people out of crushing poverty. Mr. Mwanawasa was Zambia's third president since independence from Britain in 1964 and was not bound by the liberation movement ties of older African leaders. He was the first among them to criticize autocratic Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, who had long been revered as an African independence hero. Mr. Mwanawasa's death leaves a power vacuum in Zambia, one of the world's biggest copper producers. Under the constitution, elections should be held within 90 days. Levy Patrick Mwanawasa was born Sept. 3, 1948, in Mufulira in what was then Northern Rhodesia. He graduated from the University of Zambia and practiced law before entering government service. After a stint as solicitor general in 1986, he soon became a key figure in the push for multiparty democracy. When Frederick Chiluba defeated Zambia's first president, Kenneth Kaunda, in Zambia's first multiparty elections in 1991, Mr. Mwanawasa was appointed vice president. He then quit, complaining of corruption. Even so, Chiluba chose Mr. Mwanawasa to be his successor. Mr. Mwanawasa won the presidency in 2001 in an election marred by allegations of fraud and was reelected in 2006 with 43 percent of the vote in an election that was generally regarded as fair. As he sought to establish his legitimacy in his first term, Mr. Mwanawasa seized on anti-corruption and economic changes and targeted Chiluba, who was found guilty in a London court of stealing $46 million from state coffers during his 10-year rule. Mr. Mwanawasa won praise from the business community and middle class Zambians as well as many Western donors and investors for his free market policies. He tamed inflation and, after years of economic stagnation, presided over a period of growth helped by a boom in global copper prices. Mr. Mwanawasa's economic austerity and market-opening policies drew support from the United States, the World Bank and lending institutions, which agreed in 2005 to cancel nearly all of Zambia's $7.2 billion foreign debt. Critics accused Mr. Mwanawasa of turning a blind eye to the plight of the poor in a country where less than 20 percent of the population has formal employment and the majority lives below the poverty line. Opponents also said Mr. Mwanawasa pandered to the whims of Western donors. Mr. Mwanawasa countered that it was thanks to the forgiveness of foreign debt that he was able to increase spending on education and health. Populist rival Michael Sata and other critics also said he was too subservient to China, which poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Zambia's copper sector. Mr. Mwanawasa accused the West of failing to follow through on promises of increased aid and trade. Africa ""is in the hands of Europe"" but needs China's economic aid, Mr. Mwanawasa told an audience of U.S. students last year. ""You people in the West redeem yourself before you begin attacking China,"" he said."16-Feb-01,ZAMBIA (99%); AFRICA (92%); BAHAMAS (79%),"Several weeks before the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund granted debt relief to 22 poor nations in December, evidence began to surface that one nation, Zambia, had ""imprudent and irregular"" dealings in mineral sales that cost the African nation $60 million in lost revenues, according to a confidential auditor's report that detailed the losses. In 1998 and 1999, the draft report said, managers at the state-owned mining company had struck an exclusive contract with a Bahamas company for the sale of its cobalt.  The contract was struck more than a year before Zambia's copper mining and cobalt processing industries were sold to private, mainly South African, buyers. At prevailing market prices, the report said, sales of cobalt, often derived in copper and nickel mining and used to make alloys, cell-phone batteries and other products, should have earned $95 million for Zambia in 1998 and 1999. But, the report said, the national accounts showed an income of $30 million. ""The discrepancy highlights a serious cause for concern regarding the sales of cobalt metal during this period,"" the auditors stated. A draft copy of the report was obtained by The New York Times. Put more directly, the missing revenues were equal to two years of the debt relief offered a month after the report's completion by the World Bank and I.M.F. as part of a program to encourage sound financial management from extremely poor countries. Many of the debts date from the cold war era of superpower rivalry, when aid was used to build loyalty to the West. Faced with political and other pressures from Western governments and advocacy groups, the World Bank and I.M.F. decided last year to include Zambia in the list of countries to receive debt relief, according to officials with the two institutions. Because the mines were in private hands and the missing millions from cobalt sales were supposedly under investigation, World Bank and I.M.F. officials said, Zambia was committed to greater financial transparency. This weekend, James D. Wolfensohn, president of the bank, and Horst Kohler, managing director of the fund, plan to embark on an African tour to discuss the continent's economic malaise. But as the episode with Zambia's debt relief showed, the institutions confront politically charged issues that are far broader than those raised by protesters opposed to the two agencies' role in the global economy. On one hand, they are being pressed to give relief to the poorest nations. Before relief was extended, Zambia's debt amounted to $5 billion, more than five times its annual foreign exchange earnings. On the other hand, Western institutions have to avoid the allegation that by forgiving debts they are helping foster corruption and mismanaged economies. ""We operate as institutions in extremely hostile environments,"" an I.M.F. official said. ""There are always balances that are going to have to be struck in some fashion."" The Zambia case illustrated the judgments that entails. In June, at the prompting of the fund and the bank, Zambia committed itself to an independent investigation of cobalt sales. At that time, it had largely completed the privatization of state-owned copper mines that had been incurring huge losses even as they provided the country's sole source of foreign exchange and had come to be seen as a font of patronage. The inquiry was financed by the European Union, which paid for an accounting firm from Mauritius, De Chazal du Mee, to conduct it. In November, the firm produced its report on the dealings in 1998 and 1999 between the state-owned mining company, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, and a Bahamas company, the Metal Resources Group, or M.R.G. The history is murky because the auditors have not, by their admission, been able to interview Zambian managers or to see the full range of contracts. M.R.G. says it has not seen the draft report either. The auditors, Metal Resources said in a statement sent by e-mail, ""did their work without hearing our side of the story."" A spokesman for the company, Gavin Sanderson, said in a telephone interview: ""All the metal M.R.G. bought from Zambia was bought on normal commercial terms. We honored the contracts to the full, to the letter and the t. It would be a misconception that we had taken money from the Zambians and put it in our pockets."" But he added that the contracts ""exposed both sides to normal commercial risk."" According to a debt relief specialist at the World Bank, Tony Gaeta, the total relief offered to Zambia will reduce its overall debt, to $1.4 billion from $5.2 billion in 1999, and will save the country $30 million a year in the next 15 years, after it has repaid additional arrears falling due to the I.M.F. That would be dependent on continued efforts toward economic reform and accountability. ""The old paradigm was the superpower paradigm"" of aid and loans extended to nations in return for their loyalty to the West, an official at the fund said. But in the view of some fund officials the very fact that the Zambian authorities have publicly commissioned an audit -- however incomplete -- and pledged a full investigation of the cobalt sales highlighted an important shift in attitudes. What the Zambian report had shown, the official said, was that ""there's a realization under way here, a trend that these governments understand that the old paradigm doesn't work anymore."""21-Nov-99,ZIMBABWE (97%); UNITED KINGDOM (92%); SOUTHERN AFRICA (79%);,"What ultimately got to Lincoln Shenge was not the meager pay or the long hours that he puts in at this city's main hospital. It wasn't the constant shortages of even the most basic medical supplies: soap, clean towels, surgical gloves. The young doctors managed that well enough, and Shenge even learned how to make do without painkillers, warning patients on the operating table that they ""would just have to be brave."" In the end, Shenge and the other 600 doctors went on strike because none of them could bear to lose another patient needlessly while the government spends at least $ 3 million a month to fight a war in neighboring Congo that hardly anyone here seems to want. ""The doctors, we can't even afford a car,"" said Shenge, 23. ""When I get paged by the hospital for an emergency call, I have to flag down a [bus] and just hope and pray that there's no other passengers on board who have to be dropped off ahead of me. We've all lost patients that way. Our government has got to get its priorities straight."" With inflation soaring, a quarter of its 12 million people infected with AIDS and two-thirds living in poverty, Zimbabwe's widespread suffering represents this country's greatest test of faith since a civil war wrenched it from British rule 19 years ago. Never before has this southern African country so publicly questioned the autocratic leadership of its founding father, President Robert Mugabe, whose rebel militia toppled the British colony known as Rhodesia. A coalition of labor unions, churches and civic groups have formed the country's first opposition party, which is challenging Mugabe's governing party, Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, in next year's parliamentary elections. A grass roots effort to rewrite the constitution that gives Mugabe unchecked authority has led to a national outpouring of political grievances, gathering so much momentum that government officials have tried to co-opt the process. And the emergence of a critical, independent press allows no misstep to go unnoticed, reinforcing almost daily the popular image of the government as a corrupt ruling elite, whose indifference to ordinary citizens is a betrayal of the independence movement that earned Zimbabwe the world's admiration more than two decades ago. ""The economic and social crisis is so unprecedented that everyone realizes we need a change, but every time we talk about the future, they bring up the past,"" said Morgan Tsvangirai, a labor unionist who heads the Movement for Democratic Change, the newly formed opposition party. ""They've remained arrogant, locked in a time warp, unwilling to hear dissent, unable to come up with new ideas, unaccountable for their corruption and failings. We need a new vision. The liberator has become a liability."" Dissatisfaction with Mugabe is not new. Periodic uprisings in the form of labor strikes, student protests and even small-scale riots have been part of Zimbabwe's civic culture for several years. But Mugabe's decision more than a year ago to send 10,000 troops to Congo to help defend President Laurent Kabila's autocratic government from foreign-backed rebel forces has hardened attitudes and formed the first droplets of a revolution. Despite Mugabe's contention that the military commitment is necessary to defend a neighbor and investment partner from aggressors who could further destabilize southern Africa, very few believe that Zimbabwe can afford the war. In a nationwide survey last year, 70 percent of respondents said they opposed the country's military involvement in Congo. The government's proposal last month to introduce an ""AIDS tax"" on all payroll costs has been condemned by business, labor and civic organizations who say that no additional levy would be necessary were it not for the 58 percent increase in the Defense Ministry's budget. ""Why bother putting out a fire next door,"" said Andrew Mutandwa, a former Mugabe spokesman who now works for an AIDS awareness group, ""when your own house is on fire."" Said John Makumbe, a University of Zimbabwe political science professor last month, ""The Congo is a big rock that Mugabe has tied to the country. It's heavy and bound to take many down."" The fissures in Zimbabwe represent Africa's maturing efforts to find its own way in the generation following the liberation of most of the continent from its European rulers. The emergent states, scholars and diplomats say, have essentially mapped out three different roads leading toward a post-colonial world, with nations like South Africa, Nigeria and Mozambique moving toward economic growth and democracy. But states like Congo and Angola are plunging deeper into catastrophic civil wars and economic ruin, and other nations, like Zimbabwe, seem stalled by poor governance and undeveloped democracies. ""Leaders run out of ideas and legitimacy but hang on nonetheless, taking repressive measures to compensate for those two necessary but fading virtues,"" said William Zartman, a professor of international relations at Johns Hopkins University. ""Mugabe is by now a rotten gift to his country, yet there is no legal and practicable way to retire him. The lesson is again one in full support of democracy. Democracy does not guarantee good results, but it does guarantee the removal of bad ones."" Mugabe's office did not return a reporter's phone calls, but Mugabe has told reporters previously that requirements of international donors, particularly the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, are largely responsible for the expansion of poverty in Zimbabwe. And he has resisted all suggestions that his time has passed. ""I know the door through which I came into politics,"" the 75-year-old Mugabe said earlier this year, ""and I know the door I should use to get out of politics."" Mugabe's installation of free-market reforms over the past eight years has appeased international donors but done little else. Undermined by an increasingly competitive business climate, halting efforts to privatize state enterprises and crumbling infrastructure, Zimbabwe has lost almost 40 percent of its manufacturing sector over the past decade. And since the currency collapsed two years ago, prices for food, fuel and other goods have risen by almost 70 percent, a record high. Wages have failed to keep pace, triggering a series of strikes by public-sector employees. When the doctors ended their six-week strike earlier this month, in return for government assurances that their salaries would be reviewed and the national health budget raised, 9,000 nurses walked out. They have since returned to work. But it is not so much that things seem to be going so badly. Rather, it is that many people here don't believe that the government is even trying to improve conditions. Only public outrage stopped Mugabe's cabinet members this fall from approving a 182 percent raise for themselves. And Mugabe's lavish homes, tailored suits and frequent travels have begun to grate on his constituents' nerves. ""The week that the hospitals shut down because all the doctors went on strike, there were pictures on television of Mugabe attending a wedding in Malawi,"" said Mutandwa. ""People are asking: 'Does anyone even care what's happening to us?' "" Any such criticism would have seemed heretical a decade ago. Following Zimbabwe's independence, Mugabe's newly formed government embarked on an ambitious effort to strengthen health and education for indigenous Africans whose welfare had been ignored by the colonial government. His socialist health care and education policies made Zimbabwe's public hospitals and schools among the continent's best. But many of those gains have been reversed in recent years as funding for health and education has been slashed, in part to comply with donors' requirements for financial aid. ""Mugabe is like a silent movie star, said one Western diplomat. ""He was good in his day. But we've got the talkies now.""

The opposition's candidate rejected the results, saying the vote was rigged. In Washington, President Bush said the United States did not ""recognize the outcome of the election because we think it's flawed."" Speaking at a White House news conference, Bush said: ""We are dealing with our friends to figure out how to deal with this flawed election."" Unofficial results showed the 78-year-old Mugabe winning a fourth presidential term in a landslide over Morgan Tsvangirai, a former labor organizer and leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). With about 3.1 million of the nation's 5.6 million registered voters casting ballots, officials said, Mugabe won more than 1.6 million votes to Tsvangirai's 1.2 million. Several preelection polls had showed Mugabe trailing Tsvangirai, and the announcement today of the president's wide margin of victory drew prompt accusations of fraud from the opposition. ""The Movement for Democratic Change is firmly of the view that the election results do not reflect the true will of the people of Zimbabwe and are consequently illegitimate in the eyes of the people,"" Tsvangirai told reporters here today. ""We therefore do not accept them."" Likewise, several election monitoring groups cast doubt on the validity of the vote, describing an electoral process disfigured by violence, intimidation, mass arrests and last-minute changes to election laws and logistics that effectively disenfranchised tens of thousands of voters. Monitors from a handful of African nations, however, declared the election free and fair. As the results were announced, Zimbabwe's army was put on ""full alert"" and deployed in urban centers, where the MDC draws its core support, to address any civil unrest. Sporadic skirmishes between supporters of the two candidates erupted throughout the day here in Harare, the capital, but none resulted in any serious injuries. The election was widely regarded as the continent's most pivotal since South Africans of all races went to the polls eight years ago, ending decades of oppressive white-minority rule. Mugabe and his supporters here and abroad described the election as a question of whether Africans would retain political power in Zimbabwe or hand it over to whites from the West -- who were among the supporters of Tsvangirai's candidacy -- a generation after the end of colonial rule. David Nyekorach-Matsanga, a supporter of Mugabe's ruling party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), today called Mugabe's victory a triumph against the forces of colonialism and imperialism. ""The MDC represents the white man in the United States and in Britain,"" he said. ""I say that only Americans should decide the future of their country; only the British should decide the future of Britain. Well, I am Zimbabwean, and only Zimbabweans should decide the future of this country."" But the MDC's African and white supporters called the issues of race and colonial rule a smoke screen for Mugabe and his party's misrule, corruption and mishandling of the economy since leading Zimbabwe to independence in 1980. Instead, they argued that this election revolved around the issues of good governance and whether Africans were willing to let go of the colonial past and move toward multiparty democracy and economic growth through global trade. Tsvangirai said today that the ZANU-PF manipulated the results through a two-year campaign of violence in which opposition supporters were beaten and killed by mobs led by veterans from the country's independence war and young militants recruited by the party. MDC politicians were unable to campaign in some areas because of widespread violence, poll workers were abducted during the three-day election period, and a reduction in the number of polling stations in MDC strongholds prevented nearly 360,000 voters from casting ballots before voting ended Monday evening, he said. ""This was done through state-sponsored terrorism conducted by ZANU-PF militia, rogue elements in the war veterans, ZANU-PF youths and, in some instances, with the active or passive connivance of the police,"" Tsvangirai said. Government officials contend that the state played no role in the violence that led to more than 100 deaths over the past two years and that the MDC was responsible for most of the attacks, not ZANU-PF. ""These elections were held in a free and fair manner,"" said Emmerson Mnangagwa, a senior ZANU-PF lawmaker and parliamentary speaker who explained the shift in polling places from urban centers to rural areas that typically support ZANU-PF as intended to expand access to voters in the countryside. Mugabe, a leader of guerrilla forces in the independence struggle in what was then white-ruled Rhodesia, was one of Africa's most celebrated heroes when voters chose him to head the country in 1980. A former Marxist who reluctantly adopted free-market reforms after the Cold War, Mugabe oversaw free health and educational systems that were once regarded as the jewels of Africa, making Zimbabweans the continent's most literate population. But Mugabe's deployment of troops to Congo in 1998 to fight an unpopular civil war and his land-reform program, in which the country's most fertile farmland was seized from prosperous whites and redistributed to poor, landless blacks, prompted the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and a host of donor countries to cut off much of their aid to Zimbabwe. As a result, unemployment here has reached 60 percent, the inflation rate was 112 percent last year and, according to the U.N. World Health Organization, food shortages threaten a half-million Zimbabweans with starvation. Western governments that once enthusiastically supported Mugabe joined the Southern African Development Community (SADC) today in condemning the violence, the election law revisions and many other problems, saying the election fell short of democratic standards. ""The climate of insecurity . . . was such that the electoral process could not be said to adequately comply with the norms and standards for elections in the SADC region,"" said Duke Lefhoko, head of the SADC's Parliamentary Forum observer mission. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said the vote did not reflect the will of the people. ""As a result, Mr. Mugabe may claim victory, but not democratic legitimacy,"" Powell said in a statement. Observers from South Africa, Namibia and Nigeria acknowledged today that violence occurred during the campaign, but endorsed the election as legitimate, dismissing allegations of harassment and intimidation by the state as one-sided and exaggerated. South African observers described the reduction of polling stations in urban areas as an ""administrative oversight."" An Organization of African Unity observer team said that ""in general the elections were transparent, credible, free and fair."" On the streets of Harare today, truckloads of ZANU-PF supporters danced and cheered their party's victory, but more people here seemed frustrated and disbelieving. ""The old man has stolen the election,"" said David Ndlovu, a taxi driver. ""Our economy is already biting into our flesh. We are about to feel what it's like when the economy bites into the bone. I fear that my country will become a pariah state like apartheid South Africa, and where will the jobs come from then?"" Waving a ZANU-PF flag and laughing almost uncontrollably, Mutuma Mawere, a local businessman, said that the MDC and its supporters had miscalculated the will of Zimbabweans who did not trust a party they saw as a proxy for Western interests. ""Democracy is sweet,"" Mawere said, ""and it is sour."""15-Mar-02,ZIMBABWE (98%); AFRICA (93%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%); NIGERIA (79%); SOUTHERN AFRICA (70%),"Leaning listlessly on the wall of a roadside gas station today, Sydney Gumbo and Nathan Mzumara tried to come to grips with the reelection of President Robert Mugabe. ""It's like being robbed,"" said Gumbo, 26, as he took one last drag from his cigarette. ""It's like being robbed in your own home,"" said Mzumara, 29. ""In broad daylight,"" said Gumbo. ""And being dragged outside and beaten,"" said Mzumara. ""With all your neighbors watching,"" said Gumbo. ""But when the police come, your neighbors say that you are to blame, not the man who has robbed and beaten you,"" said Mzumara. Gumbo nodded in agreement, the analogy complete. The two men were giving voice to a gut reaction widely shared in Zimbabwe one day after election officials announced that voters had overwhelmingly returned Mugabe, 78, to office for a fourth term. After a campaign characterized by state-sponsored violence and intimidation, and after preelection polls showed Mugabe trailing his opponent, many Zimbabweans -- and many Western governments and monitoring groups -- felt the way Gumbo and Mzumara did. Many of this country's neighbors in southern Africa, however, did not. ""It's just hard to believe,"" said Mzumara, tossing his cigarette into the dirt and stomping it as if in disgust, ""that the old man can just steal an election and all of Africa acts as if everything is okay. Why? Because he is an African hero from a war that was won a long time ago. Are the people in this country suffering because of him not Africans, too?"" In this town outside Harare -- Zimbabwe's capital and a stronghold of the losing opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) -- disbelief seems more prevalent than anger, lessening fears that Zimbabweans might revolt at the declaration of Mugabe as the winner of the country's most bitterly fought election since its independence from British rule in 1980. ""It is not just that they are like bandits, stealing an election from the people,"" said Justine Mafundikwa, a seamstress. ""But they rigged the vote so that it wasn't even close. ""They turned what should have been a landslide for [the MDC's presidential candidate Morgan] Tsvangirai into a landslide for Mugabe,"" she said of the announced results, which showed the incumbent winning by more than 400,000 votes. Election monitors from the Commonwealth nations today joined Western observers in denouncing the elections as deeply flawed. While the MDC and Mugabe's party were involved in political violence, said Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, the former military ruler of Nigeria who headed the Commonwealth observers here, ""it is our view that most of these were perpetrated by members/supporters of the ruling party against members/supporters of the opposition."" Abubakar also criticized the police for standing idly by when MDC members were being attacked but being ""high-handed"" when dealing with MDC supporters suspected of wrongdoing. The stark contrast between assessments by the Commonwealth and by many African observers -- Namibia, for example, said that procedures were so ""watertight"" as to make rigging impossible -- directed some voters' anger not just at Mugabe but also at the neighboring countries. ""What elections did they observe?"" Mafundikwa said testily. ""Are they blind? In the name of solidarity with their African brother Mugabe, they betray the rest of us who are hungry and without jobs and without money to even feed our children?"" Following a visit with Mugabe today, South African Deputy President Jacob Zuma told reporters that the elections were free and fair and that Mugabe should be recognized as the country's legitimate leader. A spokesman for President Thabo Mbeki said, however, that Mbeki was still contemplating his assessment. Farther afield, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi praised Mugabe's victory, and Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa said in a letter of congratulations that Mugabe's ""firmness was good for all of Africa."" President Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said today that such endorsements were troubling. ""From the president's point of view,"" he said, ""arguments that elections were flawed [but] are still acceptable send a negative signal to the rest of the world about African states' commitment to the rule of law and democracy."" In London, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said Britain would deny its former colony access to international funds. Economists and Western diplomats said Mugabe's reelection makes it likely that Zimbabwe's economic deterioration would continue.  Institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have already severed ties with the country. During the past two years, Mugabe has portrayed Tsvangirai as a puppet of the British and of whites eager to seize control of Zimbabwe after 22 years of black-majority rule. The rallying cry resonated with many of the country's neighbors, which also fought costly wars against colonial rule. But on the streets of Harare today, few seemed concerned with the threat of losing their sovereignty to whites. ""We won that war against the white settlers years ago,"" Gumbo said. ""It was Zimbabweans, South African, Nigerians, Namibians, our own black brothers who sold us out this time."""2-Jan-84,,"A Nigerian Army general announced today that he had assumed authority in the aftermath of the military overthrow of the country's civilian Government on Saturday. Speaking on a Nigerian radio broadcast monitored here, Maj. Gen. Mohammed Buhari said the new ''federal military Government'' had taken over ''to save this nation from imminent collapse.'' He said that Nigerians had been living under ''difficult and degrading conditions.'' The general, who served as Oil Minister in Nigeria in the 1970's and most recently commanded an armored division, said that ''after due consultation among the services of the armed forces,'' he had been ''formally invested with authority as the head of the federal military Government and the Commander in Chief of the armed forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.'' 'Call to National Duty' ''It is with humility and deep sense of responsibility that I accepted this challenge and call to national duty,'' he said. Another radio broadcast from Lagos, the Nigerian capital, monitored here, said that the country's military chiefs of staff and the inspector general of police had ''voluntarily resigned'' and that each of the country's 19 states would be under the control of a military governor.  ''Corrupt and inept leadership is the source of immorality and impropriety in our society,'' General Buhari said in his address. ''We shall remain here and salvage the country together,'' he declared. The general's radio speech was repeated at 30-minute intervals on the state radio network, with martial music interspersed. Since Saturday, when the elected Government of President Shehu Shagari was toppled, Nigeria's airports, seaports and border posts have been sealed, a curfew has been in effect and most telephone and telex communication has been cut off. Ban on Political Parties In earlier radio broadcasts that were monitored here, Brig. Saleh Abacha, commander of a mechanized infantry brigade near Lagos, announced suspension of Nigeria's four-year-old Constitution and the banning of all political parties. President Shagari was toppled two days after announcing an austerity budget that reflected the 50 percent drop in the nation's oil revenues since 1981. Nigeria is the second largest supplier of oil to the United States. The whereabouts of Mr. Shegari remained unknown, a Nigerian diplomat said here. Reports from Europe that he had been arrested could not be confirmed. Vice President Alex Ekwueme and several other members of the Shagari administration are reported to have been arrested and all officials of the former Government, both elected and appointed, ordered to report to the police. Diplomats who have managed to communicate with people in Nigeria say that the situation inside the country still appeared to be calm and that there have been no signs of resistance so far. But radio broadcasts have warned that anyone ''disturbing the peace'' would be ''summarily'' dealt with. The United States State Department said Saturday that it appeared that the 7,000 Americans known to be in the country were safe. The Nigerian press agency said that at Minna, in the central state of Kaduna, political party emblems were reported to have been torn down and ''persons unknown'' had burned pictures of the civilian governor, Alhaji Awwal Ibrahi. The agency said that truckloads of armed troops were patrolling Minna and that Governor Ibrahi had ''packed out'' - apparently disappeared - with his senior aides. President Shagari was elected to a second term in office last August. In the three months since his inauguration, he had selected a new Cabinet composed largely of technocrats and had promised to reduce the corruption and inefficiency that plagued his first administration. No New Plan for Recovery General Buhari said he intended to put an end to corruption and economic mismanagement but stated that the new military Government had no plan for a speedy financial recovery. He said that when the military gave up control in 1978 to allow a return to democratic rule, it did not realize that civilian politicians would go so far as to ''rig'' the August elections. The elections were widely hailed at the time as a triumph for democracy on a continent dotted with one-party nations. Some Westerners with long experience in Nigeria have expressed surprise at the timing of the coup. Speculation about the possibility of military intervention was rife during the summer's rough-and-tumble election campaign and again when there was a brief outbreak of violence after the announcement of election results accompanied by charges of electoral fraud. When no military intervention took place then, however, many analysts concluded that the military was willing to give Mr. Shagari time to attempt to make good on his campaign promises. The President, in presenting his new austerity budget and acting to reorganize the economy, indicated that, by and large, he would follow the prescriptions of such organizations as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. These included tighter controls on Government spending, encouragement of the agricultural sector and reduced dependence on oil, currently the source of more than 90 percent of Nigeria's income. However, Mr. Shagari resisted calls for a major devaluation of the naira, Nigeria's overvalued currency. Jurists' Group Deplores Coup GENEVA, Jan. 1 (Reuters) - The International Commission of Jurists today deplored the military coup in Nigeria and described Shehu Shagari, the ousted President, as a man universally respected for his integrity. The 30-year-old, Geneva-based body, which works to promote international observance of the rule of law and of human rights, called on the new administration of Maj. Gen. Mohammed Buhari to allow civilians to be tried by civilian courts and to permit freedom of speech, of the press and of trade union activity. ''The International Commission of Jurists deplores the military coup in Nigeria overthrowing a democratically elected Government, re-elected only a few months ago by a large majority and led by President Shagari, universally repected for his integrity,'' a statement issue by the organization said."18-Mar-90,,"Once the success story of West Africa, Ivory Coast is awash in debt, burdened by a bankrupt economy and governed by an octogenarian leader accused of corruption. Its long optimistic citizens fear their country may collapse, and diplomats worry that much of the region could be hurt in the wreckage. ""The old man,"" as President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, 84, is called, is outwardly unperturbed by angry street demonstrators who, for the first time in his half-century in politics, have accused him of corruption and demanded that he retire. The president, who has ruled since independence from France in 1960, told French reporters last week that he will soon designate an heir apparent but did not say he would share power with him. Houphouet-Boigny has rejected protesters' calls to abolish his one-party presidential system and allow a multi-party democracy. In the early years of independence, Ivory Coast economically outdistanced its richer neighbors, Ghana and Guinea, producing diversified cash crops ranging from coffee and cocoa to cotton, rubber, bananas and other tropical fruits. Modest amounts of oil were discovered. The country became the world's leading cocoa producer and the fourth largest coffee exporter. Millions of skilled and unskilled foreign workers -- accounting for perhaps half the country's 11 million population -- poured in to do farm work, drive taxis and run machines, and, over the years, their remittances have kept other millions afloat back home in Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal, Guinea, Liberia, Ghana and beyond. The prospect of Ivorian economic collapse, according to diplomats, economists and politicians, could set off a ripple effect with severe negative economic, social and political repercussions beyond Ivory Coast's borders. In retrospect, danger signals were flying by the late 1970s. Buoyed by high prices for coffee and cocoa, which accounted for more than half of Ivorian exports, giant state-dominated enterprises were founded, their rolls padded with extra workers -- university graduates and unskilled laborers alike -- to provide more jobs and prevent unemployment. On an optimistic evaluation of the economy, French and other Western banks lent Ivory Coast $ 10 billion. Foreign debt now totals $ 14.5 billion with arrears, since payments were stopped in 1987 because of steep, enduring plunges of world coffee and cocoa prices. Houphouet-Boigny cut farmers' guaranteed government payments for their crops by 50 percent in October. For two years, however, he had ignored calls to make such ""a brutal cut,"" as he called it last week, despite five years of overproduction. Similarly, the president until last month refused demands by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to cut the state budget by $ 450 million to obtain fresh loans. Bankers suggested he has compounded the economic crisis by such delaying tactics. For Ivorians, who are not used to economic hardship, the next three to five years are likely to be difficult, according to specialists. On Thursday, the government announced salary and benefits cuts of 8 to 17 percent for government workers earning more than $ 350 a month, 25 percent for legislators and 40 percent for cabinet ministers and presidents of state-owned companies. Private-sector workers will be forced to pay a ""solidarity tax"" of between 5 and 10 percent of their salaries. ""These measures have caused us much pain . . . . We cry with you in these sad and hard times,"" Houphouet-Boigny said in a televised address. ""But if we do not take these measures, in four or five months . . . we will not be able to pay salaries."" But critics of the president and his policies have charged that ""these sad and hard times"" were caused in part by official corruption and that a crackdown would reduce the sacrifice being asked of salaried workers. Computer printouts of 80,000 tax dodgers are said to be circulating in the Ivorian capital. Protesters have demanded that past and present government ministers return any ill-gotten gains, and Houphouet-Boigny himself has been the target of accusations. He is said to have spent $ 150 million on a Roman Catholic basilica in his hometown of Yamoussoukro, and to be harboring a fortune in overseas banks. Laurent Nbagbo, a university history researcher and longtime dissident, insists that Ivory Coast, despite its past success, ""is just another failed African country subject to nepotism and corruption shared with other one-party regimes. ""Only free, multi-party elections,"" he said in an interview, ""will provide the new legitimacy the country needs to solve the crisis."""26-Mar-90,,"Not since the early days of independence in the 1960s has French-speaking Africa experienced such buffeting, with anti-government demonstrations erupting recently in half a dozen capitals from Dakar on the continent's westernmost bulge to Libreville nearly 2,000 miles east on the equator. Single-party governments -- civilian or military, socialist or capitalist -- are paying the price of neglected agriculture, official corruption, failed economic development, runaway birth rates and rampant human-rights violations. Throughout French-speaking West Africa, long unchallenged administrations have fired ministers, be they scapegoats or scoundrels, and sought other ways to pacify populations who feel it is unfair that they, and not their leaders, are being asked to pay the price of their governments' failures. As the squeeze of austerity measures tightens, resentment is letting loose restiveness. The anti-government demonstrations in these sun-baked lands come in the shadow of changing Eastern Europe. Many young African protesters, inspired by television footage showing East European crowds demonstrating against communism, are seeking to emulate the success of Poles, Hungarians, East Germans, Czechoslovaks, Bulgarians and Romanians in shucking unpopular one-party governments and demanding multi-party democracy. In an interview, Laurent Nbagbo, a dissident and university professor, talked recently of the ills that afflict his native Ivory Coast, which he described as ""just another failed African country subject to nepotism and corruption shared with other one-party regimes."" While his remarks were aimed at Ivory Coast, their sentiments are echoed in other countries in West Africa, as is his prescription: ""Only free, multi-party elections will provide the new legitimacy the country needs to solve the crisis."" Just as the cry for change has been the same in these countries, so too has the government response: generally, a resounding ""no,"" reverberating through clouds of tear gas.In Gabon, President Omar Bongo clamped a curfew on the country's main oil town of Port-Gentil on Saturday night after rioting and looting erupted there. Gatherings of more than five people were also banned. The curfew was to continue yesterday. Since December, Bongo, who has ruled since 1967, has been confronted with strikes opposing austerity measures and student protests demanding political reforms. Government and bank employees went on strike and blocked roads last week in Libreville, the capital. The disturbances led Bongo in late February to rename his Democratic Party, and call a national conference to discuss political and economic changes. But opposition groups, who want multi-party democracy and more respect for individual freedoms, have complained about their representation at the conference. They are threatening to pull out of the talks and call a general strike if they are not allowed more delegates by Tuesday. In Ivory Coast, workers and students recently took to the streets in Abidjan, the capital, to demonstrate their anger at the government, which has demanded austerity but done nothing to punish an increasingly corrupt ruling elite. The protests were met by tear gas, stun grenades and truncheons. President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who has ruled since independence in 1960, has rejected protesters' demands for multi-party democracy. The opposition has accused Houphouet-Boigny and some of his powerful government ministers, past and present, of having hidden away in Europe sums said to exceed the foreign aid that Western donors have poured into Ivory Coast, long the showcase of free enterprise in Africa. In Niger, a poor landlocked state, security forces in the capital, Niamey, opened fire and killed at least 11 demonstrators who were protesting austerity measures that reduced scholarships and other subsidies for university students. Niger's president, Gen. Ali Saibou, last month blamed the disturbances on ""a small group of malcontents . . . plotting to destablize and throw [Niger] into chaos."" He promised a new constitution, but it would allow only one political party, he said. In Guinea, school teachers, once the vanguard of the radical revolution of late president Sekou Toure, recently went on strike in Conakry, the capital, for more pay from the military government of Gen. Lansana Conte, struggling to undo Toure's legacy of economic waste and realize the country's proven mineral and agricultural potential. In Benin, a tiny Marxist state, rioters late last month stoned a statue of Lenin in Porto Novo, the capital, and burned photos of President Mathieu Kerekou, who has been in power since 1972. After France withdrew budget support that had been buttressing bankrupt Benin, Kerekou renounced Marxism and called a national conference last month. But when delegates demanded that he resign, Kerekou burst into tears and accused them of ""attempting a civilian coup."" Now, former politicians long out of favor are sharing power with the president. In Senegal, whose capital, Dakar, once ruled over all French West Africa, cracked sidewalks and empty shops ring the imposing Place de l'Independance as visible reminders of the strain of maintaining post-imperial splendor at a time of growing political street violence. In these and other African countries, secondary and university students are leading the charge for change. Some African governments have spent impressive sums on education, but for many of the thousands of graduates, a diploma led only to a guaranteed civil service job, not to a desired position in the private sector. With the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund demanding that African governments cut back featherbedded payrolls in return for future aid, the young feel they have been educated for nothing. Said one Senegalese official: ""They've shown up for the formal ball just when the lights were being turned off. No wonder they blame those in place for stealing their future."" Tolerance of widespread human-rights violations is also wearing thin among a population sickened by routine police brutality, censorship and other restrictions on free expression. According to Amnesty International, the London-based human-rights monitoring group, human-rights abuses persisted in many of these countries in 1988, the last year for which reports were available. In Guinea, for example, there were a number of political arrests, and those detained were held incommunicado without charge or trial and reportedly subjected to frequent beatings, Amnesty said. In Benin, at least 80 prisoners of conscience remained in detention without trial and there were new arrests of nonviolent government critics. Political detainees were tortured and one died, apparently as a result, according to Amnesty. Adding to the travail of African governments is growing resentment among their educated citizens of corrupt politicians accused of having transferred into Swiss bank accounts or Paris property sizable proportions of French and other foreign aid meant for economic development. In a recent article in the Paris newspaper Le Monde, a specialist on French-speaking Africa asserted that in 1988 the Banque de France, which controls most central banks in the region, bought back $ 1.6 billion in banknotes, ""mostly smuggled out in suitcases and the diplomatic pouch,"" he said. ""Every franc we give impoverishes Africa, comes back to France, or is smuggled into Switzerland and even Japan,"" he wrote. For all these evils, multi-party democracy is being advanced by more and more people as the remedy, despite many African leaders' misgivings about what they claim is its inapplicability in societies with many tribes. In a multi-party democracy carried to the extreme, these one-party leaders argue, each tribe would create its own party. Adherents of this view point to Senegal, which has experimented with multi-party democracy for more than a decade, only to be plagued by a wave of often violent political demonstrations in the two years since President Abdou Diouf's reelection. But advocates of democracy note that before independence, French Africa had multi-party politics without drastic consequences."11-Jul-90,,"Hours after security forces routed rioters from the streets of this East African capital Monday night during a third day of civil turmoil, a ragged beggar on an otherwise deserted street repeatedly muttered, ""Nyayo! Nyayo! (Footsteps! Footsteps!)"" the slogan of President Daniel arap Moi's government. Throughout Kenya, the words evoke the aim of following the economic and political path charted by Kenya's founding father and first president, Jomo Kenyatta. But the footsteps here and elsewhere in Africa appear for the moment to be leading in the opposite direction -- down a new road, away from single-party states led by authoritarian rulers. The riots here and the violent clashes that occurred between police and protesters last month in Zambia reflect larger political and economic tensions on the continent as traditional leaders of sub-Saharan Africa struggle to contend with modern demands for change. ""This is not the only place in Africa where this is going on,"" said Smith Hempstone, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya. ""It may mean different things in different places. . . . Some of it seems to be a generalized protest over economic conditions. . . . Some may be a desire for reform of the existing government structure."" In Kenya, the struggle encompasses both. What began with the arrest of political opponents rapidly turned into riots by unemployed young men, many of whom seemed more interested in burning cars, robbing bystanders and throwing stones at police than in forming new political parties. The path of one-party rule blazed by Kenyatta now is accused by domestic and foreign critics of stifling dissent and political freedom. Amid charges of rampant corruption in Kenya's government, the nation is steadily losing foreign investors, and international aid donors have begun a review of some of the nearly $ 1 billion the nation receives each year. Moi's reaction to the criticism has been swift and predictable. Maintaining that single-party rule by the Kenya African National Union is here to stay, the Kenyan ruler ordered political dissidents and opponents jailed and accused foreign governments that expressed concern for human and civil rights here, particularly the United States, of meddling in the nation's affairs. Among those jailed were two former cabinet members, Kenneth Matiba and Charles Rubia. Today, the Moi government sent an even sharper signal when it announced that security forces have been ordered to ""use any force necessary"" to stifle the conflict, which has subsided in Nairobi but reportedly has spread to rural areas. The government reported that 15 people have been killed and 61 injured in violence Moi has attributed to ""hooligans"" and ""drug addicts."" But in a country of almost 24 million people, where unemployment among the young is more than 40 percent and the economy has grown 2.9 percent per year over the last decade while population has risen more than 4 percent annually -- a rate unsurpassed in the world -- popular discontent and desire for change are by no means unique to society's outcasts. Reacting to calls from foreign donors and domestic opponents for economic and political reform, a number of African countries in recent months have announced plans to move from single-party to multi-party political systems. Zaire, Benin, Gabon and Ivory Coast have been in the forefront of those countries promising change, but even impoverished Zambia and war-torn Angola and Somalia have declared their intent to take similar steps. Nigeria's military regime, despite a recent coup attempt, has also insisted that it will keep its promise to return power within two years to democratically elected civilian leaders. In some ways, the avowed changes reflect unlikely attempts by traditional autocratic rulers to fall in step and to compete with democratic transformations occurring elsewhere in the world that are influencing the policies and decisions of aid donors. At a time when democratic values are surging in popularity and the newly liberated nations of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union are beginning to attract increasing shares of the world's limited supply of economic development aid, many analysts feel Kenya's crackdown -- and others like it in Africa -- may be fraught with peril. Western lenders and institutions such as the World Bank, for instance, are emphasizing economic reform and political tolerance in Africa as conditions for assistance. The shift comes after a lost decade of development in the 1980s, when real income for most of the 450 million people of the continent declined. Somalia's longtime ruler, Mohamed Siad Barre, had little choice but to say the Somalia political system will change after donors led by the United States slashed more than $ 100 million in annual economic and military aid in response to widespread human rights abuses. But promising political change and delivering it are two different matters. Siad Barre still controls Somalia tightly and has announced no plans to give up power or to hold elections. Similarly, many political analysts and dissidents in Africa seem skeptical of the sincerity, willingness and ability of Zaire's Mobutu Sese Seko, Felix Houphouet-Boigny of Ivory Coast and Zambia's Kenneth Kaunda -- each of whom has ruled for more than a quarter-century -- to give up power or even allow real opposition. In Zambia, where Kaunda last month scheduled an October referendum for the people to decide whether they want more than one political party, many already have expressed skepticism about whether the poll will be fair. Kaunda has turned down demands by dissidents that the United Nations supervise the referendum. While opponents of single-party rule have been refused permission to campaign for the vote, Kaunda has recently taken to the stump to get out the single-party vote. When asked if he planned to vote in the referendum, one young Zambian man said no. ""I believe in multi-party,"" he said, insisting that the October vote will be rigged. The turmoil that has swept Africa suggests that when governments come to grips with the two-fisted demands for political and economic changes, the latter fist packs the bigger punch. Sharp increases in government spending and other austerity measures encouraged by foreign lenders and the International Monetary Fund have inspired protests, riots and strikes in numerous African countries. In Ivory Coast, Houphouet-Boigny was forced to consider political changes only when he was faced with a series of critical strikes by public service workers demanding back pay and wage increases. Likewise, Kaunda set the referendum date for multi-party rule only after demonstrators violently protested a doubling of the price of cornmeal by the government. The increase was part of a series of IMF-style economic reforms that included other austerity measures. However, Roger Chongwe, a Zambian human rights lawyer, mirrored the assessment of many advocates of political change in Lusaka when he described the food-price increases and the resulting riots that claimed at least 23 lives as ""a tragedy of one-party government."" ""We need to restructure the economy and make cuts in the budget, certainly,"" he said. ""But it was not accidental that these cuts were made in food subsidies and not in the public funds spent to support the ruling party."" Whether economic travail in Kenya will ever lead to political liberalization remains to be seen. But Moi is adamant in opposition to change. He has long insisted that political openness would inevitably lead to tribal factionalism, separatism and violence and ruin Kenya's stability. The consequences of such civil strife seem more than evident on the other coast of Africa, in Liberia, where tribal passions swirl amid that nation's bloody rebellion. But just as President Samuel K. Doe's decade of repression failed to stamp out simmering frictions between various ethnic groups in Liberia, Moi's brand of autocracy may similarly fail to bury cultural pluralism in Kenya or avoid its consequences."3-Oct-91,,"""If you want to steal, steal a little cleverly, in a nice way. Only if you steal so much as to become rich overnight, you will be caught."" Mobutu Sese Seko, criticizing corruption in Zaire, May 20, 1976 If the current political turmoil in Zaire should force longtime ruler Mobutu Sese Seko to flee his presidential mansion, he has plenty of other places to call home: a lavish townhouse in Paris, a 32-room estate in Switzerland and a 16th-century castle in Spain. Mobutu also should have no trouble paying for his departure. On past overseas trips, including official visits to Washington and a vacation in Disney World, he has often paid cash. When Mobutu made a brief stopover in Maine in 1987, for example, workers at the Bayview Inn in Bar Harbor watched one member of the Zairian entourage open a suitcase filled with cash and count out more than $ 50,000 to settle the bill, according to a spokeswoman for the inn. Over his 26 years in power, while his country sank deeper into poverty and despair, Mobutu has become one of the world's wealthiest foreign leaders, with holdings not only in prime real estate but also in Swiss bank accounts and, reportedly, shares of some European businesses. Forbes magazine has listed him as one of the world's richest dictators. A host of Zaire-watchers -- from diplomats to academics, from Zairian exiles to frequent critics on Capitol Hill -- is convinced that Mobutu has built that fortune by following his own advice to ""steal a little cleverly."" To his many critics, Mobutu ranks alongside Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and Haiti's Jean-Claude Duvalier as a longtime despot who looted his nation's treasury to amass millions -- by some accounts, billions -- abroad. And following a week of rioting across Zaire that has forced the regime to share power with the opposition for the first time, these critics are hoping that Mobutu -- like Duvalier and Marcos before him -- is also about to fall. On Sunday, Mobutu was forced to name longtime opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi as prime minister in a move that seemed to mark the first real diminution of Mobutu's power in 26 years. But the two men now appear locked in a power struggle, with Tshisekedi calling Mobutu ""a monster"" and insisting he must go, and Mobutu still trying to cling to his office even with his credibility shattered and large segments of his military in open revolt because of poor conditions and no pay. As the Zairian regime teeters, questions about Mobutu's wealth -- and how he obtained it -- become particularly intriguing, since for most of his rule he was the beneficiary of hundreds of millions of dollars in aid from Washington, where successive U.S. presidents have viewed him as a key African ally and anticommunist bulwark in a potentially unstable and inhospitable region. Mobutu came to power after a CIA-backed coup in 1965, following the assassination of nationalist leader Patrice Lumumba and a period of crisis and uncertainty in a country then seen as a flashpoint for Cold War confrontation in Africa. The opposition has made Mobutu's wealth one of its principal issues, and some anti-Mobutu Zairians have said they are determined to try to track down what they believe to be his plundered loot. For his part, Mobutu this week refused to answer opposition charges that he was ""a thief and a murderer,"" Reuter news agency reported from Kinshasa, the Zairian capital. ""History will judge me. . . . I shall remain silent,"" Mobutu told a group of supporters, according to Reuter. The exact size of Mobutu's fortune is not known. Past estimates, from Zairian exiles, journalists and U.S. congressmen, range as high as $ 5 billion, while some U.S. government officials place the figure much lower -- in the tens of millions of dollars. ""He has established a kleptocracy to end all kleptocracies, and has set a new standard by which all future international thieves will have to be measured,"" said Rep. Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Africa subcommittee, who has estimated Mobutu's wealth in the billions. ""He makes Marcos look like a piker by comparison."" Some U.S. diplomats with long experience in Zaire say that figure is greatly exaggerated -- ""ridiculous,"" said one State Department official -- and they place Mobutu's wealth at between $ 50 million and $ 125 million. ""He's spending, he's not saving,"" an American diplomat said. Mobutu's personal fortune may be reduced, said this diplomat and others, because of what they described as his practice of using money to buy off potential enemies. The diplomat and others said Mobutu buys villas for political rivals to co-opt them, awards trips to Europe as rewards and once imported 140 cars to use as ""gifts"" to university staffers who were complaining of low pay. ""Billions have been skimmed off, but it goes back to oil the machine,"" said a former CIA operative in Zaire who has kept business interests in the country. Mobutu, in a 1988 interview with Africa News, said his European bank accounts hold ""less than $ 50 million. What is that, after 22 years as head of state of such a big country?"" University of Wisconsin political scientist Crawford Young, a leading Zaire expert and author who has conducted extensive research into Mobutu's hidden wealth, said, ""I don't doubt that some of his [Mobutu's] money goes back into the economy. But to say he only has $ 50 million is absurd."" The Zairian Embassy here, contacted for this story, said the ambassador was out of town and unavailable to comment, and that the embassy had no spokesman. In Washington, Mobutu's most prominent supporter is international businessman Mamadi Diane, who describes himself as a friend of the Zairian president for the last nine years. Diane, in a telephone interview, said claims that Mobutu is a billionaire are exaggerated. ""People make a lot of allegations with no substantial proof,"" he said. ""Nobody has been able to pinpoint anything except the homes. We in the U.S. were also saying that the shah [of Iran] had all those billions, but nobody ever found them. . . . We haven't seen the billion dollars of Marcos, we haven't seen the billion dollars of [ousted Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio] Noriega. ""Mobutu, you have to say he has a very lavish lifestyle,"" Diane said. ""A very, very lavish lifestyle. He has a grand style of living. He lives like an African chief."" But Diane, too, said Mobutu gives away much of his money as a form of political largesse. ""All day long he is giving,"" Diane said. What is certain about Mobutu is that he has extensive real estate holdings. According to American diplomats, businessmen and members of Congress, Mobutu owns a 16th-century castle in Valencia, a luxurious townhouse on fashionable Avenue Foch in Paris, a 32-room residence in Lausanne, Switzerland, and estates in Italy, Portugal and several African capitals, including Abidjan, Ivory Coast, and Dakar, Senegal. Mobutu also constructed a massive palace near his birthplace in far-northeastern Zaire at Gbadolite -- ""a Versailles in the jungle,"" according to one Washington businessman who visited Mobutu there. A high-ranking Western diplomat who served in Zaire and visited the Gbadolite estate described it as ""a kind of emerald city of Oz,"" complete with illuminated fountains and grand marble buildings. To reach the nearly inaccessable spot, Mobutu constructed a four-lane highway. ""I guess he likes homes,"" said Diane. ""There isn't a single head of state in Africa who doesn't have three or four properties overseas."" Diane said even Mubutu's most vocal Zairian opponents maintain homes in Europe. Mobutu is also a big spender, particularly on his trips abroad. In the past, he has reportedly leased French Concordes for his trips, and his entourage usually includes about 100 aides. According to those who have handled past trips, one Mobutu aide is said to carry a suitcase filled with American dollars to settle hotel bills in cash. Mobutu also was criticized before the House Africa subcommittee in 1982 for using a Zairian government plane to fly a 100-member entourage to Florida for a Disney World vacation. The estimated cost, according to then-chairman Rep. Howard Wolpe (D-Mich.), was $ 2 million. It is unclear whether these trips were paid from Mobutu's own funds, Zairian government funds, or both. According to Zaire experts, the line between public and private funds often becomes murky when dealing with Mobutu. Mobutu's lavish lifestyle is shared by some other African leaders -- the so-called ""Big Men"" who rule through repression while erecting ostentatious edifices in their own name. The tragedy of Zaire, say Mobutu's many critics, is that a once wealthy country rich with natural resources is now one of Africa's economic basket cases, virtually cut off from outside aid and suffering chronic shortages of everything from food to fuel. Interviews with Zairian exiles, academics who specialize in Zaire, American diplomats, businessmen and journalists, and a former U.S. intelligence operative in Kinshasa reveal a complex longtime pattern in Mobutu's accumulation of wealth that includes: Direct rake-offs from state-owned copper, cobalt and diamond mines. The country's giant state copper mining firm, Gecamines, and the state diamond mining firm, MIBA (Miniere de Bakwanga), were described by almost all of the sources as Mobutu's principal ""cash cows."" One U.S. aid official said, ""It's corruption by taking revenues off the top of mineral resources."" Officials of both the World Bank and the U.S. Agency for International Development said that in 1988, about $ 400 million in revenues from Zaire's mineral exports disappeared and was never accounted for. Nguza Karl-I-Bond, a onetime prime minister under Mobutu who is now a key opposition leader, testified before a U.S. congressional subcommittee in 1981 that earlier that year about 20,000 tons of copper worth $ 35 million had been sold privately, with the proceeds to go directly to Mobutu. Karl-I-Bond also told Congress that he knew of chartered aircraft hauling Zairian cobalt and diamonds for sale in Europe, with the money to be directly deposited into Mobutu's personal accounts. Mobutu's direct control over Zaire's budget and central bank. This power has allowed him to divert hundreds of millions of dollars to his personal accounts or to the office of the president with a simple telephone call, U.S. diplomats and academics and Zairian exiles say. In 1979, a Zairian parliamentary commission openly accused Mobutu of illegally withdrawing Bank of Zaire funds for his own use over a two-year period. Later, in 1981, opposition leader Karl-I-Bond told the U.S. congressional subcommittee that Mobutu had recently ordered the bank to transfer $ 30 million to his personal bank account abroad. Kickbacks from private businesses to Mobutu's circle. A Western diplomat who has served often in Zaire, once as ambassador, said, ""Any business activity there has to include a percentage for the president."" Awarding of official contracts to cronies and family members. One of the main beneficiaries was Mobutu's late cousin, Litho Maboti -- known in Zaire as ""Uncle Litho"" -- who was able to use Mobutu's sweeping nationalization order of Nov. 30, 1973, called Zairianization, to build up a vast commercial and agricultural empire. One knowledgeable source, citing U.S. intelligence reports, said that when he died sometime in the 1980s, Litho was known to have about $ 1 billion in a Swiss bank account, but that could not be independently confirmed. Mobutu also owns extensive land inside his country, accumulating a vast agricultural empire of coffee, tea and rubber plantations after expropriating the lands from their foreign owners under his 1973 Zairianization decree. Many of the seized lands were grouped together and managed under the Mobutu-owned conglomorate known as CELZA (Cultures et Elevages du Zaire). Political scientist Young, in his 1985 book, ""The Rise and Decline of the Zairian State,"" listed 14 plantations under CELZA employing some 25,000 workers -- making it by 1977 the third-largest employer in the country. Citing U.S. Agriculture Department statistics, Young showed that CELZA-run plantations accounted for 23 percent of Zaire's cocoa bean production, 26 percent of its rubber and 15 percent of its tea. According to Young, Mobutu also became the largest shareholder in the Banque du Kinshasa, where all state firms kept their accounts, as well as aquiring ""indirect interests in the Zairian operations of ITT-Bell, Fiat, Gulf, Pan Am, Renault, Peugeot, Volkswagen and Unilever."" One example of Mobutu's penchant for setting up dummy companies for profit involves the Panamanian-registered firm Risnelia, which underwrote the gate for the 1974 heavyweight championship bout between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman -- the ""Rumble in the Jungle."" According to Zaire scholar Stephen R. Weissman, in a 1974 article in the Nation magazine, the Risnelia company was wholly owned by Mobutu, who took personal control of the fight receipts. According to Weissman, who interviewed the chairman of Risnelia, the Zairian government paid for the promotion of the fight with public funds, while Mobutu, through the office of the president, was estimated to take 42.5 percent of the fight's gross world receipts."31-Jul-92,,"Finally, the campaigning. President Daniel arap Moi arrived, waving to the crowd from the open sunroof of his Mercedes-Benz stretch limousine and clutching the baton that has become his trademark. It was the first stop on a two-day tour of Kenya's western districts for Moi and his Kenya African National Union, or KANU. Moi accepted flowers from a little girl, tried on a KANU baseball cap and listened intently while a girls' choir sang his praises with the upbeat refrain: ""President Moi, carry on leading our nation . . . because your leadership is second to none!"" Moi has ruled for 14 years. He only recently and reluctantly embraced multi-party politics, and he still has not set a date for the elections.  But while much of the anti-government press in Nairobi has already written his political obituary, a day with Moi on the trail suggests that his campaign for a new five-year term may prove him to be a far more formidable incumbent to unseat than fellow autocrats who have fallen from power recently in the continent's turn to democracy. Just nine months ago, Moi staunchly defended his one-party rule as he jailed oppositionists, sent truncheon-wielding police to break up anti-government rallies, and declared defiantly that he would crush his opponents ""like rats."" But that was before the World Bank in November suspended aid pending Kenyan steps to curb widespread corruption and to revive trampled political liberties and human rights. Since the aid cutoff, Moi has done an about-face, calling for an end to his party's constitutional monopoly on power and declaring that he was ready to take on the opposition at the ballot box. Whether the upcoming elections will be free and fair is still open to question -- and reports of police intimidation of opposition politicians and their supporters have raised doubts among some foreign diplomats. Clearly, Moi does not intend to go the way of Zambian ex-president Kenneth Kaunda, another reluctant convert to multi-party rule, who waged a lackluster campaign and was defeated in elections last October. ""It sounds to me like Moi's doing some very good stumping -- better than anyone in the opposition,"" said a Western diplomat in Nairobi. ""Things are very much stacked in KANU's favor, and in Moi's favor. . . . I don't see anybody who's got the popularity and the nationwide base that Moi does."" Moi's speeches to the rallies on Monday here in Migori and at other stops indicated the lines Moi will take for the elections now widely expected this fall -- that KANU, under Moi, has delivered the goods, that civil servants are duty-bound to support the government, and that the opposition is tribalist and seeks to divide the country into feuding ethnic groups. ""KANU will win the coming election,"" Moi told the crowd here in Swahili. It ""is not a tribal organization. It is a nationalist organization."" He said civil servants ""should serve the government of the day,"" and KANU, as the ruling party, is the government. And in his only blatantly personal attack, he called one opposition leader a ""racist"" for trying to stir up animosities between indigenous Africans and the minority Asian community. In recent weeks, Moi has managed to buttress his attacks on the opposition with largess, granting land titles to squatter families in rural areas. And the government-organized rallies have turned into forums for rural residents to present grievances. A man with mangled legs tried to shout to Moi from below the stage, but guards quickly hustled him away. But as Moi was about to leave, he asked, ""Where is that man?"" and aides produced him. Moi listened intently and nodded as the man described how he had no farm and no livelihood and needed money to start a business, and the president told him, ""I'll look into your request."" At a later stop in Kehancha, close to the Tanzanian border, schoolchildren singing for Moi ended their song with a plea for the town, saying it needed water facilities, a doctor and a new bus. Moi instructed the Ministry for Water Development to dig a new well, and a doctor was posted there the following day. Moi also said he would ask friends to donate money to buy a bus. KANU ""can win with Moi because people still hold him in high esteem,"" a Western embassy official here said. ""He's done a lot of good things."" Scenes of Moi jovially glad-handing among the common people, and receiving the accolades of well-orchestrated, pro-government crowds, contrasted sharply with the view this week from an opposition camp. It is in disarray, torn by the competing egos and ambitions of its most prominent leaders. Four officials of the largest opposition party, the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy, have announced their intention to run for the presidency against Moi, and this week they split into rival factions that have engaged in bitter name-calling and charges of vote-rigging in party elections. The forum has sought to present a credible alternative to KANU. Its four presidential aspirants are interim chairman and octogenarian Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, former cabinet minister and onetime exile Kenneth Matiba, populist Martin Shikuku and reclusive Masinde Muliro. Feuding began in May, when Matiba returned from his London exile to announce his intention to run for president after first challenging Odinga for the forum chairmanship. Since then, Matiba has been accused of using ""lone-ranger tactics,"" in the words of one forum official. Recently Matiba was accused of having printed 1 million false party membership cards in a bid to rig voting for party offices. Forum Executive Director Peter Anyang' Nyong'o took the unusual step of filing suit against Matiba over the cards. The debate now has turned to whether internal party elections are needed. The disarray, with national elections looming possibly as early as October, seems to improve the prospects of Moi -- who was being written off politically last year when he was forced by aid donors to lift the ruling party's constitutional monopoly on power. ""We're playing into his hands,"" conceded lawyer James Orengo, another forum activist. He said the party still enjoyed sufficient grass-roots support for victory ""if only we can get our house in order."" A Western diplomat, speaking of the opposition, said: ""These people are not running for election as much as they're running against KANU. They're not for anything."" Many observers have raised the prospect of a divided vote -- Moi winning reelection while the forum takes control of the National Assembly. That possibility appears to be behind a recent KANU proposal to amend the constitution to require that the winner of the presidential election choose a government from his own party, even if his party fails to win a majority of the legislative seats."10-Jul-94,,"The once elegant, European-style boulevards of this capital are overrun with debris. Largely abandoned government buildings are obscured behind elephant grass and overgrown trees. In a perverse reversal of the usual development maxim, an opulent colonial capital is being overtaken by the bush. Kinshasa was carved out of the jungle. Now the jungle is coming to claim the land back. As sub-Saharan Africa struggles to find stability in the 1990s, Zaire offers a poignant -- and ominous -- lesson. Unlike Somalia and Liberia, this big, rich country has not collapsed into civil war. It has not, like tiny Rwanda, imploded after a brutal campaign of tribal slaughter. But Zaire, the region's second-largest country and one of its potentially wealthiest, is equally desperate: It has crumbled from official corruption and greed, incompetence, neglect and decay. The institutions that once defined the Zairian state have all ceased to function. Civil servants and teachers are not paid, roads and bridges are left in disrepair, public hospitals are not supplied, the public telephone system has disintegrated. Child malnutrition is on the rise, and the country is ravaged by AIDS and a rebirth of sleeping sickness that has caused entire villages simply to lie down and die. ""Precolonial"" is how one Western resident described Zaire. ""It's like Europe in the Dark Ages,"" said another Westerner, a diplomat with long experience here. ""Zaire just proves that societies don't depend on the existence of a state. Societies can function on their own."" While the causes of Zaire's crisis may be distinct -- and the extent of its free fall extreme -- this country in many ways stands as a microcosm of what many Africans and others say is a continent-wide phenomenon. Since the United States and the Soviet Union ended a rivalry that shaped the politics of sub-Saharan Africa through much of the last 30 years, the region has struggled to find a new basis for stability and development free of foreign tutelage. Some progress has been made. But governments, economies and even whole countries artificially forged by European colonizers in the 19th century, and propped up since achieving independence a generation ago by the patronage of outside powers, are beginning to fragment. Like most countries of the developing world, and in the former communist bloc of Eastern Europe, African states have tried to adopt the non-communist world's formula for success. Most have pledged to open their economies and adopt free-market policies, and many have begun talking about giving up autocracy or one-party rule for democracy and pluralism. A few -- most famously South Africa -- have succeeded. Yet as much of the rest of the Third World appears poised to enter a new era of rapid economic growth and stability, Africa is still struggling to shake off the burdens of the past, ranging from the borders drawn by the European powers to the corruption and economic mismanagement engendered by post-colonial dictators backed by Moscow, Washington, Paris or Beijing. In many places, the old order is crumbling but nothing is taking its place. ""There's too much talk about development and not enough about decay,"" said Peter Lyon at London's Institute for Commonwealth Studies. Zaire, he said, ""may be the classic case.""  Obstacles Old and New For two years, Zaire for all practical purposes has had no working government. Its longtime president, Mobutu Sese Seko, has been abandoned by the United States, his backer during the Cold War, and no longer can impose order on his sprawling country. But his political opponents have been too weak to remove him. There are two competing prime ministers, neither of whose authority is accepted by the army or the bureaucracy. Soldiers have destroyed much of the infrastructure of the capital in riots over pay, and whole regions populated by distinct ethnic groups have simply taken over their own affairs. For some Africans, the crisis reflects fundamental problems of statehood that have lingered in African countries since they gained independence in the 1960s. ""It raises profound questions about the nature of these governments and the nature of these states,"" said Rakiya Omaar, a Somali who is co-director of African Rights, a London-based human rights group. ""The problem in Africa has been these predatory, strong central governments that never cared about their own people."" Similar political breakdowns are happening around the region. Somalia has not had a government since its U.S.-backed dictator, Mohamed Siad Barre, was chased out of power in January 1991. Liberia is still in the throes of an on-again, off-again civil war over who, and what, should replace the late Samuel Doe's dictatorship. Angola and Sudan both seem hopelessly locked in civil wars that have effectively divided those countries along geographic lines. And Rwanda, Zaire's neighbor, has been in a state of anarchy and civil war since April 6, with no effective government in place, since President Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in an unexplained plane crash. Other countries, from Sierra Leone to Uganda, from Ethiopia to Mali, are waging small-scale wars against guerrillas, ethnic separatists or armed bandits that have made large chunks of territory impassable and lawless. One key cause of this turmoil is Africa's loss of what was arguably its most important resource: its relevance. During the Cold War, the continent was a playground for the proxy conflicts. The Americans, the Soviets, the Chinese, the Israelis, the Arabs, white South Africans, white Rhodesians, even the Taiwanese searched for allies and brought in aid, arms and advice. Much of the attention lavished on Africa proved destructive -- fueling civil wars, as in Angola, or backing dictators, as in Somalia, Liberia and Zaire. But the outside attention also meant that highways were built, hospitals were kept supplied and a generation of Africa's elite were given access to education at home and abroad. African autocrats were able to play East against West, Arabs against Israelis, Chinese against Taiwanese in a bid for foreign largesse. The game was always to find who would give the most aid, and some despots played it deftly. With the end of the East-West conflict, the dismantling of South Africa's racist policies of apartheid and the move toward peace in the Middle East, Africa has become more marginalized than at any time since Europeans first set foot here 500 years ago. Zaire tells the story: After years in which the United States, France and Belgium lavished aid on Mobutu, almost all foreign assistance has been cut since 1990, and most expatriate workers have departed. In June, Zaire was expelled from the International Monetary Fund. The lack of foreign interest and investment, combined with the difficulty of implementing new economic and political models, means that even outside war zones, Africans are struggling to come to terms with longstanding social and economic ailments: # According to the World Bank, the four poorest countries in the world, in terms of gross national product, are in Africa; seven of the world's 10 poorest countries are in Africa. From 1980 until 1991, African economies actually shrank an average of 1.2 percent each year, meaning Africans have gotten poorer over the last decade. # African countries have the world's highest illiteracy rates, and they put the least public money per pupil into their education systems. # Agricultural production has declined in most African countries over the last two decades, leaving Africa less able to feed itself and more dependent on foreign food aid. The World Bank estimates it will take 40 years for some African countries just to climb back to their pre-independence level. # Africa is ravaged by disease. AIDS has become the most common cause of death for Africans, and in a dozen African cities, 20 to 30 percent of the adult population is infected with the virus that causes AIDS. More than 10 million of the world's 15 million people infected with the AIDS virus are in Africa. Not all African countries are in a downward spiral. While Angola is in the grip of full-scale civil war, Malawi recently conducted a peaceful election that ousted an entrenched autocrat. The death of the president of Rwanda sparked an explosion of tribal massacres, but the death of the president of Ivory Coast caused barely a political ripple. There are many economic problem areas, but some countries, like Ghana, are on the mend. Still, it is the absence of outright conflict in most African countries that makes their social and economic decline so remarkable. In state after state, public institutions have collapsed, health care has diminished, infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and poverty has deepened -- not because of civil war, but simply because poorly supported, inefficient and sometimes corrupt governments have been unable to manage their countries' daunting problems. In other words, the pattern in Zaire may not be the exception but the rule. ""In Somalia and Liberia, it was violent,"" said a European diplomat in Zaire. ""Here, it's a slow implosion. But the result is the same. Here, it's just crumbled."" The Road to Anarchy Although its descent into near-anarchy was touched off by the end of the Cold War, Zaire's deterioration as a state began shortly after the country gained independence from Belgium in June 1960. An early secessionist movement in the region of Katanga, which provoked U.N. troops to intervene, underscored the fragility -- and artificiality -- of the new nation of 200 separate tribes. Still, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Zaire -- then known as the Congo -- provided Western countries with 69 percent of their industrial diamonds, 49 percent of their cobalt, and other strategic minerals, making it ""a very important piece of real estate,"" according to American University's Sanford J. Ungar in his book, ""Africa."" From that commanding position as a wealthy and strategically important Western supplier, the country entered a long era of Western-backed autocratic rule -- and slow decline. In 1965, army strongman Joseph Desire Mobutu seized power, changing his name and that of his country in an ""Africanization"" campaign. Mobutu personifies the African Big Man, the old-style and outdated autocrat who rules more like a traditional tribal chieftain. Over almost three decades with Mobutu at the helm, Zaire suffered from extraordinary mismanagement and corruption. Hundreds of millions of dollars of export earnings from state-run mining corporations literally disappeared -- presumably into the overseas bank accounts of Mobutu and his family members, and also to support the lavish but unaccounted-for spending projects of the office of the presidency. Mobutu's well-documented corruption and his heavy-handedness with opponents brought frequent rebukes from Washington and his European patrons. But from the first Congo crisis of the Kennedy administration, which saw Africa becoming a battleground between East and West, Mobutu proved a valuable Cold War ally to the United States. And Washington's financial and political support kept Mobutu in power. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the withdrawal of Cuban troops from neighboring Angola, however, the United States no longer had a strategic interest in propping up Zaire's dictator. And like Zambia's Kenneth Kaunda, Kenya's Daniel arap Moi and Malawi's H. Kamuzu Banda, Mobutu was forced to relent to mounting pressure for change. Zaire for a time looked as if it might be on the path to pluralism. In 1992, a national conference stripped Mobutu of much of his power, appointed staunch Mobutu opponent Etienne Tshisekedi as prime minister and even changed the country's name back to Congo in a direct slap at Mobutu. The conference -- made up of politicians, civic leaders, intellectuals and clerics -- voted to make all of its decisions binding and replaced the old Mobutu-dominated parliament as the supreme lawmaking body. What the conferees apparently never counted on was that Mobutu would simply ignore their edicts and continue to govern as he pleased, keeping personal control of the nation's money supply through the central bank and using freshly minted cash to keep his elite presidential guard paid and loyal. What has developed over the last two years has been a kind of bizarre shadow play. Mobutu ""fired"" Tshisekedi as prime minister, then concocted a new convention to choose a replacement, Faustin Birindwa, a Mobutu ally. But Tshisekedi refused to relinquish his title, giving the country two claimants to the position, neither of whom has any resources or real power. Government offices shut their doors, unable to function without cash. Cabinet ministers stayed home. The country ground slowly to a halt. With the country sinking into ruin, weary national conference delegates -- their numbers now swollen with Mobutu supporters -- voted in June for yet another prime minister, Kengo wa Dondo, who had more legitimate anti-Mobutu credentials but still was rejected by some elements of the opposition. Various Western embassies tried to persuade Tshisekedi and his rivals to unify, but to no avail. The latest convention has promised presidential elections next year. Many Zairians and Western diplomats predict that, with the opposition divided and squabbling, Mobutu will likely win, whether he rigs the elections or not. And that, they say, is a likely formula for continued national stagnation and disintegration. ""Things are getting worse and worse,"" said Eugene Nzila, a physician whose AIDS research project has crumbled to virtually nothing because the country's continuing paralysis forced foreign donors to withdraw funding. ""It's basically a political situation,"" he said, reflecting the frustration of many Zairians. ""There's nothing we can do but wait.""  Surviving by Skimming If Zaire can be seen as a microcosm of Africa, then Ndili International Airport might be seen as a microcosm of Zaire. Upon arriving at the airport, a passenger is immediately greeted by a dizzying array of soldiers and police, hustlers, deal makers, facilitators, money changers, customs inspectors, health inspectors, drivers, shoeshine boys, baggage handlers and just plain hangers-on. Each claims to have some official service to perform -- checking your vaccination card, searching your luggage -- and each demands to be paid ""service"" -- a price that can range anywhere from a few pennies in local currency to $ 20. Official services at the airport have broken down; no one has gotten a paycheck in at least six months. But working at the airport can still prove lucrative for the amount of money that can be extorted or raked off from incoming passengers. There is much jostling, shouting and occasional shoving as everyone takes a turn to perform his task and demand his fee. To cut more easily through the crowd, there are ""facilitators."" Most are uniformed soldiers -- ostensibly, assigned to airport security, in reality soldiers-for-hire. One will attach himself to a passenger, according VIP status; help push through to the front of lines; find the passenger a taxi; even accompany the passenger for the 20-mile trip into town ""for security."" The price: $ 100 all-inclusive, including cab fare. ""You can pay the colonel, you can pay the soldiers,"" said a European diplomat. ""And it's a good thing. Those guys are being fed. They sleep well, they eat well, their families are fed."" That kind of chaotic, anything-goes corruption is more evident the farther one ventures from Kinshasa, as the ""privatization"" of government services and the irrelevance of the central government become even more pronounced. The small border outpost of Uvira, on Zaire's eastern border with Burundi, is about as far from Kinshasa as possible, in every way. The border post still has immigration controls, customs controls, police controls and every other conceivable type of government authority. But the corruption -- if it can still be called that in a place with no official rules -- has become a means of survival for public servants with no other means of income except whatever can be extorted from travelers. Thus, there is the $ 20 fee for each person crossing the border, plus an extra $ 20 for each car. There is a Transportation Ministry desk that charges a $ 10 ""tax"" for use of the road. The Health Ministry charges $ 20 -- or whatever can be negotiated -- as its price of entrance. And there are the police manning roadblocks along the way out of town, also demanding ""service"" to allow passage. By becoming more or less financially self-sufficient, such isolated east Zairian towns have maintained some semblance of public order -- while at the same time becoming less tied to Kinshasa. In Goma, for example, local merchants have joined together to make sure the military is kept paid, preventing the kind of bloody soldier riots that wracked Kinshasa in 1991 and 1993. ""It's all localized,"" said a diplomat, using the analogy of Europe's Dark Ages. ""Think of it as castles along the Rhine in the year 900, where everyone exacted a tax or toll."" This kind of de facto decentralization -- growing regional autonomy and independence -- is in evidence elsewhere, an outgrowth not of any planned attempts to disperse power but rather the natural evolution of weak central governments that can no longer provide needed services to their outlying areas. In war-torn Angola, Somalia and Liberia, central governments can no longer claim to control much beyond their capitals. In large countries such as Nigeria and Ethiopia, government edicts are becoming less relevant. Even relatively stable Tanzania is now having to deal with growing calls for independence from the island of Zanzibar, which is finding union with the mainland irrelevant. ""These countries are artificial,"" said Michael Chege, a Kenyan scholar at Harvard University. ""They have to be. What else do you do, with all these tribes and linguistic groups and so on? ... We might have to consider adjusting boundaries -- or at least put it on the agenda."" About The Series With the end of the Cold War, sub-Saharan Africa ceased to be the prize for which East and West had vied over decades. In the 1990s, the region's 45 governments are trying to make their own way in a changing world, grappling with new political and economic systems that are often at odds with centuries-old traditions and decades-old practices. This occasional series on a continent adrift will look at African successes and failures and their causes. Future stories will address such issues as environmental degradation, economics, health, religion, population growth, ethnic differences and Africa's role in the world."2-Jan-95,,"All across Africa, dictators, military men and traditional autocrats are showing their resiliency as democratic movements fade, and Western aid donors seem willing to accept economic modernization -- without political reform -- as sufficient reason to continue the flow of funds. Democracy has begun to take root and flourish elsewhere around the world -- in Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia. But Africa in many ways seems to defy the trend, despite a few successful democratic transitions. Africa's traditional dictators and tribal chieftains -- the ""Big Men"" -- have proven surprisingly tenacious. And with Western and American interest in Africa waning, the Big Men are finding it easier to pursue their policies of political repression free from foreign pressures to reform. As a result, the democratic tide that appeared poised to sweep the continent at the start of the 1990s has stalled in some places and been turned back in others. Obdurate dictators cling to power in Zaire, Cameroon and Gabon. Soldiers have consolidated their grip in Sierra Leone and Africa's most populous country, Nigeria. Moreover, Africa's democrats feel they have been abandoned by their onetime allies in the West, who once insisted on serious moves toward democracy before authorizing aid, but who seem to be accepting merely cosmetic changes implemented by authoritarian rulers. There have been a few noteworthy successes, particularly in South Africa, where Nelson Mandela became president last April following the country's first national election in which the black majority was allowed to participate. Elections in Malawi in May ousted Africa's longest-serving dictator, H. Kamuzu Banda, while balloting last October in Mozambique completed a U.N.-brokered peace process to end a 16-year civil war. But ethnic slaughter in Rwanda, renewed anarchy in Somalia and seemingly intractable civil war in Sudan, Liberia and Angola have raised the possibility that Africa's future will bring the descent of other nations into perpetual conflict, with the outside world unable to prevent it. Even some of those considered bright rising stars in the continent's political firmament have disappointed reform advocates. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni had emerged as the darling of the World Bank and Western embassies for ushering in a prolonged period of political stability following the dictatorships of Idi Amin and Milton Obote, but Museveni has shown he is no democrat. He brooks no talk of pluralism in a Uganda he essentially runs in autocratic fashion. In Zambia, Frederick Chiluba was seen three years ago as the harbinger of Africa's new democratic trend when he defeated longtime president Kenneth Kaunda in that country's first multi-party elections. But Chiluba presides over a government widely considered corrupt and incompetent. Allegations of drug-dealing have surrounded high-level officials, and Chiluba's party has been plagued by the resignations of many of its reform advocates, who say the president has lost his direction. ""The war against dictatorships has hardly been won,"" Kenyan scholar Michael Chege, now at Harvard University, wrote in Current History magazine earlier this year. In countries such as Cameroon, Kenya, Togo, Gabon and Sudan, wrote Chege, ""the heads of government have clung to power through a combination of brute force, manipulation of gullible opposition parties, bribery, crafty exploitation of ethnic loyalties and cosmetic constitutional reforms to appease Western donors who demand 'good governance' as a precondition for further development aid."" For a time, it looked as if Western donors, particularly the United States, would insist on political and economic reform as a condition for granting the aid that props up Africa's autocrats. At the start of the decade, terms such as ""good governance,"" ""democratization"" and ""transparency"" set the criteria for determining which African states would qualify for continued international largess. In late 1991, Kenya's aid was suspended pending economic reforms and a shift to political pluralism. Malawi later suffered a similar aid cutoff that forced longtime dictator Banda to call the multi-party election that were his undoing. But Africa's strongmen have proven adept at creating the facade of reform without genuine change. Elections are called, then hijacked. Opposition political parties are legalized, but those who join them are harassed. Voting districts are gerrymandered to favor ruling cliques. Economic reforms are announced with great fanfare but delayed or blocked in implementation. And for the most part, Western aid keeps flowing. ""There was this rush of goodwill towards democratic movements in Africa,"" said Makau wa Mutua, a Kenyan who heads the Harvard Law School's human rights project. ""That has fizzled now. The impatience of the West with what it takes to create a democratic regime in countries that have been ruled by despots for centuries is now evident. ... There may have been a failure to recognize that democracy is a process and not an event. To reverse despotism will take a lot of hard work."" ""It's now open season on democracy movements in Africa once again,"" Mutua said. ""Governments feel free to harass and muzzle the opposition."" Nowhere were the expectations higher -- and the disappointment more profound -- than in Kenya, where President Daniel arap Moi continues to cling to power in the grand style of the Big Man. Three years ago, with his aid suspended and the opposition Forum for the Restoration of Democracy defying his ban on public rallies, Moi's regime appeared on verge of collapse. But last month, aid donors meeting in Paris pledged $ 800 million in assistance, giving a stamp of approval to Moi's cash-strapped government. The donors said they were responding to Moi's serious economic reforms -- including liberalization of exchange regulations, a lowering of some tariffs and an easing of price controls. Yet, corruption involving high government officials has continued unchecked, often exposed in the local press. Anti-government critics are harassed through the courts. Opposition politicians are routinely denied licenses to hold rallies or public meetings. And local elections continue to be marred by accusations of vote-buying and intimidation. ""It is clear that Kenya is moving inexorably back to a one-party state,"" the Washington-based International Republican Institute warned in a September report. ""Hope for the progress of pluralist democracy in Kenya is fading fast."" Human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch/Africa, have criticized the Moi government's record and its use of the courts to harass and silence its critics. One of the most prominent political prisoners is a former member of Parliament, Koigi wa Wamwere, who is being tried for allegedly raiding a police station to steal guns in November 1993. The government's case against him has been discredited repeatedly in court testimony, including sworn forensic evidence that one of Wamwere's supposed victims killed in the foiled raid actually died several days before the incident. Moi won an election in December 1992 that was widely considered flawed by foreign observers and that followed a year during which tribal clashes, allegedly instigated by the government, claimed hundreds of lives and left thousands homeless. Since then, Moi has cracked down on those who opposed him. The most critical anti-government magazines have been shut down, harassed by police or driven into bankruptcy by repeated confiscation of their issues. One newspaper editor, Bedan Mbugua of the weekly People, served months in jail under harsh conditions after printing a a story that questioned the impartiality of the judiciary. Moi has gotten away with it, his critics say, because the 1992 election, despite its flaws and reported irregularities, accorded him a kind of legitimacy that had waned during the previous years of criticism of his anti-government practices. That election ""did more harm, because it legitimized him and gave him a fresh lease on life, thereby making it more difficult to insist on political reform,"" said Paul Muite, an opposition member of Parliament. Muite said the opposition's main mistake was to agree to go ahead with elections before insisting on a revision of the constitution, including changes to limit the president's power, to repeal sedition laws and to allow honest competition for radio and television air time. And the U.S. Embassy here -- once at the forefront of the push for democratic change under outspoken Ambassador Smith Hempstone -- has done an about-face under the new ambassador, Aurelia E. Brazeal. Whereas Hempstone was often bombastic in his criticism of the Kenyan government, Brazeal has adopted what appears to be a more conciliatory approach, praising the changes that have occurred in the apparent hope of encouraging more. Gitobu Imanyara, a human rights lawyer and frequent critic of the government, said the new ambassador's posture was disappointing. ""It will not be long before you hear Kenyans issuing statements against the embassy here,"" he said. Muite was also critical of Brazeal, saying, ""I don't think she understands the Kenyan situation whatsoever."" The U.S. Embassy, he said, ""is now irrelevant to the democratization struggle here."""9-Apr-95,,"There has never been a war between Ghana and Burkina Faso, but anyone trying to get from the capital of one of these West African neighbors to the capital of the other could be excused for thinking otherwise. Both countries have national airlines with their own regional routes, yet there are no flights between them. Large numbers of Burkinabe have long lived in Ghana, and yet the main road linking the two countries is so strewn with potholes that, according to a local joke, the only drivers seen traveling in straight lines on the highway are drunks. As if the deeply cratered highway were not bad enough, on one recent 600-mile drive from Ouagadougou to Accra, there were no fewer than 30 police and customs checks. Those who regularly brave the route, from the desolate millet-planted plains in the north to the cocoa farms and hilly tropical forests that announce the approach of the coast, say they are routinely held up for bribes or forced at each stop to surrender portions of their belongings. The effect of obstacles like these -- legacies of different colonial heritages, of development policies that have essentially ignored opportunities for cross-border cooperation and of widespread corruption -- is readily evident. Even in broad daylight, 20 minutes or more often passes between vehicles crossing the border into Burkina Faso at the edge of this town. While other parts of the world are forming new alliances, especially for commercial purposes, international economists and business leaders from the region say English-speaking Ghana and two French-speaking neighbors, Burkina Faso and the Ivory Coast, exemplify how Africa's fragmentation remains a fundamental stumbling block to developing the world's poorest continent. Together, the three countries form what many experts consider a natural economic unit whose market, with a total population of nearly 40 million, would begin to make it inviting to foreign investors. Separately, however, even though they can currently boast the region's three best-performing economies, they remain small, poor and isolated markets in which the potential reward for outside investors often seems too small to justify the perceived risks of doing business in Africa. Like the rest of the continent, West Africa already has several regional organizations, but in contrast to other regions, from North and South America to the Caribbean and Europe, groups here have achieved little in the way of dropping barriers to trade and investment and easing the movement of people from one country to another. Blaise Compaore, the President of Burkina Faso, blames colonial history for Africa's continued economic balkanization. ""Colonization divided us, and it is not easy to go forward with integration just like that,"" Mr. Compaore said. ""Here, we consider ourselves Burkinabe; around us you have Ivorians or Nigerians or Ghanaians. That's just how we have been separated."" If Mr. Compaore's viewpoint is so commonly heard as to be considered conventional, as this region has moved in this decade toward multiparty politics and steadily more liberalized economies, it is increasingly being challenged as inadequate. Although the region's failure to coalesce can be attributed to the arbitrary European imposition of borders in the last century, international development experts and Africans themselves, from frustrated businessmen to opposition politicians, are focusing new attention on costly mistakes -- by Africans and their foreign partners -- that have taken place since the continent's independence era began with Ghana's statehood in 1957. Laying much of the blame for their underdevelopment at their own doorsteps, many in this region have begun to condemn the rapid transformation of their newly independent countries into predatory states. Rather than seeking to create opportunity, these Governments have sat like the highway policemen, lying in wait for chances to pounce upon business people or ordinary citizens to impose a tax or demand a bribe. ""The major obstacle to integration has been our own governments,"" said Issa Konate, a former Foreign Minister of Burkina Faso who is now an opposition member of the National Assembly. ""Lamentably, the political will to change the situation is lacking because agents of the state have grown used to using corruption to round out their personal budgets."" According to this view, even if they would achieve economies of scale and stimulate economic investment, the creation of a common customs zone, regional utilities and pooled purchases of certain imports would put many government officials out of work, or deprive them of important sources of illicit income. Hence, little or nothing is done. If development experts say that Africans are right to re-examine the ways they have organized their states, many have also concluded that the outside world has played a major role in reinforcing the continent's fragmentation. Here, the criticism focuses on institutions like the World Bank and France, the most active of the Western nations on the continent. ""The World Bank has been talking a lot about regional integration but not really doing very much,"" said Thomas Callaghy, a specialist in African development at the University of Pennsylvania. ""Forgetting all of the fancy schemes that are out there, they could really get things moving by looking at two countries like Ivory Coast and Ghana as a dyad, and funding projects that address the needs of both countries at once."" Instead, for reasons of politics and habit, Mr. Callaghy said, the World Bank and other lenders duplicate Africa's balkanization and ultimately help perpetuate it by organizing their projects on a country-by-country basis. Where politics are concerned, there are not only the selfishly defined interests of elites in each country that are wary of ceding any portion of their sovereignty. In the case of Africa's French-speaking former colonies, there are also the jealously guarded interests of the only former colonial power to have retained its grip on its one-time possessions. Since independence, France has encouraged its former colonies to limit their efforts at integration to each other, excluding English-speaking countries. According to a recently published biography of Jacques Foccart, a senior adviser to de Gaulle, much of France's behavior has been motivated by fears that if left unchecked, West Africa's demographic and economic giant would come to rival France's influence in the region. In just one response to these fears, Mr. Foccart's book tells how Paris worked to encourage the dismemberment of Nigeria by actively supporting Biafran secessionists during the country's civil war in the late 1960's. Businessmen in West Africa describe different actions by Paris in the region today aimed at limiting non-French interests in many spheres, be they those of English-speaking Africans, or Westerners. For Ghana, surrounded as it is by former French colonies, this kind of effort at containment is particularly costly. ""We have taken our power grid all the way to the border region with Burkina Faso,"" said one Ghanaian businessman of efforts by his country to sell its relatively cheap electrical power to its northern neighbor. ""Then the French thing began: a technical issue here, a technical issue there. And although we can resolve them all, for political reasons, the thing just remains stuck there."" Map shows the location of Navrongo, Ghana."9-Apr-95,,"Count the white faces in the boardrooms of the sleek skyscrapers, on the verandas of the gracious sports clubs and around the tables of the chic restaurants. Then submit to a pop history quiz: Who won the liberation war, anyway? Blacks did. But 15 years after Rhodesia became Zimbabwe and the second-to-last bastion of white-minority rule in sub-Saharan Africa vanished, it's easy to be confused. Whites, who make up less than 1 percent of Zimbabwe's population, own an estimated 97 percent of the private wealth here. By many standards, they are living better than ever. Meanwhile, the black masses disproportionately bear the burden of a rising unemployment rate, now at 25 percent, steep inflation, punishing droughts and deep cuts in social spending. The tenacity of white economic domination in the teeth of black political empowerment offers what some here regard as a cautionary tale for Zimbabwe's neighbor to the south. ""If our pattern holds in South Africa 15 years from now, there's going to be trouble -- and I doubt it will wait 15 years to break out,"" said John Makumbe, a professor of political science at the University of Zimbabwe. ""They have a much more entrenched culture of protest than we do. Our political culture is docile."" Certainly Zimbabwe's politics proved docile last week. Voters went to the polls yesterday and today for their fourth parliamentary election since independence in 1980. Despite the mounting economic woes of the masses, President Robert Mugabe's ruling party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, is predicted to win all but a handful of the 150 seats against weak and divided opposition. The party currently holds 147. The only mystery of this election is the turnout. Critics such as Makumbe and a host of human rights groups accuse Mugabe's party of rigging electoral laws, intimidating political opponents, stifling free debate and allowing corrupt government ministers to plunder the treasury and forge cozy alliances with white business. Despite news media that are largely government controlled, these accusations have circulated widely among Zimbabwe's well-educated population of 11 million. Yet they have triggered only episodic racial tension and no discernible political reform movement. Indeed, many black Zimbabweans count their blessings. Politics are stable, racial tensions are low, and ethnic violence has been nonexistent since a post-independence tribal war led to a coalition government incorporating the Shona and Ndebele tribes. On the economic front, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank have prevailed upon the government to adopt an economic structural adjustment program. Its initials, ESAP, and its effects, have spawned the rueful nickname Ever-Suffering African People. Despite the short-term pain, however, it gives the economy a chance to climb out of an investment-stifling debt trap. ""Zimbabweans take the long view -- the work we have to do in terms of black economic empowerment, we have forever,"" said Strive Masiyiwa, a black businessmen who runs an electrical engineering company. ""We know what war has done elsewhere in Africa. As long as we have peace and stability, we know our sons will bear the economic fruits of our political liberation."" Not all blacks are as patient. ""There is going to be a lot of noise, consumer boycotts and street protest after the election,"" predicted Phillip Chiyangwa, president of the Affirmation Active Group, which has been pressing the government to change the rules of the economic game here to favor black businesses. That process is known in Zimbabwe as the ""indigenization"" of the private sector. Since 1990 -- after Mugabe's government began to deemphasize socialist ideology -- the concept has received a great deal of official lip service. So far, black businessmen say it's all talk. They say they are as hobbled as ever by 35 percent interest rates and by banks that march to the tune of the multinational corporations that own them. Laws designed to funnel government contracts to black companies are a sham, said Masiyiwa. And the hope that privatization of state-owned utilities would produce black owners has proven illusory. The most contentious issue is rural land ownership. About 4,000 white farmers own roughly 30 percent of Zimbabwe's best farmland; on it, they produce virtually all of Zimbabwe's commercial crops. Seven million blacks live on farmland hardest hit by drought and have trouble eking out a subsistence. Land was the driving issue behind the guerrilla war that toppled Ian Smith's white-minority government in 1980. Blacks forced to relocate during a century of white settlement yearned to till the same soil their forefathers did. The Mugabe government's first wave of postwar land redistribution was a bust. In 1992 the government passed a law allowing it to appropriate -- with compensation -- the land of commercial farmers for resettlement purposes, triggering great fears in the white community. But so far, said Peter MacSporran, president of the Commercial Farmers' Union, not a single commercial farmer has been forced to sell his land against his will. ""After an initial period of confrontation, we're working well with the government to identify suitable land for resettlement,"" he said. Despite the drought, commercial farmers have reasons to breathe easily these days. The economic liberalization of IMF structural adjustment has meant fewer hassles with government marketing boards, more access to customers abroad and a wider range of imported equipment to purchase. ""Five years ago, if you wanted a tractor here, you were looking at a three-year wait,"" said MacSporran. ""Now, you go to the dealer and he asks, 'What color do you want?' "" The dozen-plus skyscrapers built in Harare in the last five years, which give this capital city the most impressive skyline in sub-Saharan Africa, stand as a vote of confidence by the multinationals in the long-term future of the economy. The vast majority of the white-collar workers in these office towers are blacks who took advantage of the Mugabe government's investment in black education to become clerks, accountants, salesmen, middle-level managers. But there aren't nearly enough jobs. With the official unemployment rate running at 25 percent -- unofficial estimates say it is closer to 40 percent -- Zimbabwe has the dubious distinction of housing the best-educated unemployed work force in Africa. Young blacks appear to be getting discouraged. With no jobs available for high school graduates, and with the government having to impose new school fees to satisfy IMF demands to end budgetary deficits, the school dropout rate has doubled in a decade. All of this seems to be a recipe for unrest. And for a brief stretch late last year and early this year, as the country headed toward this election, there was a sharp rise in anti-white protests. A handful of militant black college students vandalized some downtown clubs and restaurants that whites frequent. The government newspaper carried angry anti-white letters to the editor and anonymous ads that called for the expulsion within a decade of all of Zimbabwe's 80,000 whites -- down from a peak of 270,000 before independence. But as suddenly as the campaign began, it ended. In mid-January, after passions had come to a boil with the conviction of a white doctor for using his black patients as guinea pigs in medical experiments, the government-controlled Herald newspaper announced it would no longer accept letters that inflamed racial passions. A big anti-white rally fizzled. The widespread assumption, said Makumbe, is that Mugabe's government played the anti-white card to divert attention from its own failings. Then when international lending institutions and multinational corporations put out the word that enough was enough, the campaign folded. That explanation may be a bit simplistic. But there's no denying that, 15 years after liberation, Zimbabwe is run by a sometimes stormy marriage of a white economic and black political elite. Even without black ownership of the private sector, there's a big enough patronage base in the civil service and parastatal companies, which together account for about 35 percent of the economy, for the Mugabe government to keep a firm grip on power. Ministers get rich, political opponents get weary, the masses get poorer. The country is stable. Might the same arrangement evolve in South Africa? Comparisons are risky. There are 80,000 whites here; 5 million there. South Africa's economy is 15 times bigger than Zimbabwe's. Race relations have always had a harder edge in South Africa. The black masses there are more urbanized and politicized, and there is a much quicker trigger for violence. But there's one compelling similarity. These are two countries where a small minority of whites own the economy and a large majority of blacks own the politics. It is an inherently unstable arrangement, and so far there's only been one model for achieving stability. It's the Zimbabwean model."12-Sep-95,,"In the tally of scandals surrounding President Frederick Chiluba, let's start with the one about drugs: International donors on which Zambia is dependent forced Chiluba to cut loose a trio of top officials believed to be involved in illicit drug trade. The collapse of Zambian Airways did not help Chiluba much either, as thousands of workers lost their jobs. Soon thereafter, confidence in the economy took another blow: Depositors lost millions when the nation's fourth-largest bank went under despite the government's attempt at a bailout. Then came sex: Lusaka's crusading newspaper, the Post, alleged Chiluba had had an extramarital affair and a child whom he refused to support. And on top of it all came a bizarre twist; the Post reported: Chiluba may not be Chiluba at all and not even a full-fledged Zambian, but a man who took the identity of another and turned his back on his own foreign father. All this intrigue, plus deepening economic hardship as the country undergoes an internationally imposed structural adjustment, has eroded Chiluba's credibility so much that what once seemed unthinkable is happening. The labor leader who swept into office four years ago on a reformist wave that ended 27 years of autocratic rule under Kenneth Kaunda and buoyed hopes for democracy's spread on the continent now faces perhaps his stiffest opposition from none other than the Big Man himself. Kaunda, known here as K.K., wants his country back. Kaunda, 71, who used to publicly weep for Africa and style himself a benevolent patron to the people he helped liberate from British colonialism in what was then called Northern Rhodesia, represents the first generation of post-independence African leaders. He clung to power, developed a cult of personality, squashed opposition and imposed tight state control of the economy -- to the benefit of Zambians for a while, until fiscal strangulation ensued. Although he seemed a discredited has-been when Zambians rioted over skyrocketing food prices, ransacked his home, then booted him from office in 1991, Kaunda this summer regained the leadership of his party and has garnered the support of several important leaders within the Bemba tribe, which represents 35 percent of Zambia's nearly 9 million people. While some observers feel it unlikely that Zambians will choose to return to Kaunda and the failed socialist policies he represents, others say that the despair of the masses, especially in rural areas suffering under the dual burdens of state mismanagement of agriculture and a debilitating drought, gives Kaunda a solid shot at taking back his country in elections to be held next year. Zambians are widely disaffected by unfulfilled political promises and struggling under crushing economic hardship, which means democracy here is far less a priority than food and jobs. Four years ago, Chiluba emerged as the only leader who could oust Kaunda, and he did so with nearly 80 percent of the vote. ""The issue is just as it was in 1991,"" said Lucy Sichone, founder of the Zambian Civic Education Association and a former member of Kaunda's party. ""The only person who can get rid of Chiluba is K.K."" ""We haven't built up democratic institutions,"" said Sichone. ""That's why I'm afraid that K.K. cannot be dismissed."" Kaunda has yet to outline what economic policies he would pursue, but he is getting much mileage out of Chiluba's credibility problems, saying in a recent interview that Chiluba's Movement for Multiparty Democracy ""is a cartel for organized crime"" and that the Chiluba government contains two dozen officials whom Kaunda detained for trafficking in Mandraax, a sedative for which Zambia has become a primary transit point en route to South Africa. But Chiluba, 50, is striking back with some heavy artillery of his own. His government this month revealed what it called underground torture chambers constructed beneath State House, the presidential residence, during Kaunda's reign, when political opponents were routinely imprisoned. The government repeatedly has denied Kaunda permits to hold rallies and has arrested him for defying the ban. Chiluba's party also has floated a constitutional proposal that would place the presidency off-limits to candidates of non-Zambian parentage. Kaunda's parents were born in Malawi. As for his own parentage, Chiluba denies the newspaper report questioning his identity, as he denies all the other scandals that have tainted his presidency. What cannot be denied is the economic hardship that has fallen on most Zambians. Chiluba inherited an economic mess from Kaunda at a time when the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which had been unable to persuade Kaunda to comply with earlier structural adjustments, imposed one of the strictest adjustment programs on the globe. ""This country has undergone economic surgery without anaesthetic,"" said Gedion Nkojo, the World Bank chief here. Under Kaunda, Zambia fit the classic mold of the command economy. Through companies it controls, the state ran virtually everything, from the cultivation of maize to the baking of bread to the mining of copper. Payrolls were heavily padded, with employees receiving housing, cars and free airfare on the national airline. Even food was subsidized. But Zambia's population skyrocketed, from about 3.5 million in 1964, when Kaunda came to power, to nearly 9 million today, and the price of copper, which accounted for 90 percent of Zambia's foreign exchange earnings and as much as 50 percent of government revenues, plunged. Kaunda began to borrow heavily from international donors, sinking Zambia into a black hole of debt. Under World Bank guidance, Chiluba largely has succeeded in meeting the program's goals by lowering inflation and interest rates and stabilizing the once wildly fluctuating local currency, the kwacha, said Nkojo. He also has ended state subsidies in education and health and slowly is selling off the state-controlled companies. Such reforms have laid the groundwork for more private investment in the country and the ultimate improvement in socioeconomic conditions. But within Chiluba's own circle there are those who complain of the continued influence of state spending and patronage. For example, said Mundia Sikatana, a Chiluba adviser and a founder of the Movement for Multiparty Democracy, the government continues to provide vehicles to hundreds of civil servants, including the fuel to run them. The government, he said, ""cannot abandon the old habits. The [structural adjustment program] is not doing enough."" Try telling that to ordinary Zambians, for whom the end of price controls has meant a 40-fold increase in the price of maize over the past few years. Seventy percent of all Zambians live in poverty. Infant mortality is up, and adult life expectancy is down -- defying the trend in most of the rest of the world. The despair of ordinary Zambians will likely translate into widespread apathy, predicted Sichone. Or it could leave some voters longing for what seemed the good old days of Kaunda. The choice facing Zambians, said a former Zambian diplomat, may lead to the same end. If the economy continues to decline in the face of structural adjustments, eventually mass uprisings will occur. And if Kaunda wins and returns to the policies of the past, and international lenders pull out and stop propping up the economy, the same anger may explode. ""We do have a serious political crisis,"" the diplomat said. ""People are starving. It is tough. And frankly, I don't know how much longer it can go on."""12-Dec-95,,"Mayor John King'ori says he has a call from God to salvage this city. Yet attempts by Mr. King'ori so far suggest that he may also need some help from God to provide the three million or so residents here with such basic services as water, electricity, garbage pickup, adequate roads and reliable telephone service. The number of people in Kenya's capital has tripled in the last decade and is expected to grow to 4.5 million by the turn of the century. But the city's finances are so poor, the mayor said, that there is no money to repair roads, expand water supplies or deploy enough trucks to collect garbage for the current population. What's more, for trying to fight corruption in the City Council, he has received anonymous death threats and was recently wounded by a young gunman who tried to kill him. ""Nairobi has been dismantled,"" Mr. King'ori said in a recent interview in his office. ""Water and sewage is a great problem. Roads are a huge problem. We lack the funds. We are paying a lot of money for telephones and electricity, but why do we not have enough? I complain like other citizens. The charges are there but the services are not there."" Though to some extent Nairobi's problems are shared by most other third-world capitals, Kenya, surrounded by countries afflicted by civil war or ruled by dictators, established itself as eastern Africa's most industrialized and most stable nation and attracted much foreign investment and tourism. But increasingly in the last 10 years, corruption and mismanagement have undermined the foundations for energy, telecommunications and transportation, all sectors of patronage and power. Recently, after a widespread day-long blackout in Nairobi's business area, the telephone system there collapsed. Even when the system is working, a phone call across town often requires more than five attempts because the technology dates from the 1930's, and connections are uncertain once they are made. A sporadic supply of electricity forces schoolchildren to study by candlelight, spoils food in refrigerators, delays meals when stoves do not work and stalls the work of businesses that depend on fax machines, photo-copiers, printers, computers, elevators. For residents like George Mwangi Juguna, 50, a guard who lives in one of Nairobi's slums, the economic decay means that he wakes up his five children an hour before dawn so they can buy water while supplies are available, a task that requires them to walk two miles before heading off to school. ""Getting water is a nightmare,"" Mr. Juguna said. ""Most of the people here just go without water for up to two days at a time. The problems can only get worse because people keep on moving into Nairobi."" Seeking to rebuild the country's crumbling system of basic services, the World Bank and Western donors plan to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to privatize energy and telecommunications as well as to rebuild roads, but progress is painstakingly slow and several of the projects have not yet been approved by the donors. ""They've dragged their feet,"" a World Bank official said about the Kenyan Government's efforts at privatization and maintenance, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""Now we see the cost to the nation,"" the official said. ""Now they're finally appreciating the cost. The way to go is not to reform attitudes but to break it up and expose it to competitive market forces."""28-Jan-96,,"The president and his cronies are accused far and wide of using the treasury as their personal bank account. Buses don't run. Phones don't work. The jungle is fast overtaking many roads. But the people of Zaire, despite decades of corruption and ineptitude, have found ways to adapt. Education has all but collapsed in parts of the country where teachers are not being paid. To fill the void, parents have started their own schools or, if they can afford it, are paying teachers' salaries themselves. Ambulances are few, so when a disaster happens -- such as the plane crash here in the capital this month that killed as many as 350 people -- private citizens take the injured to the hospital in their own cars. To prevent soldiers from stealing civilians' food, people in one town have taught the soldiers how to harvest crops themselves. Money is so tight that some families have been reduced to feeding their children every other day. Rich in diamonds, copper and other minerals, and vast enough to border nine other nations, Zaire -- with an area the size of the United States east of the Mississippi and a population of 44 million -- has long been considered one of Central Africa's pivotal countries. During the Cold War, the United States and other Western nations eagerly backed the country's anti-communist leader, President Mobutu Sese Seko. But as superpower rivalries have withered and the excesses of Mobutu's 30-year rule have taken their toll, his standing has diminished at home and abroad. As he and his opposition remain stalemated in their protracted five-year transition to democratic elections, government has lost meaning for many Zairians as they attempt each day to secure survival and thereby accept what elsewhere would be unacceptable. That point is driven home routinely when one of the overloaded and unregulated trucks that are used as buses crashes and kills dozens of passengers. Zairians are ""pioneering new coping mechanisms,"" said Ian Brown, head of the Oxfam relief agency, one of several nongovernmental organizations, including churches, whose educational, training and medical services are virtually supplanting the collapsed and paralyzed state. ""The leaders are struggling with each other instead of taking care of the real situation of the country,"" said Sidonie Memba, 37, who grows corn by the side of a road and sells it to passersby. A mother of 10, she said she earns the equivalent of about $ 10 on a good day. ""If I do not sell, I won't get anything to eat, so I don't care much about politics because I don't get anything from the fight."" Zaire's economic and political squeeze is hard to live with, but nothing can be done about it, said Sophie Kanku, 28, who sells shoes in a large outdoor market. Like several Zairians interviewed at random, Kanku freely expressed her disaffection with the president and his power. ""He has got guns,"" she said. ""We have no guns. And he has got money. We are empty-handed."" Kanku and Prisca Nta, 22, together expressed the fear that the truck accidents and plane crashes that have taken so many lives recently are a kind of extension of Mobutu's power to wear down the will of people who might oppose him. In response to this sense of powerlessness in the face of a seemingly larger-than-life leader once known as ""the Guide,"" Zairians have mobilized in hundreds of small ways to eke out a living. Children beg in the streets but also shine shoes for cash. Men sell rusted tin cans and rags for reuse. Families or neighbors share food to help each other out. With the degeneration of government, more people are using any pretext for demanding cash, making for a nation on the take: Perhaps the airport workers who demand cash at the baggage X-ray machine have children at home in need of food; or perhaps they are just taking out of greed. That pervasive greed has given Zaire the label of ""kleptocracy,"" a reference to the system of thievery that those with intimate knowledge of Zaire say has characterized the official approach to the public purse for several years. The kleptocracy has rendered this vast, resource-rich nation unable -- and apparently unwilling -- to provide basic services. The telephone system, for example, does not work because ""money to be used for maintenance has been stolen,"" said U.S. Ambassador Daniel Simpson. ""Instead of laying the cables, they stole the money."" Zairians now rely on cellular phones -- if they can afford them. The same can be said of the national airline, transport corporation and copper mines -- all bankrupted by a combination of mismanagement and corruption. Copper production, which used to account for 70 percent of export earnings, has fallen from about 488,000 tons a year in 1988 to less than a tenth of that today, said Mabi Mulumba, head of the Zairian equivalent of the General Accounting Office. He said his office has documented the ""misallocation"" of 30 percent of the state budget in 1994. Diamond mining has increased in recent years, but it is largely controlled by foreign interests or syndicates. So out of control was the state treasury in the early 1990s that two-thirds of the currency in circulation was counterfeit, said Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo, who is lauded by the Clinton administration for reining in the central bank and breaking up Lebanese and Zairian syndicates that flooded Zaire with counterfeit cash. Because of the economic mess, all foreign assistance to Zaire has stopped. U.S. law bars direct aid to a government in arrears on U.S. loans; Zaire owes the United States $ 800 million. The European Union also closed the aid pipeline when Mobutu reneged on his promise to share power with the opposition. Under intense international pressure -- the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund also stopped giving aid -- Mobutu agreed in 1990 to put an end to the one-party state and open the way for multi-party democracy. Since then, transitional governments have changed so often that people here have lost count. The Clinton administration, meanwhile, is looking to Kengo for reform. He was selected as prime minister by the transitional parliament after its original choice, Etienne Tshisekedi, was fired by Mobutu despite a pledge to accept the opposition's choice. Although Kengo is highly unpopular because of a manner that some here describe as dictatorial and because of his ties to Mobutu, for whom he was prime minister twice before, Washington views him as a safe bet on the grounds that he is ineligible for the presidency and thus presumably cannot be corrupted by ambition. By law, the presidency is reserved for people of Zairian parentage. Kengo was born of Polish and Zairian parents. The stern-faced prime minister, however, smiled when asked in an interview if his ambitions are being thwarted by the parentage law. Noting the fluidity of the transition and the recent appointment of an electoral commission, he said: ""The electoral law is not yet set."" Supporters of Tshisekedi fault Kengo for his ties to Mobutu and for not improving life for Zairians through gains in schools, hospitals and salaries of government employees. ""The Westerners who are supporting Kengo are doing their best not to talk about the bad aspects,"" said Mukenda wa Mulumba, an aide to Tshisekedi. ""I'm not blaming the Westerners for what may happen, but they have part of the responsibility for supporting a bad scheme that doesn't lead the country toward success or improvement."" Mobutu, meanwhile, remains the Big Man presiding over Zairian politics but spends most of his time at his jungle palace in the equatorial town of Gbadolite, from which he ventures only rarely. He has promised to travel around the nation to campaign in advance of elections that are to take place by July 1997."4-Feb-96,,"ACROSS the continent of Africa, for many of the countries that can still dream of economic progress instead of simply hoping to ward off disaster, the most seductive development model lies not in the ripe old West, but rather in the fermenting economies of the Far East. Hoping to copy blueprints that allowed some Asian countries to leap from poverty to relative prosperity in little more than a generation, more and more African leaders are heading off these days on tours of countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Korea. And along with their economic recipes, these leaders are returning home with authoritarian political notions. These may clash sharply with the Western ideal of democracy, but they have the merit, the leaders say, of being more in tune with traditional African values. Sacrifice and Obedience Having flirted in this decade with democracy, one country after another is now seeking to implement a form of government that meets some technical requirements of democracy but in reality is the most formalized kind of pluralism possible: one in which only the most marginal questions of national interest are subject to open debate, and leaders rig their electoral systems, minimizing to virtually nil the chances that they will be voted out of office. In doing so, governments in countries from Ivory Coast to Uganda are invoking the model of the tightly controlled Asian society, with its Confucian notions of sacrifice and obedience. The pro-Government Ivorian newspaper, Fraternite Matin, carried the strongest recent articulation of this philosophy earlier this month, in a lead editorial that said that the strength of Japan came from a caste system in which ""the samurai does not seek to replace the emperor, or to speak in his place."" Pursuing this line to its chilling conclusion, the editorialist proposed a formula that would enable this country to develop: ""The party member needs to stick to the line and not impose his point of view on superiors; the manager will not exceed his prerogatives and divert the funds of the enterprise for which he has responsibility; the expatriate should not violate any of the rules governing his stay; the cleric, rather than giving political speeches to support one camp or another, should stick to what he can contribute to the spirituality of his flock."" For many experts on Africa, there are many problems with these nose-to-the-grindstone nostrums. Not the least is the fact that they leave unanswered a question that this continent has managed more disastrously than any other: Who will keep an eye on the leaders? ""The success of authoritarian governments elsewhere is based on things that African leaders have not paid sufficient attention to,"" said Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Liberian who is the deputy administrator for Africa of the United Nations Development Program. ""First there was an emphasis on human resource development. Just look at the high literacy levels in most Asian societies. ""Then, Asian governments built strong partnerships with the private sector, which ultimately served as counterweights to authoritarian power. ""Finally you have a system of ethics: In the Korean example, former heads of state were ultimately arrested because they offended some commonly held values."" Although it may sound new, today's Asian-inspired ideology is far from the continent's first experiment with paternalism, which was in part a legacy of colonialism. Africa's early leaders, from Kenya's Jomo Kenyatta and Zambia's Kenneth Kaunda to Ivory Coast's Felix Houphouet-Boigny, all demanded the virtually unquestioned obedience of the population under one-party states, which they justified by talk of Africa's traditional socialist values and its emphasis on consensus. Control Means Profit Rather than help build thriving new nations, however, the lack of accountability built into these political creations favored the emergence of corrupt elites who quickly discovered that controlling the state offered unparalleled opportunities for stealing from it. ""What we are seeing today is an exact replay of what happened in the 1960's in the move toward one-party states: Maintaining the formalism of democracy while gutting it of its substance,"" said Thomas Callaghy, a professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania. ""What you end up with is 'crony capitalism,' an extension of the patron-client form of free enterprise, which, in the African case, has always placed the emphasis on the welfare of the patron."" With few checks on this sort of power, Africa will be hard pressed to develop under any economic model. Instead of seeing the kind of accumulation of savings necessary for an industrial takeoff -- the kind of capital accumulation that took place in Asia -- the continent has witnessed an unparalleled flight of capital, as elites bank their earnings in safe havens elsewhere. According to one United Nations estimate, $200 billion or 90 percent of the sub-Saharan part of the continent's gross domestic product (much of it illicitly earned), was shipped to foreign banks in 1991 alone. Guess Who Gets Rich In each country, the formula for enrichment differs. In Senegal, World Bank officials have said that Government imports of rice, the staple food, have constituted a major source of unaccounted-for revenue for ruling party leaders for years. In Congo, top officials and their relatives sign deals that mortgage the heavily indebted country's oil earnings years in advance, in exchange for quick cash. In Kenya, the Government plows ahead with plans to build a major international airport in the President's home town. In military-controlled Nigeria, the Government awards so-called ""lifting contracts"" to its political friends that amount to little more than gifts of handsome commissions on oil contracts. Based on realities like these, a confidential report prepared last year by the French Foreign Ministry warned of the ""criminalization of sub-Saharan Africa"" by its elites. While the ideologues of present-day Africa wish to draw out cultural parallels between the supposedly deferential masses of Asia and hordes of Africans whose salvation, they say, lies in a sort of unquestioning acceptance of a new work ethnic, for many the recent news out of South Korea may inspire other observations. Reports that two past presidents of that country amassed huge slush funds have led to dramatic confessions of corruption and the arrest of these leaders, along with those of several captains of Korean industry.  This can be seen as a consequence of the lack of democracy that prevailed through much of that country's modern history. It Can't Happen Here As much as some proponents of an African resurrection would like to follow Asian models, at least two elements in the recent Korean scandal stick out as inconceivable on this continent. In the primary capitalism that still prevails in these parts, heads of industry frequently don't have any need to pay bribes to African leaders. As often as not, they are buddies, cousins and sons. Then again, in an environment where courts are subject to political control, Parliaments act as rubber stamps, and presidents stay in power as long as they like, who could get caught?"18-Mar-96,,"On Monday, 90 percent of the voters in this sliver of a country are expected to take part in a democratic election that is extraordinary for what it is not. It is apparently not rigged. It is not rendered irrelevant by an opposition boycott. Its result is not overshadowed by a civil conflict and is not expected to trigger violence. Those facts are unusual for a political contest in Africa, where most of the 18 elections scheduled this year will be riddled with fraud, shunned by opposition politicians or dwarfed by ongoing civil conflict. Witness some of the past month's elections in Africa. Sudan and Sierra Leone held votes in the midst of brutal civil wars, neither of which appears likely to cool anytime soon. This weekend, Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe ran unopposed as he glided to victory in a vote fraught with allegations that the ruling party used fraud and intimidation to keep its grip on power. But in Benin, which in 1991 became one of the first nations in sub-Saharan Africa to embrace multi-party politics, voters could become the first on the continent to toss out a democratically elected incumbent. That Nicephore Soglo could be toppled by former president Mathieu Kerekou, whose 19-year reign as Benin's president shredded the economy and caused great social upheaval, is evidence that this is a working democracy, analysts here say. The vote Monday is a runoff after the first round 15 days ago. The democracy established by this West African country of 6 million people ""is strong enough that the process will not be reversed,"" one Western ambassador said. Indeed, Kerekou, a Marxist-Leninist military ruler who seized power in a 1972 coup and lost 1991 elections to then-prime minister Soglo, has insisted that he has abandoned communism, promising to keep Benin on a track of private-sector development and political openness. Specifics of the 64-year-old politician's program are fuzzy, but he has tapped into the country's anxiety over several issues: high unemployment; divisions between the resource-rich south and the desperately poor north; and the appearance that Soglo's family has much influence in his administration. Opponents of Soglo, a former World Bank economist, say he has spent more time courting international favor -- he has received lavish praise from the United States -- than attacking Benin's social and economic ills. They note that in one Soglo campaign billboard, he wears a cowboy hat. ""Soglo is an impostor,"" said Albert Tevoedjre, Kerekou's campaign manager. ""He thinks he is above the law. The Americans are completely in the dark about how he is really running this country."" Political activists on both sides agree that Kerekou destroyed Benin's economy while in office. At the same time, a country known for its strong education system saw its schools deteriorate. A behemoth-like bureaucracy crashed under its own weight, as government could not pay civil servants. Corruption flourished. Throughout Kerekou's years, students rioted. The military attempted two coups within three months in 1988. Ethnic tensions boiled. As even one Kerekou supporter said, ""His biggest problem today is that he has experience and a terrible record. And, in all honesty, he has not really articulated a very convincing program."" In early 1990, Kerekou agreed to a national political conference that led to the dismantling of his regime. The country's military political structure became a civilian one. Political dissidents received amnesty. A human rights commission was established. Most important, Kerekou gently left Benin's political scene after succumbing to Soglo in a presidential runoff in March 1991. Soglo's supporters cite Cotonou, Benin's economic nerve center, as evidence of the country's turnaround. Its roads, once pocked with holes, are smooth. Dozens of new businesses have opened. The government has privatized many companies and shrunk the bureaucracy. ""The people who criticize the president do not remember how this country suffered,"" said K.A. Osseni, a businesswoman in Cotonou and a former government minister. ""Soglo has not been perfect, but if he has made mistakes, let us ask him to change."" Soglo's detractors say the country's improvements are tainted. They say many of Cotonou's roads were built only within the past year, as Benin hustled to prepare for a summit of Africa's French-speaking countries. And while Benin's cities have seen changes, many of its villages remain without schools, roads or easily accessible water. Slashing the bureaucracy has left thousands jobless; unemployment among young adults in Cotonou approaches 30 percent. ""After my schooling, I know I cannot get a job with the government,"" said Magloire Edey, 27, an English student at the National University of Benin. ""I am preparing myself psychologically"" for unemployment. ""I blame Soglo because the jobs were lost, but he has not done anything to replace them,"" added Edey, who supports Kerekou. Soglo supporter Fidele Sonon, a 26-year-old student, interrupted: ""It's not fair to blame him completely. If the former government had given more power to the private sector, we wouldn't be complaining as much as we are today. The private sector has to develop, and people have to create their own jobs."" In the end, the role of Soglo's family, rather than any specific policy, may be his undoing. His wife, a member of parliament, is accused of political tinkering. His brother-in-law is minister of state, the country's second-most powerful position. One of his sons is a special adviser. One of his brothers is an ambassador. Even his bodyguards are said to be relatives. ""The perception is that he's taking advantage of his position,"" said Eric Tevoedjre, son of Kerekou's campaign manager. ""People expect him to choose members of his government based on intelligence and quality of their work, not because they're family."" Meanwhile, a pre-vote anticipation has electrified this city of coconut trees and soft-sand beaches. People hang out of bus and car windows, waving political banners and shouting slogans. The yards in front of many businesses are studded with political signs. Volunteers hand out thousands of fliers. Political analysts expect a high turnout for Monday's vote, the results of which are not expected for several days. Earlier this month, in a contest that included several candidates, Soglo garnered 35 percent of the vote, Kerekou won 33 percent. Many voters see neither candidate as an ideal choice, echoing sentiments heard in some of the world's oldest democracies. ""Really we have a choice between two evils,"" said Sonon, the student, ""and we have to choose the lesser."""29-Jun-97,,"The past month's street fights for power in three African capitals underscore that this continent's saluted post-Cold War transition from authoritarian rule toward democracy remains at an early, embattled stage. Pillars of smoke have risen over the capitals of the Congo Republic, Sierra Leone and the Central African Republic. Bands of men have fired rifles and rockets in and out of government buildings, declaring their right to rule. Westerners have rushed to pack suitcases and flee, sometimes amid rattling gunfire and the shouts of U.S. or French troops evacuating them in military helicopters or cargo planes. Images televised worldwide give the appearance of an Africa where democracy is doomed. Each of the capital cities shattered by recent uprisings -- Sierra Leone's Freetown and Central African Republic's Bangui, as well as Brazzaville in the Congo Republic, which lies across the Congo River from the former Zaire -- not long ago was celebrating its first multi-party election and civilian leader after long periods of single-party and military rule. But alongside such dramatic setbacks, democracy in Africa is evolving in ways that are less visible but more basic, many Africans and Western observers say. Across the continent, even in countries still under authoritarian rule, people are building civil societies and raising pressure for rule by consent of the governed. Even in the capitals that have fallen under the gun this month, swelling networks of human rights committees, church groups, labor, business and professional associations have been insistently voicing popular aspirations. ""Despite recent events . . . significant improvement in political stability and the shift to democracy have underpinned social peace in much of Africa, encouraging the participation of civil society in the development process, and strengthening the legitimacy of governments,"" Callisto Madavo and Jean-Louis Sarbib, vice presidents of the World Bank, wrote this week in the daily International Herald Tribune. Africa in the 1990s has made its strongest moves ever toward democratic rule -- most prominently in South Africa's euphoric elevation of Nelson Mandela from prisoner to president. Ghana, Mali, Benin, Mozambique and other countries have won praise for fair elections and broadened civil liberties. But the trend is a patchwork. Governments in states such as Nigeria, Kenya, Gabon and Cameroon have remained repressive, according to domestic and foreign monitors, aborting or rigging their elections to keep power. The disparate upheavals of recent weeks have startled African and Western scholars into seeking some common thread. Many ponder whether one of the most important events in recent African history -- last month's surprisingly easy overthrow of strongman Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire by rebel leader Laurent Kabila, who renamed the country Congo -- ""may have sent a signal [to other Africans] that it's possible to take power militarily,"" said Constance Freeman, Africa specialist at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies. But while Kabila's victory may have provided momentary encouragement to armed men trying to take over other African states, it was orchestrated and achieved largely from the outside -- by countries like Rwanda, Uganda and Angola, which backed Kabila. The battles in Brazzaville, Freetown and Bangui, on the other hand, all spring from the deep poverty, social inequality and authoritarian political culture that dominate Africa. The World Bank counts 45 percent of Africans living on less than $ 1 per day, and the United Nations' 1997 Human Development Report concludes that ""the depth of poverty . . . is greater in sub-Saharan Africa than anywhere else in the world."" This season's uprisings, like most of Africa's ongoing conflicts, have been started by armed groups of despairing poor who see no hope of using politics to win a share of power or wealth. African leaders -- and would-be leaders -- recruit these overwhelmingly young, poor, marginalized men to the kinds of personal militias that have been battling in Brazzaville, capital of the Congo Republic, next door to Kabila's renamed Congo. While popular pressures forced former military ruler Denis Sassou-Nguesso to hold elections in 1992 -- which he lost -- he retained his personal army, which has clashed in Brazzaville this month with troops and militiamen loyal to his elected successor, President Pascal Lissouba. The background to fighting has been similar in the Central African Republic. A century of authoritarian rule by France and several dictators -- including the infamous Jean-Bedel Bokassa, who declared himself emperor -- has offered its people even less opportunity than other Africans to participate in the running of their country. But petitions, strikes and public rallies for democracy -- along with pressure by France, which bases troops in Bangui -- forced Gen. Andre Kolingba to permit the first free presidential elections in 1993. The mutiny in Bangui, which raged for a week before a truce was brokered today, is the latest of several staged there by low-ranking soldiers. Like the others, it began as a protest at late paychecks but is centered on Kolingba's Yakoma tribe and may represent an effort by him or his supporters to regain power. But simultaneous with the violence, the country's democracy movement is building its base with the development of civic organizations, including a vigorous association of women lawyers and a human rights commission. ""Ten years ago, nobody would have accepted such groups,"" but now ""there is a general recognition that they have a role to play in governance,"" said Chris Fomunyoh, who has worked in the country for Washington's National Democratic Institute for International Affairs. The recent violence in African capitals ""is a setback,"" Fomunyoh said. ""And we'll have to expect [such setbacks] to continue, certainly into the next decade."" In other countries, even where poverty, violence and repression are at their worst, foundations of democracy are growing. Despite continued authoritarian rule under Kenya's President Daniel arap Moi, ""civil society has grown dramatically,"" said Maina Kiai, head of the five-year-old Kenyan Human Rights Commission. ""Organized sectors of society are operating outside of government . . . to build democracy"" from the bottom up, he said, and ""broadly speaking, in Africa one sees that kind of evolution."" In Kinshasa, capital of Congo, formerly known as Zaire, an independent press, human rights organizations, church commissions and opposition parties hounded Mobutu throughout the '90s, demanding democratic rule. Such groups slowly hollowed out Mobutu's political base, facilitating his overthrow this spring. Kabila has assumed sweeping powers and banned political activity, but pro-democracy groups are responding with many of the same tactics that they employed against Mobutu. In Liberia, civil society is pulsing despite seven years of grinding factional warfare that has left much of the country living under plastic sheeting or tents or in the ruins of abandoned buildings. Ragged boys in the streets of Monrovia hawk at least a dozen daily and weekly newspapers full of debate among political parties and civic organizations. It is partly because of public demands -- especially from women, according to Liberian political monitors -- that the warlords who have fought for power now are submitting to elections scheduled for next month. The coup d'etat in Sierra Leone has reversed, but not crushed, another of Africa's recent democratic advances. Last year, having forced a military government to hold elections, Sierra Leoneans braved gunfire from resistant soldiers and a rural rebel movement to elect a civilian president, Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. He named a broad government and quickly negotiated peace with the rebels. Last month, unpaid and impoverished enlisted men mounted a revolt, and quickly were joined by the rebels, who are based in the country's most economically and politically marginalized area. But officers in the junta have conceded in interviews that opposition from the population and from African governments is forcing them to look for a negotiated way out of power."5-Oct-97,,"THIS country's recently deceased dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, became rich as many foreign loans and government budgets were pocketed by a leadership that was arguably the most corrupt in the world. As President of what was then Zaire, Mr. Mobutu amassed a fortune that by some estimates reached $8 billion. But if Mr. Mobutu was the symbol par excellence of African-style corruption, with his family junkets on chartered Concorde jets and a personal barber flown in monthly from the Waldorf-Astoria, one need only gaze across the Congo River at Brazzaville, the capital of the Congo Republic, to find a more up-to-date model. For four months now, two presidents, one current and one former, have fought bitterly for power in the former French colony, virtually leveling its once-quaint capital, in what diplomats and international bankers say is a naked contest for control of the lucrative trade in the country's annual production of 15 million tons of oil. That is, it seems, the African way. The world's poorest continent is also the one where high government officials are least accountable to ordinary citizens. Left unstated, however, is the important role that outsiders play in encouraging what has become one of Africa's most destructive habits. What makes this continent stand out is not the existence of such corruption but the stark background of poverty and the endless variety of brazen official thievery that takes place, often with the active cooperation of well-known Western corporations. ""In parts of Asia there is undoubtedly more corruption than you find in Africa,"" said one World Bank official who has worked extensively on the issue of corruption on both continents. ""The difference is that corruption in Asia is predictable. ""In many parts of Africa, there are virtually no rules, and the businessman never knows where he stands,"" the official said. ""This scares many investors away. Moreover, in Asia profits from corruption tend to be invested in productive activities. In Africa, the capital is consumed wastefully, or banked overseas."" The Congo Republic scarcely has two million people, and yet many remain poor despite the country's fabulous wealth in oil and other resources. Almost from the time of independence in 1960, politics has been the affair of a small and rapacious elite who, through coups, assassinations and now highly ethnicized urban combat, have fought for economic control. Known as the Pierre Cardin Marxist for his luxurious tastes, the former leader, Gen. Denis Sassou Nguesso, amassed enough money in 13 years in power to raise a private army in his northern ethnic homeland and has spent it freely in recent months to fight the Government to a standstill. And diplomats say the current President, Pascal Lissouba, a plant geneticist by training, wasted no time after his election in 1992 in taking personal advantage of the country's abundant resources. Mr. Lissouba reportedly now owns a luxurious ""hotel particulier,"" or urban chateau, in one of Paris's priciest districts. Scarcely concealed self-enrichment of this sort are rife throughout France's former central African colonies. In neighboring Cameroon, President Paul Biya was estimated in recent press reports to have amassed a private fortune of $75 million in his 15 years in power. Such wealth is said not to include two Presidential Boeing 747's, two palatial residences in Cameroon and opulent homes in France and Switzerland. In the context of his region, however, Mr. Biya might be considered only moderately well off. Tiny Gabon, another oil-rich country with scarcely one million inhabitants, still largely lacks roads, schools and adequate health clinics, and yet President Omar Bongo, a hugely wealthy man, owns more Parisian real estate than any other foreign leader, according to the French weekly L'Autre Afrique. The French Touch A key to all of these presidential fortunes is the French oil company Elf Aquitaine, which dominates production -- and, according to its own former officials, politics -- in the region, helping keep friendly autocrats financially satisfied so as to maintain its hold on one of the world's richest petroleum zones. But the French are far from alone. In oil-rich Angola, international bankers say, American companies play similar games with a deeply corrupt elite. In Nigeria, another oil economy with fabulously wealthy leaders and crushingly poor citizens, not only oil but construction has been a favorite rich target for unscrupulous outsiders. Diplomats say one German engineering firm nearly cornered the market on big projects during the recent rule of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, riding the huge contracts it won for roads and bridges to emerge as one of Germany's biggest contractors -- and, through large kickbacks, helping make General Babangida one of Africa's richest leaders. All of this raises the question of what the outside world can do to rein in corruption. Some favor strengthening the obligations of foreign companies to conduct business honestly. The World Bank, which has begun to make corruption a major theme of its development programs, has threatened to cut off funds to blatantly corrupt countries. Kenya recently became the first target of this new approach. Other experts say corruption can be beaten down only by building up African institutions and reinforcing democratic checks on highly centralized executive power. ""Corruption is a problem of systems and not individuals or cultures,"" said Robert Klitgaard, a Rand Corporation expert who wrote a seminal account of African corruption, ""Tropical Gangsters"" (Basic Books, 1990). ""In Africa corruption is such a big problem because the systems have broken down so completely. ""If somebody has monopoly power over a good or service and has discretionary power over whether you get it, and there is no accountability, there is going to be corruption. This is where we must work for change."""30-Apr-98,,"When he was 12, Uri Dromi remembers shoving into a crowd in Haifa and standing four hours to watch the parade marking Israel's 10th anniversary. It was a sweltering day, and the crowd was thick and airless. But he was caught up in the excitement, he said. There was a different feeling then than the one settling on Israel tonight as it begins the celebration of its 50th anniversary on Thursday with two days of fireworks and public ceremonies. ""We were pushing each other to see the soldiers on parade"" 40 years ago, Dromi said. ""We wanted to see the jets fly by. It was fresh. It was something that we, and especially our parents, had to remind themselves was really happening."" The anniversary of the declaration of the Jewish state in 1948 is a coin with two sides, past and present. As Israelis turn it over and over, they feel a mixture of pride, nostalgia and some discouragement. Perhaps that early anniversary was gilded by an exuberance of youth -- both his and the country's -- mused Dromi, who grew up to fly air force planes in combat, eventually became the chief government spokesman and now is a radio commentator and works at promoting democracy. ""We are not so happy now. People are proud of what we have achieved, but they are worried about the future,"" he said. ""Now, we are facing the limits of our power."" Israel's Jubilee Anniversary is prompting a heavy dose of introspection, and there is little sense that Israelis are happy about what they see. The reflection is of a country mired in a tense deadlock with Arabs, beset by internal squabbling, soured on its institutions and coping with a slowing economy. The irony is that Israel's ""Fiftieth"" may be celebrated more by outsiders. American and European media are treating the anniversary like a news event of extraordinary proportions. The Israeli press office issued credentials to 400 journalists for stories in advance of the anniversary and expects 350 of them to be here during the festivities. Virtually every major U.S. newspaper is printing a series of stories or a special section. The New York Times published a book for the occasion. European papers are following suit, and the BBC's World Service is carrying a week's worth of television programming that was six months in the making. Israel is playing the smiling host. It will mount a lavish stage production Thursday, and the military will be flying, sailing, parachuting and shooting in displays all around the country. Throughout this year, even the most routine occasion has been crowned a Jubilee Event. But the preparations have served to amplify the cynicism at home. The official festival committee has been marred by mismanagement; there have been allegations of corruption; and a succession of directors have quit or been fired. Critics charge the whole affair is colored by a right-wing agenda. The current director, Doron Shmueli, acknowledged he had cut out any mention of the peace pact Israel signed with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat because of his personal dislike for Arafat. Instead, he opened the celebration with a $ 150,000 bash thrown for the 450 militant Jewish settlers who live in a camp inside the Arab-administered West Bank city of Hebron. Only a public outcry forced Shmueli to include any mention in the Jubilee's historical highlights of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination in 1995 by a right-wing Jew. Israeli peace groups had to go to court to be included in the Jubilee program. Efforts by the festival committee to win the hearts of Israelis largely seemed to flop. There was such an outcry over plans to spend $ 20,000 to hire heartthrob pop singer Rita for a three-minute performance that she quit the program in a huff and had to be wooed back by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu. The incessant theme song of the festival's radio and television promotions has only irritated many Israelis. The slogan of the event, ""Together with pride, together with hope,"" spawned an impromptu contest on Army Radio for a rival theme. The winner: ""50-50,"" a slogan giving only even odds that the whole affair will succeed. ""Who's together?"" asked Asa Kasher, a commentator with the newspaper Maariv, who quickly ticked off a list of Jews and Jewish groups with whom he wants no association. Even the predominance of events in tendentious Jerusalem, instead of the more relaxed Tel Aviv, the main street of secular Israel, brought complaints. ""Shmueli moved the gala Independence Day concert to Jerusalem, where a large number of residents -- Palestinian Arabs and ultra-Orthodox Jews alike -- regard the anniversary of Israel's birth as a day of infamy,"" noted Jerusalem Report commentator Zeev Chafets. ""The people are not cheering the government's efforts to rouse their patriotic feelings,"" he said. ""They are laughing at them."" That is not to say Israelis won't enjoy the big party Thursday, or the bonus vacation day Friday. ""Israel needs the parades,"" said Mazalit Goldman, 20, a graphic design student in Jerusalem. ""Israel struggled so much to develop the country, so they have to show that Israel is strong."" ""It all seems exaggerated,"" said Nir Shuval, 25, owner of a peanut and candy stand at the Jerusalem Mall. ""It's nice to see what we've done in 50 years. But I don't know why it doesn't excite me."" The biggest controversy of the anniversary was taken with little humor. Israel Television commissioned a 22-part series on the history of the country, called ""Tkuma"" (Rebirth). But an episode dealing with the Palestinian conflict drew shrill cries of protest. Supporters say the episode took a scrupulous, even-handed approach, matching each scene of Israelis grieving after a terror attack with scenes of Palestinian grief at the hands of Israelis or interviews with Palestinians explaining what it meant to lose their homeland. But some in Israel did not see that as a fair accounting. ""Does Zionism really have to sit on the defendant's bench?"" protested Communications Minister Limor Livnat, who tried in vain to have it canceled. The director of the episode, Ronit Weiss-Berkowitz, said she received dozens of anonymous telephone death threats and hate calls because of the episode. ""Tkuma"" was the lightning rod for an ongoing process of reexamining Israel's history, a process accelerated by the anniversary. ""The Zionist ethos raised us all on the approach that there is only one reality, a black-and-white, sharp-and-clear picture, without any middling shades,"" said Rafi Man, an editor writing in Maariv. "" 'Tkuma' is our diploma: We are able to look at our past, to critically appraise it and to analyze what we did. There is nothing more scary than the truth."" But the main cause of Israel's antipathy toward its golden anniversary has more to do with the present than the past. Israel's strides in a half-century are impressive. But through the prism of today, those accomplishments seem burdened by problems, chief among them the continued rancor with the Palestinians who share the land and the attendant standoff with other Arab neighbors. ""We must advance the peace process and finish the conversation with Arafat,"" declared Israeli President Ezer Weizman in an interview with Maariv. That would be ""a great revolution. In 50 years, we learned how not to die. Now, for 50 years we should learn how to live."" For more than 2 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and close to 1 million Arab citizens of Israel -- nearly one-fifth of the country's total population, many of whom fled or were driven from their villages in wars with Israel -- this celebration is a slap in the face. ""Hundreds of villages were wiped out as a price for the current celebrations, yet not even one word is directed to the Palestinian people or the recognition of Palestinians' rights,"" noted an editorial in al-Quds, the leading Arabic newspaper in Jerusalem. Ahmed Tibi, an Arab Israeli citizen who also serves as an adviser to Arafat, explained his conflicted feelings. ""Israel, my state, is celebrating the 50th anniversary of its foundation; the Palestinians, my people, are mourning the 50th year of nakba, our national disaster,"" he wrote in the Jerusalem Report. ""In 1948, we and the Israelis entered a zero sum game. Everything the Israelis gained, the Palestinians lost."" But were the Palestinian issue to be settled, Israel still has a basket full of problems. It remains mired in southern Lebanon, its army suffering a slow hemorrhage there from attacks by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia. Internal disputes between religious and secular Israeli Jews, between the European and Asian or African Jews, between leftists and rightists are often waged in a nasty, uncompromising dialogue. And the booming growth of the economy in the mid-1990s has slowed to a crawl with unemployment at an unaccustomed high of 8.2 percent and growing. ""There is much more division in the air, a lot less of a feeling of togetherness,"" wrote Maariv commentator Hemi Shalev. ""We are much less tolerant and hate much more."" Mostly, he blames the economy: ""For each one of us it is becoming more and more difficult to ignore the tourists that disappeared, the stores that closed, the companies that went bankrupt. When there is a feeling of recession, everything looks bad."" Israel's preeminent novelist, Amos Oz, sighs, wearily acknowledging that the disputes were inevitable. ""Israel as conceived by the founding fathers and mothers was a naive wish,"" he wrote in the newspaper Haaretz this week. ""What resulted? A society of arguments. Sit in a cafe or get on a bus and you seem to hear more arguments than there are people. Everyone is shouting all the time. ""The new state was to be the most biblical, the most socialist, the most heroic, the most moral, the most aesthetic,"" he wrote. ""Obviously it was impossible to fulfill all these dreams. A few actually materialized. But even those that became flesh ultimately assumed the frayed, disenchanting shape of any dream that is fulfilled."" Special correspondent Ramit Plushnick in Jerusalem contributed to this report. When Israel declared independence in 1948, it represented only about 600,000 Jews -- many of them newly arrived refugees from postwar Europe -- and struggled for control of the land with its Arab neighbors. Today, it is the home of 5 million Jews and is by far the most prosperous and militarily powerful state in the Middle East, with an arsenal of nuclear weapons, an internationally competitive high-tech industry and living standards rivaling those of Western Europe. Still, permanent peace with the Palestinians and other Arabs remains elusive, and the society is deeply divided along religious, ethnic and political lines. 50 Years in Brief 1948: April 30: State of Israel is proclaimed by its Jewish leaders. Five Arab armies launch attack. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians flee, or are expelled, from areas that become Israel. 1967: June 5-10: Israel launches a preemptive strike against Egypt, Syria and Jordan. In Six-Day War, Israel captures Gaza Strip, Golan Heights, West Bank and east Jerusalem. Close to 1 million Palestinians come under Israeli military occupation, many flee. 1972: 11 Israeli athletes killed at Munich Olympic Games by terrorists of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, which embraces terrorism in its struggle against Israel. Between 1968 and the early 1980s, various Palestinian groups attack Jews and Israeli institutions around the world. 1973: Egypt and Syria launch surprise attack against Israel, making initial gains. Israel recoups, aided by massive U.S. arms airlift, but inconclusive war shatters its confidence. 1979: Israel and Egypt sign Camp David Accord, the first treaty between Israel and an Arab state. 1982: Israel invades Lebanon to crush the PLO; Palestinian guerrillas disperse around the Arab world, but Israeli troops become involved in a costly occupation. 1987: Dec. 8-9: Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza breaks out. Called the intifada, the revolt lasts six years and prompts a new search for peace. 1993: Sept. 13: In secret talks in Oslo, Norway, Israel and the PLO produce an interim framework accord for autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In first stage, Israel pulls out of most of the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area of the West Bank. 1994: Oct. 26: Jordan and Israel sign peace treaty calling for close economic and political cooperation. 1995: Nov. 4: Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin assassinated by a Jewish extremist opposed to principal of trading land for peace. 1996: May 29: Right-wing Likud leader Binjamin Netanyahu narrowly defeats Shimon Peres to become Israel's prime minister. Peace process slows. The people The first census taken in Israel in 1948 counted a total population of 716,700, including 156,000 non-Jews, mostly Arabs. By 1998, it was 5.8 million, including more than 800,000 Arabs. They inhabit a territory a bit smaller than Maryland. '98 -- 5.8 million Religious divisions While most Israelis are secular, the question of the place of religion in the state has not been answered. Tensions exist among secular, observant and orthodox Jews. Jews*: 80.5% Druze/other: 1.7% Christians: 3.2% Muslims: 14.6% *Estimates of the proportion of ultra-orthodox Jews range from 8% to 12%. Political divisions Thirteen parties are represented in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, which is one of the most contentious chambers anywhere. The parties range from leftist secular parties to parties representing Arabs, Russian immigrants and ultra-orthodox Jews.

About half a million arrived before independence and about 2.6 million between 1948 and 1996. They came in waves, Jews from Yemen in 1949, from Morocco in 1961, from the former Soviet Union beginning in 1990. Divisions persist among the majority European Jews, generally the most educated, known as Ashkenazi, the Jews from the Middle East, known as Sephardi, and others.

Today it is in the forefront of high-tech research and production. -- Israel's Matam Science Park near Haifa is the Silicon Valley of the Middle East, an internationally recognized center for research and technology. -- The number of high-tech start-up companies annually is second only to that in the United States. -- Intel, IBM, Microsoft, Digital and National Semiconductor all have research or manufacturing centers in Israel. -- The export of telecommunications equipment, an early Israeli high-tech field, doubled in the last three years to $ 2 billion. -- High-tech exports amount to about 30% of Israel's total industrial exports, which totaled $ 14.8 billion last year. A strong military Army, Air Force, Navy: 175,000 active 430,000 reserve Equipment: 4,300 main battle tanks, including Israeli-made Merkava. Air Force: More than 450 aircraft, including 205 F-16, 62 F-15, 50 F-4E and 20 Kfir. Navy: 21 missile-carrying craft Military expenditure decreased as the peace process got under way. Military expenditure as percentage of gross domestic product: A growing economy Israel has built a strong economy, and per capita income rivals that of Western Europeans. Income per person in thousands of dollars Income per person based on gross domestic product in 1996: France -- 21,100 Italy -- 20,000 Britain -- 19,600 Israel -- 17,400 Kuwait -- 16,200 Spain -- 15,100 Jordan -- 4,500 Lebanon -- 4,400 Egypt -- 4,000"12-Jul-98,,"When president Mobutu Sese Seko crashed from power last year in Congo, then known as Zaire, it seemed like the end of black Africa's class of the 1960s -- the Big Men who had seized power in the continent's newly independent states and ruled them like personal fiefdoms. But in this land of 5 million people, one member of the class is still in power. President Gnassingbe Eyadema has run Togo for 31 years -- making him sub-Saharan Africa's longest ruling leader -- and now claims a mandate for five more years after an election two weeks ago that many Togolese and foreign observers say he blatantly stole. Eyadema, 61, has dominated politics here since 1963, when he led West Africa's first military coup as a 26-year-old unemployed sergeant. His election victory -- which the State Department and the European Union have declared faulty but a Togolese court validated last week -- appeared to confirm that, amid Africa's post-Cold War evolution from authoritarian rule toward democracy, Eyadema retains a monopoly on state power in Togo. Yet under that surface, democratization is ""definitely taking hold in a slow, long process,"" a senior Western diplomat said. ""Up until 1990, you could say this was a dictatorship,"" said the diplomat, who spoke on condition he not be named. But in 1991, Togolese revolted with months of riots and strikes that forced Eyadema to allow a constitutional conference that shifted much of his power to a reformist prime minister. Still, Eyadema controlled the army, which he had packed with loyalists from his own northern ethnic group, the Kabre. Troops eventually stormed the prime minister's residence and hauled him, a prisoner, to Eyadema for ""negotiations"" that restored much of the president's power. When opposition parties narrowly won control of the new parliament in a 1994 vote described as fair by international observers, the Supreme Court ordered three opposition seats contested again. Eyadema's party swept them to regain a bare majority through what opposition parties and Togolese journalists said was electoral fraud. While Eyadema has retaken the machinery of state, Togolese continue to oppose him in a way ""that would have gotten them killed in [Eyadema's] early years,"" the Western diplomat said. With the emergence of ""a relatively free press that criticizes Eyadema,"" plus opposition parties and other civic bodies, ""now this country is a pre-democratic society,"" he said. This year, with his government strapped for cash -- and all major donors but France having halted aid years ago over Togo's repression and human rights abuse -- Eyadema promised a fair election, something donors demanded before resuming assistance. He accepted a joint government-opposition commission to monitor how his internal security minister, Gen. Seyi Memene, conducted the vote. He set up a commission to ensure that all six presidential candidates got fair coverage in the state media. But in the end, those moves appeared hollow. Media coverage remained skewed in Eyadema's favor, according to Togolese citizens and Reporters Without Borders, a Paris-based media monitoring group. And when initial, unofficial voting returns showed Eyadema at risk of losing, government representatives on the joint election commission quit; and the counting was resumed, election observers say, in private by Memene. In an interview, Eyadema said Memene's count had been witnessed by a judge, but neither the president nor his foreign minister could recall the judge's name. When Memene announced Eyadema's victory on June 24 -- with 52 percent of the vote, just enough to avoid a runoff against his top opponent -- Lome erupted in protests. Crowds marched, shouting ""Eyadema, thief!"" and rioters burned tires and stoned policemen. Within the cocoon of Eyadema's official residence, there was no hint of such events. One morning soon after his proclaimed victory, Eyadema was jovial, greeting a visiting journalist affably and calling to a uniformed servant, ""Let's have some champagne!"" Eyadema receives numerous visitors each day and is known for his champagne hospitality. Tables in a corner of his office held 10 bottles, plus trays of tall flutes of elaborately cut glass, each bearing his initials in gold. On their bases, little plastic manufacturers' labels read: ""St. Louis -- France."" For an hour, sipping two glasses of champagne and a cognac, Eyadema said he has been badly misrepresented as a corrupt authoritarian clinging to power. He repeated the account of his official biography, which omits the two military coups that brought him to office, saying only that in 1967, ""Eyadema accepted, in accord with the will of the people, to be made head of state."" Eyadema walks with a limp and suffers declining eyesight, but is still as tall and husky as when he was growing up in a farming family in the impoverished northern region of Togo, which was then under French rule. His parents named him Etienne, but he discarded the name in the 1970s when, like Zaire's Mobutu, he ordered his people to Africanize names and cultural practices. After primary school, Eyadema joined the French army, which sent him and other Togolese to fight its colonial wars in Indochina and Algeria. In 1963, Eyadema and about 300 other soldiers, most from the poorer north, recently had returned to newly independent Togo. They asked the new president, a wealthy southern businessman named Sylvanus Olympio, to hire them into Togo's 250-man army. Olympio ""treated us like mercenaries, saying we had killed our Indochinese and Algerian brothers,"" Eyadema said. Eyadema and a few others organized a coup, went to Olympio's house -- adjacent to the U.S. Embassy -- and killed him. For years, Eyadema said he personally had killed Olympio. He stopped making the claim in about 1990, but Samuel DeCalo, a Florida-based political scientist and specialist on Togo, said U.S. Embassy cables from 1963 support that account. Eyadema helped install a northerner as president and soon after became army chief. He took power himself in a 1967 coup and set up a single-party government that repressed dissent. Amid the Cold War, with socialist governments in Benin to the east and Ghana to the west, Eyadema won easy support from Western powers, especially France. He built the army as his pillar of power. Togo's army is led by ""one of the most [ethnically] highly concentrated groups"" of officers, DeCalo said. About 90 percent are from Eyadema's Kabre ethnic group, according to the State Department's latest human rights report on Togo -- and a high percentage from Eyadema's village, Pya, DeCalo said. In his office, Eyadema said northerners dominate the army because ""northerners are more courageous than the people of the south."" Southerners, most of whom are from the Ewe ethnic group, ""fear being killed,"" he said, laughing. He pointed at Foreign Minister Koffi Panou, sitting on an adjacent couch, and said, ""He's a southerner. He knows!"" Panou grinned and laughed along. For years, Eyadema won praise for helping Togo's economy grow quickly, largely on the basis of phosphate exports, and Eyadema spoke glowingly of building ""the Switzerland of Africa."" In 1967, he said, ""there were only two high schools in Togo."" After his 31 years of rule, ""you can't count them. There are more than 50."" Critics say Togo's poverty is rooted in heavy debt first contracted in the 1970s, plus the 1980s collapse in the phosphate price. But Eyadema said it was the opposition, during its brief grip on power, that squandered Togolese foreign currency reserves. ""They stole money . . . and built villas and bought cars with it,"" he said. Then why had Eyadema not prosecuted them? ""How can we?"" he responded.

President Daniel arap Moi suspended the official, John Harun Mwau, on Wednesday, just four days after Mr. Mwau had filed charges against four high-ranking Treasury Department officials, accusing them of a scheme to evade $3.9 million in import duties on wheat and sugar. The President's actions came after the Finance Minister, Simeon Nyachae, in a spirited defense of his accused subordinates, attacked Mr. Mwau in public, accusing him of starting a witch hunt. He defended the officials, who are accused of corrupt business dealings, maintaining that not only did they act within the law, but with the full approval of the Cabinet. Played out on the front pages of newspapers here, the disagreement has undermined the credibility of Mr. Moi's efforts to stamp out corruption, once again putting Kenya's shaky relations with international lenders in jeopardy. ""This is not helpful,"" said one diplomat, insisting on anonymity. ""This is an unfortunate development, distracting from the central issues this country faces. This is all a distraction, a sideshow."" When the International Monetary Fund suspended aid to Kenya last year, one of its principal complaints was that the Government had done little or nothing to rein in rampant official corruption. In recent years, corrupt schemes have seeped into almost every level of government here, from bribes that traffic officers solicit from motorists to elaborate land grabs and import-duty scams involving cabinet members, diplomats say. In response to pressure from the I.M.F., Mr. Moi set up the Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority last December and put Mr. Mwau, a former police officer and an opposition gadfly, in charge. But Mr. Mwau's decision to prosecute the four treasury officials as his first high-profile case has raised questions about his sincerity and the viability of his authority, diplomats and financial officials said. Before the charges were leveled, the four accused officials were seen as part of a progressive, reform-minded wing of the governing party, a group led by Mr. Nyachae that stands firmly behind efforts to stamp out corruption. While diplomats and officials at international lending institutions said they could not say whether the charges were true, they did say they came as a surprise. ""We have a feeling that these people who were to be arrested were doing their jobs and we have no reason to believe they were corrupt,"" one banking official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Whether or not the charges are true, several diplomats said the public contretemps was not likely to persuade the I.M.F. and World Bank to resume aid to shore up Kenya's shattered economy, which is reeling from a steep drop in tourism. On the streets of the capital, meanwhile, speculation has grown that Mr. Mwau purposely took aim at pro-reform officials first, instead of other officials suspected of corruption in order to take the wind out of the pro-reform movement's sails. A cartoon in Wednesday's Daily Nation newspaper showed Mr. Mwau and Mr. Nyachae as puppets, their strings being pulled by hands recognizable as the President's. A statement from the President's office said Mr. Moi would appoint a tribunal to ""inquire into the proper performance"" of the corruption authority. The statement said Mr. Mwau would be suspended until the tribunal had finished its inquiry. For his part, Mr. Mwau has fiercely defended the charges against the four officials and has said he will resign if they are not proved true in court. It is highly unlikely the case will ever be heard, however, since the Attorney General has dropped the charges. The accused officials are Joseph Kinyua, Njeru Kirira, John Msafari and Samuel Chebii. At the same time, Mr. Nyachae has accused Mr. Mwau of pressing the charges only to divert attention from the fact that he himself is under investigation by the Kenya Revenue Authority for evading duty on the import of automobile tires. Mr. Mwau denies any wrongdoing."26-Sep-99,,"The failure of the United Nations to prevent bloodshed in East Timor, despite clear warnings from officials inside and outside the organization, is reigniting a debate about whether the world body is equipped to deal with urgent humanitarian crises, particularly inside the borders of sovereign states. At the U.N. General Assembly last week, Secretary General Kofi Annan called for even greater U.N. involvement in conflicts within national borders, saying that state sovereignty ""is being redefined."" President Clinton reaffirmed his own interventionist impulse. ""When we are faced with deliberate, organized campaigns to murder whole peoples or expel them from their land, the care of victims is important, but not enough,"" he said. Yet many doubt whether the United Nations can adapt, or whether key member countries such as the United States want it to adapt, to meet these new demands and expectations. In responding to the crisis in East Timor -- just as in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Kosovo -- the world body was hamstrung by the absence of a standing U.N. military force, schisms in a Security Council where five nations have veto power, a shortage of funds, and the plodding, insulated and overly deferential dynamics of the 185-member organization. The disaster in East Timor is a case study of the organization's problems, and it raises tough questions for the Clinton doctrine of humanitarian-driven interventionism. On the eve of signing an agreement with Indonesia in early May to allow an independence referendum in the territory of East Timor, several senior U.N. officials were full of apprehension rather than joy. True, the referendum would let the East Timorese decide their fate, 24 years after Indonesia occupied the former Portuguese colony, and Annan would call the May 5 signing ""an historic moment."" But the Indonesian government had scratched out sections in the original U.N. draft that demanded the disarming of anti-independence militias and the confining of Indonesian soldiers to barracks. The Indonesian foreign ministry also had rejected an April 30 letter from Annan that tried to get Indonesian President B.J. Habibie's personal commitment to security guarantees during the referendum. And top Indonesian military officers had refused to meet a negotiating team sent by Annan in April. ""I cannot hide my apprehensions regarding the course on which we are about to embark,"" one senior U.N. official wrote in an internal memorandum just before the signing. Citing the possibility of intimidation, vote rigging and violence, he wrote: ""Apart from the moral opprobrium that would be heaped on the U.N. were we to follow such a course, the consequences for the long-term stability of East Timor would be disastrous. Will any of our 'friends' come to redeem our reputation? I somewhat doubt it."" Four months later, those words seem prophetic. East Timor's capital, Dili, lies in ruins, and the United Nations' reputation is badly bruised. Early this month, as militias rampaged in Dili, Nobel Peace Prize co-winner and East Timor independence leader Jose Ramos-Horta said, ""I don't see how people around the world can trust the United Nations again."" East Timor had been widely ignored since Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975. Although the United Nations condemned the annexation at the time, few major powers -- especially the United States -- were ready for a showdown over it. But the issue festered. A small guerrilla group fighting for independence became a persistent nuisance, and the awarding of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize to two East Timor leaders focused attention on the territory. The door to independence opened in January this year, when Habibie, who succeeded the longtime authoritarian leader Suharto in 1998, announced that he would let East Timor choose between independence and autonomy within Indonesia. At the United Nations, Habibie's offer was seen as a ""window of opportunity"" that could soon slam shut, said a senior diplomat in New York. With Indonesian elections scheduled for September (now October), no one knew who might replace Habibie and what that person's attitude would be toward East Timor. There was an odd, anachronistic element in the negotiations that followed Habibie's offer: The talks were held between Indonesia and East Timor's former colonial ruler, Portugal. Other countries, including the United States, Japan and Australia, had more bargaining power in Jakarta. But bargaining with Portugal suited Indonesia, and the United Nations, with its respect for historical decolonization formulas, accepted the role of mediator between the two, diplomats said. Despite Habibie's offer, it was unclear how sincere Indonesia was and whether its military would carry out an agreement on East Timor. In April, army-backed militiamen killed more than 45 refugees seeking refuge in a church compound. When U.N. negotiators pushed for a peace commission that would include two bishops, pro-independence parties, anti-independence militias, Indonesian military and U.N. forces, Indonesian Defense Minister Wiranto set up his own commission without U.N. involvement. U.N. officials feared that Indonesia would try to intimidate voters, then contest referendum results if they were close. Because the draft agreement gave responsibility to Indonesia for security, the United Nations wanted assurances. On April 30, Annan sent his letter to Habibie and had it rejected. On May 4, he sent Indonesia a memorandum laying out ""necessary security conditions."" He got no reply, diplomatic sources said. It was an awkward moment. NATO was in the middle of its war over Kosovo. The United States had been content to take a supporting role, and Portugal ""feared that if this [referendum] didn't happen before Habibie left office, it would never happen,"" U.N. diplomats said. On May 5, Annan, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and Jaime Gama, Portugal's minister of foreign affairs, signed the accord. ""Alatas took Portugal to the cleaners,"" said one diplomat familiar with the negotiations. Stanley Roth, U.S. assistant secretary of state for Asia, was the U.S. point person on East Timor. He has made 13 trips to Indonesia in two years. But a senior U.S. official said Roth wasn't at the table in the talks with Indonesia, and the Clinton administration was appalled that the agreement excluded U.N. peacekeepers and provided for just 300 civilian police and 50 unarmed U.N. military liaison officers. ""There was a great desire to get this issue off the agenda, and [the United Nations] saw in Habibie's proposal a way to do that,"" said Adam Schwarz, an expert on Indonesia at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. ""The problem is, they were not asking the hard questions about whether this was workable."" ""Let me say the United Nations was not naive about the history of violence in East Timor during the past 24 years,"" Annan said this month. But ""nobody in their wildest dreams thought what we are witnessing could have happened."" He added, ""We are no fools."" Immediately after the May 5 agreement, the militias stepped up their campaign of intimidation. The United States and Australia persuaded Indonesia to let the civilian police and U.N. liaison officers carry light sidearms. Even as violence increased, Indonesia, the world's largest Islamic country and former head of the movement of non-aligned nations, got diplomatic support. U.N. Security Council supporters included the tiny African nations of Gambia and Gabon; Bahrain, a leader in the non-aligned movement; Malaysia; and Russia. Japan, one diplomat said, ""would look for the silver lining in any cloud."" Officials from the world body and five countries -- the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Japan -- began meeting weekly in May to plan a peacekeeping operation that would keep order after Indonesia's anticipated withdrawal from the territory in November. They also discussed evacuation plans in case violence forced the sudden departure of U.N. personnel and other foreigners. But before the referendum, no one did any planning for a multinational intervention force capable of stopping possible militia violence. ""You can't go to the [Security] Council and say, 'We think Indonesia is going to implement a scorched-earth policy and we need a policy of foreign intervention now,' "" said a diplomat familiar with the planning. ""The politics of the council are such that you can't paint a worst-case scenario."" Instead, diplomacy was wielded to try to persuade Indonesia to keep order. Among others, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Ralston, spoke to Gen. Wiranto a number of times, stressing the need to maintain order. Nonetheless, by the Aug. 30 vote some 10,000 militia members, including 2,000 heavily armed irregulars, had flooded East Timor, according to U.S. estimates. Hours before the final vote count was announced, Canada's ambassador to the United Nations, Robert Fowler, voiced concern about post-ballot violence and asked whether there were contingency plans to stop it. ""Nobody wanted to talk about it,"" said a diplomat present at the meeting. On Sept. 3, the referendum results were announced: 78.5 percent of East Timorese had voted for independence. Militias went on a rampage. Within three days, more than 200,000 people -- a quarter of East Timor's population -- were driven from their homes and hundreds were killed while Annan, Clinton and others urged Indonesia to restore order. In the United States, there were divided views on how to aid the East Timorese. With U.S. forces taxed by Kosovo and other peacekeeping commitments, Pentagon and National Security Council officials resisted yet another foreign military effort. ""People always understood things could go badly,"" a senior Pentagon official said. ""But under the circumstances, we felt it would be much better if there were an Asian face on this."" Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright favored U.S. support for an Australian-led international force. A senior U.S. diplomat said American support for the operation was influenced by memories of massacres in Bosnia, and by the realization that the Indonesian army was ""not the solution, they were the problem."" He said, ""Everyone was thinking we've got another Yugoslavia on our hands."" After a week of threats from the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, United Nations and Washington, Indonesia agreed to allow an international force to restore order. Some U.N. officials have since asked themselves whether Annan should have postponed the referendum, as he was able to under the May 5 agreement. U.N. diplomats answer that Xanana Gusmao, the East Timorese leader under house arrest; Ramos-Horta; and Constancio Pinto, a former guerrilla fighter who represents East Timor at the United Nations, all favored proceeding. The New York diplomat also said that many people misread Indonesia's intentions, including U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia Stapleton Roy. When the military pulled out troops and replaced its East Timor commander, many analysts thought that meant the military was accepting independence. Few believed that Indonesia would risk billions of dollars in foreign investment and IMF loans by launching a scorched-earth policy in plain view of international observers. ""There was some real hope about it working out right up to the time the vote was announced and all hell broke loose,"" said a senior U.S. official.  Staff writer Bradley Graham contributed to this report."
