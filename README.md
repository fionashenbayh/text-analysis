# text-analysis

This Python tutorial demonstrates how to run two kinds of topic models, Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Non-negative Matrix Factorization. It uses a corpus of news documents downloaded from LexisNexis Academic. The documents cover corruption in sub-Saharan AFrica and come from both Western and African news sources.
