The often-used explanation for the rampant corruption being a result of an ""it's our time to eat"" mentality by the new black elite is far from the full story. On Sunday we learnt that a dozen or more top leaders in the construction industry had been rigging tender bids, fixing prices and paying and receiving kickbacks for more than a decade. It meant, among other things, that the taxpayer paid inflated prices for public projects such as soccer stadiums and the Gautrain. The billions the state had overpaid should have been spent on housing, health, education and job creation. Some of the men implicated in the cartel (they have names like Saxby, Macdonald, Meyburgh and Ackerman) were paid salaries of around R500 000 a month. I have good reason to believe that the affidavits made by some of the conspirators to the Hawks were leaked to deflect attention from the absolute scandal that is the public spending at President Jacob Zuma's private mansions at Nkandla and the government's half-truths about it. We should not allow this tactic to succeed. We should keep up the pressure on both issues. What is the difference between Zuma allowing hundreds of millions of taxpayers' money to be spent on his property and the construction industry defrauding the state? Only the amounts involved, really. In both instances public money that could have been spent on the poor is used for a few individuals. Wait, there is a difference. The conspirators in the construction cartel are going to be prosecuted, possibly sent to jail and their companies will get huge fines. Zuma insists he hasn't done anything wrong and, despite evidence to the contrary, says he knew nothing about the improvements to his billionaire estate. It is clear this government and business leaders will not pull out all the stops to stop the corruption wave undermining our national life and economy. It is a task civil society will have to spearhead. The problem is that we have become immune to corruption shocks. We have corruption fatigue. We are gatvol and just go on with life instead of being outraged and doing something. The media remain the main arrow in our arsenal to fight corrupt politicians and business people. They are assisted by a few activist bodies such as Corruption Watch. But we need a lot more activism to make a dent. We need committed individuals to buy a share or two in businesses and corporations and stand up at shareholder meetings and confront management. We need more whistle-blowers in the private and public sectors to expose corruption and we need to rally behind them when they're victimised. They are heroes, and we should honour and protect them. We need ordinary good members of the ANC, the SACP and Cosatu to stand up and refuse to accept the blank denials or glib explanations from the government, using culture, race and history as excuses. We should make sure no act of corruption goes unpunished. The problem is there is good reason to suspect that our first citizen is getting away scot-free from charges of corruption, fraud and racketeering. Just take this weekend's revelations in the newspapers. Did presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj and/or his wife get a kickback paid into a Swiss account after a rigged tender as the Mail and Guardian reported? Did Communications Minister Dina Pule's boyfriend pocket R6 million |irregularly after an event organised by her department, as the Sunday Times reported? Did Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi lie about the improvements to Nkandla only being for security while a tuckshop for one of Zuma's wives was also built with public money, as the City Press alleged? Will any of the above individuals be sanctioned if the allegations are proved? Probably not. Will we have forgotten about it in a few weeks' time? Probably. We should start by being unforgiving even about small lies, lies told as part of party politicking, because that's where dishonesty starts. For example, when trade unionists threaten hellfire if farmworkers don't get R150 a day while they live in luxury and pay their own workers much less, we should protest loudly. The thorough grilling Helen Zille got after receiving money from the Gupta family showed the way. Can we now apply the same aggression and relentlessness when we confront other politicians?"3,South African Official News,8/2/2012,Heat turned up against corruption in fisheries sector,,PAKISTAN (79%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%) ,,Newswire,,ENGLISH,,14-Aug-13,"CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA (77%) Cape Town",430  words,CORRUPTION (92%); AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS (90%); FISHERIES ADMINISTRATION (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); FISHERIES (90%); AUDITS (90%); ANIMAL POACHING & TRAFFICKING (78%); FORENSICS (78%); MARINE RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (78%); ACCOUNTING (77%); TALKS & MEETINGS (72%); DISMISSALS (70%); COASTAL AREAS (60%),"The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is determined to root out corruption within its ranks and to that end, the police have tasked an internationally recognised auditing firm to conduct a forensic audit of the fisheries branch after a preliminary investigation uncovered evidence of corruption. Briefing media in Parliament on Wednesday, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson said the findings from the preliminary investigation could implicate some officials in the department, with corruption evident in the allocation of quotas, transfer of rights and preferential treatment given to certain businesses. Joemat-Pettersson, who declined to name the company as she had not been cleared by police to do so, was due to present a more detailed briefing to her fellow Cabinet members on the corruption findings at the fortnightly Cabinet meeting on Wednesday. She said the investigations were being conducted into all types of corruption in the department, but that the initial probe had indicated there was corruption centred on abalone. ""We are determined to root out corruption. We will not hesitate to act against any official who is implicated in any way in any corrupt practice."" The minister said since preliminary investigations began, her office has had to respond to weekly allegations from officials claiming that she was going to fire them. Joemat-Pettersson said some allegations had also been made about her as a person, pointing out that if these were true, people must bring evidence to back these up. Joemat-Pettersson said the department would now add further measures to secure the department's information and ensure the safety of staff. Last week, following increased surveillance by police and other officials, over 30 436 units of abalone were confiscated, leading to seven arrests in five different incidences of illegal poaching. Joemat-Pettersson commended community members and officials in her department who had helped expose poaching activities and encouraged South Africans both inside and outside her department to come forward if they had other information around poaching. The arrests last week include two arrests made in Riviersonderend last Friday and the confiscation of 3 806 abalone. Joemat-Pettersson said the department was busy calculating the cost to the economy of the confiscated abalone. However, she said she was concerned because the proceeds of confiscated abalone were awarded to Marine and Coastal Management, and therefore it was crucial to secure arrests before abalone is removed from the sea."4,South African Official News,8/8/2012,Anti-Corruption Task Team raids Auction Alliance properties,,PAKISTAN (65%); SOUTH AFRICA (55%) ,,Newswire,,ENGLISH,,14-Aug-13,"PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA (54%) Pretoria",110  words,CORRUPTION (92%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); SEARCH & SEIZURE (88%); ARRESTS (85%),"The Anti-Corruption Task Team raided 13 properties owned by Auction Alliance across the country on Tuesday.

Speaking at the opening of the two-day Provincial Anti-Corruption Round table discussion that commenced in Potchefstroom on Thursday, Premier Modise vowed that her administration will intensify its fight against corrupt elite networks in order to win the battle against greed and corruption. ""It is highly disappointing that scandals involving public officials are common in the South Africa.Everyday people are debating and complaining about outright corruption, lack of ethics, transparency, integrity and unprofessional behavior in government. Corruption has become so rampant throughout the world, not just in South Africa but both public and private sectors throughout the world are faced with the challenge of eliminating bribery and corruption,"" she stressed. Premier Modise urged delegates to continue encouraging everyone to be aware of corruption in all sectors as it has the potential of threatening the country's integrity. Premier Modise said that the provincial government has put in place strategies to root out corruption by recommitting itself to uphold and implement the programme of action of the Provincial Anti-Corruption Forum. She said the forum emphasises among others the promotion of strong governance structures, sound financial management practices and internal controls, competent workforce and prevention of collusion particularly between the public and private civil sector officials. She also called on all delegates to help in building the culture of integrity in all sectors of society, including communities, families and individuals. Many presenters at the conference supported Chairperson of the Moral Regeneration Movement, Father Smangaliso Mkhatshwa's call for reclaim of values and united civic action. They called for intensified advocacy and protection of whistle blower. The Public Service Commission commended the province for having the only functional Anti-Corruption Forum in the country. Addressing the conference, Commissioner Selinah Nkosi commended the Office of the Premier for establishing the Provincial Anti-Corruption Unit,a dedicated Hotline, Risk Management and the Forensic Unit and  for putting  in place mechanisms to prevent, detect and investigate corruption. ""The Office of the Premier is leading by example with 100% compliance in financial disclosures for the 2011/2012 financial year.

Speaking in Nyongane near Hazyview yesterday (Saturday, 18 August 2012) where he handed over four sponsored houses to impoverished beneficiaries, Premier Mabuza described the arrests as ""a good step"" in the right direction. ""We welcome the move by the Hawks, this is taking us into closing this chapter since this matter has been there for a very long time. We are not saying those who are arrested are guilty, but at least this will help all of us to know if there were irregularities or not. ""There have been serious speculations around it and the people out there have a right to know if really there was corruption or not. Therefore we believe that with this move, at least the truth will prevail, and that there will be closure to this matter,"" said Mabuza. He urged the citizens to allow the law to take its due processes. Speaking about the sponsored houses, the Premier acknowledged the efforts by local community structures that donated and built the houses adding that they displayed ""personal care"" for each other. Mabuza thanked the structures saying he understood they also had problems, but it was encouraging that they left their problems and helped others. He conceded that although the provincial government had done well in delivering houses, there was still a huge backlog. ""We have done well in housing the people in the former townships, our focus now is in the peri-urban areas, hence the introduction of the Comprehensive Rural Development Programme projects. ""We have many people on waiting lists because the processes we use to compile these lists are very complex and full of flaws. We need to come closer and assist the department of human settlement to ensure that people who are on the waiting lists are guaranteed houses,"" said the Premier. He said there should be one genuine, valid list and that there should be no favouritism. He said it was disturbing that some councillorsprioritised the youth in allocating the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) houses instead of the elderly people who were living on collapsing old rusty shacks and mud houses. The Premier also urged the people in the province to be patient and not invade land as it has been the case in Barberton and Nelspruit recently. ""It is wrong to invade land, it makes our work as government very cumbersome because once that has been done, there will be a need to urgently put infrastructure in those areas. ""While government would be working on servicing that land, people would on the other hand going to the streets to demand services when such had not been planned for the invaded land,"" he said. He requested the people to work closely with municipalities in ensuring that they were settled in serviced lands in order to avoid un-necessary hostility between them and municipalities. After identifying five other beneficiaries for sponsored houses in Clau-Clau, Zwelisha and Ngodini, the Premier told the community not to destroy the councillors' houses whenever they were frustrated. He said it was high time that communities understood that leaders should be ""groomed"" and be prepared for leadership positions. ""We must understand that leaders do not fall from the sky, it is our responsibility as communities to mentor the people we want to lead us, and when we are dissatisfied with their leadership styles, we should unanimously remove them and put other people instead of burning their houses. ""We must be united as a community and guide our leaders on how they should lead us,"" concluded Mabuza."7,South African Official News,10/1/2012,"Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries forensic investigation confirms multi-billion rand corruption in vessel management by Smit Amandla Marine Servicees Pty LTD",,SOUTH AFRICA (92%); PAKISTAN (79%) ,,Newswire,,ENGLISH,,14-Aug-13,,908  words,FORENSICS (91%); AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS (90%); AGRICULTURE  FORESTRY & FISHING LAW (90%); EVIDENCE (90%); FISHERIES ADMINISTRATION (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); FISHERIES (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); CONTRACT AWARDS (90%); PUBLIC FINANCE (90%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (90%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (89%); PURCHASING & PROCUREMENT (78%); TREASURY DEPARTMENTS (77%); TAX LAW (75%); VALUE ADDED TAX (75%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (74%); MAINTENANCE & REPAIR (50%),"The Ernest & Young forensic report confirmed substantial evidence of irregular contracts awarded to Smit Amandla Marine (SAM) or different guises thereof since 1995 until 31 March 2012. The acting Director-General (DG) of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF), Sipho Ntombela, has received the forensic report on the investigation, commissioned to probe procurement processes and systems in the Fisheries Branch of DAFF, today. The report reveals amongst others that the agreement concluded in 2005 and subsequent extensions, between SAM and the department failed to comply with the tender board regulations, with departmental procurement policies, National Treasury Regulations, income tax regulations and also the Public Finance Management Act. As an example, there was a contract extension entered into worth millions of rands by mere letter without any proof of any tender process followed or supporting documentation. For instance, the contracts signed, particularly those signed in 2000, 2005 and 2010 were irregular and were deliberately drafted to have maximum benefit for SAM amounting to approximately R1.6 - R2 billion. The State had no protection in any of these contracts and the available evidence suggests complicity and corruption between government officials and SAM. Smit International is a Dutch multinational with South African subsidiaries. The current SAM, South African subsidiaries are Smit Amandla Marine, which was formerly called Smit Marine and Pentow Marine. In all of these guises these Smit companies had the contract for the maintenance and repair of the government fleet lease from 2000 - 2012. Further investigation revealed that they may even have had the contract since 1995 until 2000. This is being verified by further forensic analysis. These extensions also exceeded the required number of years for open tenders and were without any specified contract price. This gave rise to substantial expenditure running into millions of rands which is and was highly irregular in terms of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA). In some instances, contracts were entered into as extensions running into millions of rands even though the service had little to do with the prior terms of contract. This should have necessitated an entirely new tender process. It also emerged that the terms of payment were amended. Previously SAM was paid in arrears for services rendered, but subsequently, they were paid in advance for services not yet rendered. This confirms the high level of complicity with officials in the Fisheries Branch. The evidence indicates that the state was defrauded to the extent of approximately R1.6 billion which includes invoices of duplicate payments, invoices without tax or VAT. Invoices worth up to R600 million have recently been uncovered hidden away from the investigators and could indicate more extensive defrauding of the state. Furthermore, payments were made to SAM as recently as after the termination of the contract after March 2012. There is also substainal evidence that multiple government departments were asked to make payment, for example, where a contract is entered into with one government department, invoices and payment are made by other government departments in violation of the of the PFMA. In some instances the state was levied with amounts worth tens of millions at a time of which there is no evidence of SAM having provided any service to the state. There are instances where monies owing by SAM to the state have been deliberately withheld with the assistance of complicit state officials in the Fisheries Branch. All of the above evidence has necessitated that the forensic audit investigation be expanded to include the period to 2000 for further evaluation of documentation. That would include servers and computers and the engagement of senior officials involved in all of these contracts. This is substantial evidence of the unlawful defrauding of the state. Evidence against SAM and officials in Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) and DAFF is overwhelming, indicating wide spread complicity, corruption, deliberate entering of contracts unfavourable to the state. In addition, there is total disregard for Treasury Regulations and procurement processes and attempt to hide this information from investigations in the last few months. There has been a concerted effort by the parties associated with SAM to prevent DAFF and the forensic investigators from finding this evidence. Ernst & Young discovered documentation was moved to warehouses in Paarden Eiland. Together with the law enforcement agents, they were able to prevent the destruction of valuable data and contracts from government systems and computers. The SAM contract was entered into by the previous Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism and was given to Pentow Marine and Smit Marine. Despite this, there appears to be no evidence of a valid agreement between the then Department and Smit Marine. The DAFF only took over the contract from 2011 from the DEA and all prior agreements were concluded by the former department. Available evidence also indicates that National Treasury and PFMA regulations were flouted in the awarding of the irregular extension of the contract. Mr Ntombela will present the content of the report to Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson tomorrow morning and will then brief the media at 10h00 at Imbizo Media Centre, Parliamentary Precinct."8,South African Official News,11/16/2012,Gauteng Provincial Government gets tough on fraud and corruption,,PAKISTAN (79%) ,,Newswire,,ENGLISH,,14-Aug-13,,971  words,CORRUPTION (93%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (92%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); TREASURY DEPARTMENTS (89%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); CIVIL SERVICES (78%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (77%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (76%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (74%); HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT (74%); SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT (73%); ECONOMIC NEWS (73%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (71%); WAGES & SALARIES (69%); RURAL DEVELOPMENT (69%); AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS (66%); WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION (51%),"On behalf of the Gauteng Provincial Treasury, and indeed the rest of the Gauteng Provincial Government (GPG), I extend a warm welcome to you all. We are proud to host Gauteng's first International Fraud Awareness Seminar. This event forms part of the International Fraud Awareness Week, which is the initiative of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners that runs from the 12th to the 17th of this month. International research has proven that fraud is prevalent both in the public and private sector. As a result organisations around the world lose an estimated 5% of their annual revenue to fraud. We are in this together, that is why there is a need for the public and private sector to work very closely to develop and implement strategies aimed at combating this challenge. Our participation in this gathering reaffirms our outmost commitment to fighting fraud and corruption. We cannot allow some amongst us to operate with impunity. Our efforts are guided by the Gauteng Anti-Corruption Strategic Framework, which makes provision for, amongst other things, that all reported cases of corruption are fully investigated and maximum penalties are applied to perpetrators, blacklisting of corrupt officials and service providers, the establishment of a centralised electronic database of cases of fraud and corruption and provision of whistle-blower protection services to public servants and the public. Implementation of the anti-fraud strategy gaining momentum The implementation of the provincial government anti-fraud and corruption strategy is progressing as planned. In the next few weeks the Gauteng Provincial Treasury will embark on a process to verify all employees of the provincial government to ensure that salaries are paid to authentic employees. This process will enable us to maintain the accuracy of the payroll system, match bank account details with authentic officials and detect and prevent any fraudulent transactions. In this way we will improve the efficiency in the management of our human capital, maximize production and avoid over expenditure. The implementation of this project will start with the Gauteng Provincial Treasury, followed by the Gauteng Department of Finance and then the Gauteng Department of Health, before it is rolled out to the entire provincial. In June this year, we announced that the process of procuring goods and services is being tightened. This is precisely because fraud manifests itself in supply chain management processes. In this regard we have engaged the State Security Agency to conduct a thorough vetting process of all supply chain management officials in the provincial government. This is already underway and officials in Department of Community Safety, Department of Economic Development, Office of the Premier, Gauteng Provincial Treasury, Gauteng Department of Finance, Gauteng Department of Agriculture Rural Development and the Gauteng Department of Sports, Arts, Culture and Recreation have already been vetted. Boosting investigative capacity to achieve results In the first six months of this financial year, Gauteng received a total of 42 cases of alleged fraud and corruption through the National Anti-Corruption Hotline, 30 of these cases were reported in the second quarter. These cases ranged from corruption, fraud, procurement irregularities, misappropriation of funds, unethical behaviour, reckless driving, appointment irregularities and theft. In an effort to eliminate backlog and increase the rate of case resolution in the province, 70 officials are undergoing advanced investigation training. This is intended to, amongst others, provide the principles / procedures of forensic investigation and establish in-depth knowledge of specific investigation techniques and methods. We want to see action be taken against those who will be found guilty, even if people need to be criminally charged and prosecuted. Our view is that this will send a strong message that fraud and corruption will not be tolerated under any circumstances, no matter the status and position of the person involved. As we have said before, we must be aggressive and go after those who operate with impunity and pillage the resources of the state. Indeed the net is tightening for those who continue to plunder public resources. Over the past three years many employees and service providers either lost their jobs, were criminally charged or blacklisted after being found guilty of fraud and corruption in the provincial government: Finance official at the Gauteng Department of Agriculture and Rural Development was dismissed for making deliberate duplicate payments to a service provider. A service provider was blacklisted by the Gauteng Department of Finance for tender irregularities, a letter has been dispatched to National Treasury. A finance practitioner at the Gauteng Department of Finance was arrested and dismissed for fraudulent use of GPG employees personal details to obtain loans, credit cards and mortgage bonds. A human resource team leader at the Gauteng Department of Finance was arrested and dismissed for appointing ghost teachers whose salaries were paid to his syndicate. These and many other cases demonstrate our commitment to fight fraud and corruption decisively: But we need to do more. That is why we are also prioritising the following: Lack of proper management systems to monitor or deal with corruption e.g. nepotism both in the local government institutions and the provincial government departments. Staff's lack of knowledge and awareness about corruption and its manifestations. Individual units not working as teams across departments and municipalities. Lack of cooperation with other sectors - business and civil society. Departments do not have capacity to deal effectively with cases referred from the National Anti-Corruption Hotline."9,South African Official News,11/21/2012,MEC Nono Maloyi to launch the Anti-Fraud and Corruption Strategy,,PAKISTAN (75%) ,,Newswire,,ENGLISH,,14-Aug-13,,195  words,CRIME PREVENTION (91%); CORRUPTION (91%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); ETHICS (73%),"The North West MEC for Human Settlements, public Safety and Liaison, Nono Maloyi will launch the Anti-Corruption and Fraud Prevention Strategy aimed at intensifying efforts to prevent and combat fraud and corruption within the department.

The co-operation agreement follows discussions which further revealed that at least 10 mortgaged properties affected by the demolitions of structures in Lenasia are registered on the books of the members of the association. ""The affected loans are currently being investigated by the banks. Most of the loans date back to the 1990s and all, at face value, appear to be normal commercial transactions. We have therefore raised the matter with the department in order to find an amicable solution,"" said the general manager for human settlements at the Banking Association South Africa, Pierre Venter. The parties have agreed to centralise the investigations of the affected loans within the department's Anti-Fraud and Corruption Unit. Gauteng Housing and Local Government Head of Department, Mongezi Mnyani, said the department expected to exclude the properties from the list of houses earmarked for demolitions. In cases where fraud was suspected, the province in collaboration with the Hawks will undertake further investigations. The banks have also committed to conduct their own investigations utilising their internal anti-fraud departments to ensure that their mortgage officials were not complicit in the suspected fraud. The parties have also agreed to form a joint task team in order for the financial institutions to be provided with information of future ""clean ups"" by the department. ""The process is critical as it will allow the financial institution to scrutinise affected properties before any state action is undertaken,"" said Mnyani. He said the banking sector had given the department a commitment to support them in their efforts as it fully supports the need for law and order to prevail and that transgressors should be brought to book. The joint initiative comes after residents of Lenasia claimed that they have mortgage bonds from banks on their properties, in the process misleading the Premier and the MEC to believe that bankers were complicit in the processes of illegally occupying land. However, Venter said after their meeting with the department they discovered the statements had no element of truth in them. More than 80 houses have reportedly been demolished in Lenasia since last week. The department said it had identified 113 houses in the area, which it said were illegally built on land intended for government houses. Government argues that the land was sold to the occupants illegally. The department said this week that investigations by the Anti-Fraud and Corruption Unit revealed that fraudsters sold several stands ranging from R2 500 to R95 000 and issued buyers with fraudulent deeds of sale which bore the department's official logo. This week, Cabinet instructed Human Settlements Minister Tokyo Sexwale to urgently interact with the Gauteng Provincial Government to find a solution to the eviction of people from houses allegedly built illegally in the area."11,South African Official News,11/26/2012,MEC Nono Maloyi commits to fight and combat fraud and corruption,,PAKISTAN (71%) ,,Newswire,,ENGLISH,,14-Aug-13,,348  words,CORRUPTION (91%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (70%),"The North West MEC for Human Settlements, Public Safety and Liaison, Nono Maloyi has committed his department to fight fraud and said will not tolerate corrupt or fraudulent activities, whether internal or external and will vigorously pursue and prosecute any parties, by all legal means available, which engage in such practices or attempt to do so. In a speech, addressed by the Human Settlements Branch, Acting Head of Department, Monnapula Motlogelwa on his behalf, Maloyi raised a concern on how fraud and corruption perturbs service delivery and disadvantages communities at the ground. ""Fraud and Corruption presents a significant potential risk to the Department's assets, service delivery and it compromises the reputation of the Department,"" he said. The MEC said the strategy is established to facilitate the development of internal controls which will assist in the prevention and detection of fraud and corruption, as well as provide guidelines as to how to respond should instances of fraud and corruption be identified.

On this day the world gathers to recommit itself to the fight against corruption, review progress and also share new strategies on how to stop corruption in both private and public sector. The Minister of Public Service and Administration, Lindiwe Sisulu see the 2012 International Anti-Corruption Day as a platform for the South African Government and its people to not only renew their commitment to fight corruption in the public sector and private sector but also to introduce new strategies and tough measures to prevent corruption at all levels of Government. ""The poorest of the poor are victims of corruption everyday as service delivery is compromised, all South Africans must unite against fraud and corruption"" Sisulu said. The Minister is highly concern about cases of corruption, fraud, maladministration and unethical behaviour involving public servants as they collude with private sector companies and individuals to defraud the state and all South Africans. The Minister has instructed that a new strategy ""with very strong teeth"" to fight corruption must be completed by end of the financial year, key to this new strategy is the use of modern technology and intelligent financial systems to prevent corruption and maladministration; effective and speedy finalisation of disciplinary cases and most importantly that officials found guilty of corruption and fraud are dealt with through asserts forfeitures, dismissal from work and blacklisting for future employment opportunities in both private and public sector. The Minister has instructed that the following measures be introduced immediately to enhance existing corruption fighting measures: That a new Anti-Corruption Unit led by a Deputy Director General located in the Department of Public Service and Administration with legislative powers to proactively investigate cases in all three spheres of Government is introduced. Legislation and regulations be developed to give the new unit enough powers to investigate; charge and discipline officials. The unit will employ forensic auditors, specialist investigators and prosecutors to initiate charges. A new National Disciplinary Unit is located in the Department of Public Service and Administration to monitor all disciplinary cases across all levels of Government to ensure that cases are investigated, officials are charged and hearings completed at the shortest time possible. The Unit must have skills and capacity to investigate officials at all levels of Government and to initiate charges against any public servants. The Unit must also keep a database of public servants found guilty and blacklist them to ensure that they are not employed by another Department and private companies. Government must conduct random and regular life style audits and financial status audits for those involved in managing public funds and all officials involved in tender management. That an electronic private interest disclosure system (e-disclosure) is implemented by March 30, 2013 for all public servants in National, Provincial and Local spheres with priorities being all senior managers, middle managers and those involved in tenders and financial management. This will ensure an effective and pro-active management of possible financial conflict of interest between those who manage tenders and private companies. The new system will enable Government to proactively verify business interest of all employees with CIPC formerly CIPRO which registers all private companies, deeds office and e-natis where vehicles are registered. This will also enable Director Generals to easily verify financial interest of officials who adjudicate and evaluate tenders. Government will now know proactively financial interests of all official. The current system is manual and reactive. A national mass media campaign to educate and inform members of the public and private companies of their right to access to service and new platforms to report allegations of fraud and corruption will be launch in January 2013. The Batho Pele Call Centre is also to be re-launched to support the current Anti-Fraud Hotline in ensuring that members of the public also report deliberate delays to render services by officials. Research has shown that at times officials delay payment and service whilst soliciting bribes. The finalisation of service delivery timeframes and standards will also assist to ensure that members of the public know for how long they must wait for service and what steps to take when there is a deliberate delay. The Minister added that members of the public must also play their role in reporting low quality of service from companies appointed by Government and public officials. ""Fighting corruption requires the participation of all South Africans; we must report bad service from officials. We must report low quality of work from contractors and attempts to solicit bribes"" She said. ""A strong and unambiguous message must be sent to public servants that corruption and fraud does not pay and action must be taken against officials involved in corruption, the same must be said to private companies and individuals, they must also know that there are no benefits from corrupt activities."" She said. The Minister committed that the School of Government to be opened in 2013 will also develop a dedicated curriculum to groom ethical and committed public servants whose only interest is serving the poor. ""We seek a public servant who love serving the people, who feel privileged and honoured to be given a responsibility to improve the lives of his/her fellow citizens, not interested in fraud and corruption. The School of Government must produce those cadres who will be our soldiers against maladministration, fraud, corruption and unethical behaviour"" She concluded.

International Anti-Corruption Day is a United Nations Office on Drugs- endorsed initiative, held annually on December 9. According to the agency, the tide on corruption was turning, and there were signs of growing intolerance towards corruption. More politicians and chief executives were being tried and convicted around the world. Modise said the provincial government had resolved to act to uproot corruption. ""We are not playing; we are going after them. We [will] fight corruption without any fear or favour and we will not be bought, dissuaded or succumb to pressure not to pursue those who are plundering resources that are meant to improve the lives of our people,"" she cautioned. She said there were senior people in government who had already felt the heat and some were still in hot water due to corruption in their departments and municipalities. ""There are senior managers in government who have been fired due to corruption and we will continue to suspend and fire those who are being caught in corrupt activities, irrespective of the positions at all levels of government.""

MPACs, just like SCOPAs, will act as a council watchdog over how the public monies are spent at municipal level and also hold the council executive accountable. All KZN municipalities will this weekend attend a meeting in Durban which will be addressed by Speaker of KZN Legislature Peggy Nkonyeni, Provincial SCOPA chairperson Sipho Nkosi and representatives of the department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs. The meeting will also be addressed by representatives of Treasury, the South African Local Government Association (SALGA) and the national Association of Public Accounts Committees (APAC). Amongst issues to be discussed is the state of MPACs in KwaZulu-Natal especially the challenges that the committees face and what kind of intervention they need in order to be more effective in fighting corruption, fraud and maladministration within municipalities. ""Now that the MPACs have been established in all municipalities, the objective is to find out how are they functioning, what kind of support do they have and what kind of training they have had so far and what kind of training they will need in the future. But more importantly we need to find ways on how are they going to organise themselves to learn from each other and exchange information,"" said Nkonyeni. She added that the KZN Legislature has been working very closely with MPACs by inviting the committees to attend SCOPA hearings at the legislature so that they could see how the provincial committee was holding the executive to account. Provincial SCOPA has also had a number of its hearings held at various municipalities.

""The operations focusing on illegal firearms, stolen and robbed vehicles, liquor and drugs which are regarded as main generators of crime have assisted in crime reduction,"" President Zuma said. He was delivering this year's State of the Nation Address in front of a packed joint sitting of Parliament attended by, among others, former Presidents Thabo Mbeki and FW De Klerk. The 2011/2012 crime statistics, released by the police in September last year, show that murder has decreased by 3.1%, attempted murder has decreased by 5.2% and common assault has decreased by 3.4%. Car hijackings have dropped by 11.9%, cash-in-transit heists have decreased by 37.5%, while bank robberies and ATM bombings have decreased by 10.3% and 34.6% respectively. President Zuma emphasised the need to promote safety and reduce crime and corruption in South Africa, mainly through improved policing and an enhanced criminal justice system. ""We urge the private sector to also take this fight against corruption seriously so that we tackle it from all angles."" Highlighting some of the efforts to be taken to ensure that crime does not have a place in society, he revealed that capacity of the Special Investigating Unit , which has been compromised by lack of funds and personnel,  has increased from 70 staff members to more than 600. Zuma made it clear that combating corruption at all levels of government was of paramount importance. ""I have since 2009, signed 34 proclamations directing the SIU to investigate allegations of corruption, fraud or maladministration in various government departments and state entities,"" he told the National Assembly. The impact of the improvements in the investigative and forensic capacity was evident in the improved detection rates for serious crimes. Criminal Investigations were initiated against 203 accused persons in 67 priority cases under investigation by the end September 2012. Pre-trial proceedings have so far been initiated against 191 persons. A total of 66 persons under investigation are alleged to have received R5 million or more benefits through corruption while freezing orders were obtained against 46 persons. Other successes include the arrest and conviction of 107 officials working within the criminal justice system. The Asset Forfeiture Unit seized assets valued at more than R541 million. A total of R61 million of these assets have already been forfeited to the State which will be channelled back to fighting crime and corruption through the criminal asset recovery account. Zuma also revealed that funding of R150 million from the Criminal Assets Recovery Account was approved for the work of the Anti-Corruption Task Team which comprises the Hawks, the Special Investigating Unit and the National Prosecuting Authority. ""These resources are aimed at strengthening the capacity of these law enforcement agencies in our resolve to fight corruption.""

In a statement on Vatican radio's website, Lombardi also referred to the upcoming conclave saying there was 'unacceptable pressure to condition the vote of one or other member of the college of cardinals, who might be disliked for one reason or another'.

The charge against the two men emanated from their actions of corruptly using their positions to rent motor-vehicles for Goabab's private use at the government's cost. The cars were rented during March and April 2007. The charge on which they were convicted was based on an allegation that money from the National Assembly's budget had been used to pay for the rental of cars for Goabab's private use. According to Goabab, the arrangement was that the money paid for the vehicle rentals be recovered from his salary. Acting Judge Tommasi ruled in her verdict that the use of public funds to settle a personal debt of Goabab, even if it was his intention from the start to repay the money, was unlawful and amounted to him having used his position to obtain gratification in the form of a loan for his own benefit. Chief State Prosecutor Danie Small during trial agreed that a fine or, in the case of George, a suspended sentence, would be the most appropriate punishment.

He said there has to be three quotations before any selection is done, and that is when the third quotation for his wife came in. ""We discussed and agreed that the lowest quotation would be selected, so my wife's quotation happened to be the lowest, and she qualified for the job. I did not mislead anyone. The tender board sub-committee usually selects candidates, even when there are only one or two quotations. That was wrong, and I stopped that practice,"" he said in his defence. Responding to the tools and equipment issue, Losper said he does not see anything wrong with the move, explaining that giving tools for private use by council members is a common practice in their council. ""I found them doing it, so it is common practice here as long as the person signs for receiving the tools and returning it. The tools are not for hire, that's why I did not see the need for payment,"" Losper responded."43,"The Namibia Press Agency, (NAMPA)",6/21/2013,Vavi covered up corruption to protect his ally - report,,PAKISTAN (72%) ,,Newswire,,ENGLISH,,14-Aug-13,SOUTH AFRICA,150  words,CORRUPTION (91%); BANKING & FINANCE (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (88%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (88%); FINANCIAL PLANNING (88%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (73%); MONEY LAUNDERING (73%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (66%); LABOR UNIONS (55%),"Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi allegedly covered up a report on apparent corruption involving its investment company to protect his ally, the Mail & Guardian reported today.

Rupert Colville, spokesman for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, said the legislation was 'vague' and 'could easily be used to curtail freedom of expression.' The draft legislation, which could become law within two months, requires journalists to reveal their sources if published information stirs up public sentiment, and would suspend journalists accused of violating the media legislation. The president took power with UN and widespread international backing in September, heading a government that took over from eight years of corruption-riddled transitional rule.

The survey thus revealed that most of the enterprises have an anti-corruption policy framework in place adding that the medium to national enterprises registered a higher percentage of 92 per cent with anti-corruption framework in place. The small enterprises registered 73 per cent. On the issue of risk management, the medium to national enterprises again were in the lead with 77 per cent with such tools in place compared to the small enterprises with 65 per cent. According to the report most of the enterprises merely have guidelines in place especially the small enterprises which is why they are lacking on tools or strategies on accountability, transparency and risk management. The report highly recommended the enterprises develop a comprehensive anti-corruption policy framework supported by a fully operational guideline. This will ensure a total response against corruption and hence minimize if not eliminate corrupt incidence in the sector under review and the country at large,ŒÂ it said. Giving the keynote address during the official launch of the survey report held at Nice Restaurant Director of the ACC Paulus Noa said one of the mandates of the ACC is to examine the practices, systems and procedures of public bodies and private bodies in facilitating the discovery of corrupt practices. The ACC he said is further mandated by law to advise public bodies and private bodies on ways of preventing corrupt practices and on changes of practices, systems and procedures compatible with the effective performance of their duties. ŒÂThe best method to fight corruption is to prevent it. Government through public institutions has to set the standard of zero tolerance for corruption for the private companies to follow,ŒÂ he stated. Applicable rules for public procurement must be known by all participants he pointed out adding that bidding procedures must be above board and transparent enough. He urged that there should be no room for collusion either between officials of public and private companies or through intermediaries and that the use of third party should not be done under the veil of secrecy. ŒÂThough the survey did not reach out all the companies in the country, the outcome clearly shows that private enterprises must review their existing framework to become more compliant with the acceptable standards,ŒÂ he said. Although the survey was commissioned in November 2012, the actual fieldwork only commenced on 04 March 2013 and was completed on 13 April this year. The broad objective of the survey was to establish whether participating organisations have anti-corruption policy frameworks to minimise corruption. This includes strategies and tools which the private sector and SOEs use to improve transparency, accountability and risk management as a way of ensuring good governance. The geographical area covered by the survey is that of paid-up members of the Namibia Chamber of Commerce and Industry (NCCI), including the NCCI branches at Ongwediva, Windhoek, Swakopmund, Walvis Bay and in the //Karas Region. The report indicated that other areas were not covered because it could not obtain the list of members in these areas.

The small enterprises registered 73 per cent. On the issue of risk management, the medium-to-national enterprises were once again in the lead with 77 per cent, while amongst the small enterprises, only 65 per cent had risk management strategies in place. According to the report, most of the enterprises merely have guidelines in place, especially the small enterprises, which is why they lack tools or strategies on accountability, transparency and risk management.

We believe that it is a cancer that deprives our people of the opportunities and the resources needed for development.

""I once again, call on all stakeholders, both in the public and private sectors to play an active role in preventing and combating corruption in Namibia.

Reports carried by local English daily New Era today had it that four of the arrested five persons, excluding Kashiyukile, are all linked to a company which obtained a tender from the Ministry of Health and Social Services a few years back. According to the newspaper report, the five people allegedly conspired to have a total of N.dollars 4,9 million deposited into a bank account supposedly belonging to the company contracted by that Ministry. It is alleged that Kashiyukile was informed that the bank account of the company contracted by her ministry had changed from one for which details were initially provided, and that she must deposit money into a new bank account. She is said to have complied with the instruction, and in order to see if the money had indeed been deposited, an initial amount of N.dollars 500 was allegedly withdrawn from an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It is further alleged that thereafter, the accused persons allegedly proceeded to withdraw an amount of N.dollars two million from inside the bank, raising suspicion amongst bank officials. The bank then informed members of the Namibian Police Force (NamPol) and investigators attached to the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), who arrested the five accused persons last month. All five accused persons each face two counts of corruption under the Anti-Corruption Act, including corruptly using an office or position for gratification. Kashiyukile was arrested on 19 June this year, while Heyn and Abraham were nabbed the following day. Gurirab and Neels were arrested on 24 June 2014. Public Prosecutor Henry Muhongo represented the State, while Windhoek-based defence lawyers Mbushandje Ntinda and Hipura Ujaha represented the accused persons. They will return to the Windhoek Magistrate's Court along Lí_deritz Street on 29 August this year."97,"The Namibia Press Agency, (NAMPA)",9/4/2014,Two senior Unam employees arrested in connection with corruption in tendering process,,NAMIBIA (93%),,Newswire,,ENGLISH,,5-Sep-14,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (88%) WINDHOEK",192  words,CORRUPTION (91%); ARRESTS (91%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); LITIGATION (78%); MAGISTRATES (74%); BAIL (73%),"Two senior Unam employees were arrested this week in connection with alleged corruption in the tendering process for the construction of hostel facilities at the Neudam Agricultural Campus.

The four accused persons' alleged fraud and corruption trial will kick-off in the Windhoek High Court here on 01 October next year (20150), and will run until 16 October 2015. The suspects are former chief executive officer (CEO) of the Roads Contractor Company (RCC) Kelly Nghixulifwa, 56; David Imbili, 46; Hafeni Nghinamwaami, 48; and 51-year-old Anna Ndoroma. The date for the start of the trial was made known when the group made another appearance before High Court Judge-President Petrus Damaseb during a pre-trial of case management here on Thursday morning. Meanwhile, the four accused persons will return to the Windhoek High Court on 23 October 2014 for the date of the trial to be finally confirmed or changed. The four were arrested between 14 and 16 February 2014 by investigators attached to the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC). They face a total of eight main charges, including corruption, fraud, theft and money-laundering. Four of the eight charges flow from the Roads Contractor Company's involvement in the B1 City property development project during 2005 and 2006. Other charges relate to Nghixulifwa's tenure as chief executive officer of the RCC, which came to an end with his resignation at the end of 2006 after he had been suspended from his position. The Prosecutor-General's office had decided to indict Ndoroma, Nghixulifwa, Imbili, Nghinamwaami, the Ae Gams Engineering company, represented by Imbili, and Cradle Investments, represented by Nghinamwaami, in the High Court on the main charges of corruptly using an office or position for gratification, fraud, failing to disclose an interest in a contract and money-laundering. It is alleged that Nghixulifwa was a shareholder in both Ae Gams Engineering and Cradle Investments, but allegedly concealed his stake in the two companies by having his shares held in Ndoroma's name. It is further alleged that Nghixulifwa failed to disclose his interests in the two companies to the board of directors of the RCC. With the RCC Board allegedly kept in the dark about Nghixulifwa's stake in Ae Gams Engineering, in which Nghinamwaami and Imbili were also shareholders, Nghixulifwa and Imbili in February 2005 signed an agreement in terms of which the RCC and Ae Gams Engineering were to undertake the B1 City shopping complex and taxi rank development as a joint venture. Nghixulifwa thus allegedly corruptly used his position at the RCC to buy the plot of land where the B1 City development was to take place on behalf of Ae Gams Engineering with RCC funds and a credit facility in the amount of N.dollars 4,87 million. Nghixulifwa allegedly also defrauded the RCC by bringing managers at the parastatal and the chairperson of the RCC board under the impression that a mortgage bond of N.dollars 4,87 million had been registered over the B1 City property in the RCC's favour, when in fact that had not been done. It is also alleged in the indictment that while still employed as RCC chief executive officer, Nghixulifwa defrauded the RCC and a construction company, Murray and Roberts, in December 2004 by concealing his shareholding in Cradle Investments, and inducing the RCC and Murray and Roberts to pay a 'facilitation fee' of N.dollars 150 000 to Cradle Investments and Nghinamwaami for the role they had supposedly played in the construction of a new head office for the parastatal. It is alleged that in fact Nghinamwaami and Cradle Investments had not been appointed as project facilitators, and were not entitled to receive such a fee. It is also alleged that Nghixulifwa used his position with the parastatal in April 2006 to have a debt of N.dollars 29 954 of Cradle Investments with a firm of auditors settled with RCC funds. In another charge, it is alleged that Nghixulifwa corruptly used his position as RCC CEO in March 2006 to have a payment of N.dollars 92 729 made with RCC funds on the home loan account of an RCC employee, Brian Nalisa, which was allegedly in arrears. Windhoek-based defence lawyers Mbushandje Nhinda, Sisa Namandje and Frank Kopplinger are representing the accused persons.

The party has also over the years worked with the homeless and the landless in southern Namibia, as well as in the northern parts of the country and the Zambezi Region, according to Beukes. Amongst others, WRP in its election manifesto promised to advance the demands of former members of the South West African Territorial Force (SWATF) or Koevoet and their families in relation to pensions, loss of income and losses in general through economic sanctions, marginalisation, victimisation and discrimination, landlessness and homelessness. It also said it will articulate and support the demands of the OvaHerero and Nama people for reparations for the 19041908 genocide from the government of Germany. ""We will further advance the demand for basic needs of the working class families to be provided and subsidised by Government on the first tier level (municipalities), housing, water and electricity, public transport, clinics, kindergartens, as well as sports and recreation facilities to be brought to the people. We will advance taxation for excesses and demand living wages tied to the rate of inflation (and not minimum wages),"" it added."104,"The Namibia Press Agency, (NAMPA)",12/9/2014,It's difficult to remove corruption: Forensic expert,,AFRICA (95%); NAMIBIA (94%); SOUTH AFRICA (92%),,Newswire,,ENGLISH,,10-Dec-14,"WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA (92%) WINDHOEK",592  words,CORRUPTION (94%); FORENSICS (90%); MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS (89%); PUBLIC POLICY (89%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (78%),"The AntiCorruption Commission of Namibia (ACC) together with the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) and the Hanns Seidel Foundation (HSF) commemorated the international anticorruption day here on Tuesday.

The two accused businessmen made another appearance in the Windhoek Magistrate's Court before Magistrate Jarmaine Muchali along Luderitz Street on Wednesday morning, and they were informed that their trial will resume on 02 July this year (2015). The trial, which is based on charges of alleged corruption, was on Wednesday postponed to 02 July this year because the parties (prosecution and accused) involved in the matter are still awaiting for the High Court to hand down a judgment for the recusal of the magistrate from presiding over the case. A ruling on the two accused persons' apllication for the recusal of Windhoek Magistrate Helvi Kauna Shilemba from the trial is still pending with the High Court. The matter was postponed today to 02 July this year, as per the agreement reached by Public Prosecutor Erastus Hatutale and the accused persons' defence lawyers, Advocate Richard Metcalfe and Louis Du Pisani. On 24 February this year, the two accused men suffered a heavy blow when the Windhoek Magistrate's Court dismissed their application for discharge. ""After carefully going through the evidence presented by both defence lawyers, Richard Metcalfe and Louis Du Pisani, and the prosecution team led by Public Prosecutor Arrie Husselmann, I have come to the conclusion that the two accused persons have a case to answer before court,"" said Magistrate Shilemba at the time. As a result of this, the two accused are now to be put on their defence when the trial continues on 26 February next year. The two defence lawyers also brought an urgent application for the discharge of their clients in February this year, shortly after Public Prosecutor Arrie Husselmann, who appeared for the prosecution during the hearing of the discharge application, closed the State's case. This unsuccessful discharge application was brought before court in terms of Section 174 of the Criminal Procedures' Act, the two defence lawyers stated at the time. They wanted the court to discharge their clients on the grounds that thus far, there had been no prima-facie evidence presented before court to indicate that the two men were involved in the alleged corruption, as the State claims. Husselmann, however, asked the court to dismiss the discharge application, arguing that the two accused persons should be put on their defences and should testify before court. On 06 February this year, the 36-year-old Aupindi and his co-accused Di Savino, whose age was not given, entered not guilty pleas at the start of their corruption trial. In the matter, it is alleged that Di Savino paid for a N.dollars 50 000 swimming pool which was installed at Aupindi's home in return for tenders for the refurbishment of the parastatal's resorts. The two men each pleaded not guilty to a number of charges under the Anti-Corruption Act of 2003, namely a main count of allegedly corruptly providing false information to an authorised officer, and a count of attempting to defeat or obstruct the course of justice. They also pleaded not guilty to the alternative count on the main charge. The duo entered their pleas as per Section 119 of Namibia's Criminal Procedures Act, and as per the instructions from their respective defence lawyers. Evidence contained in a summary of substantial facts in the charge-sheet has it that the former NWR boss had provided false information to an investigating officer of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), William Lloyd, by stating that he had paid N.dollars 50 000 in cash to a local company LIC Pools for a swimming pool installed at his house in 25 Kestrel Street, Hochland Park. The allegation against Aupindi is that he did not pay for the swimming pool himself, and that Di Savino in fact paid for the pool as a kickback in exchange for tile tenders awarded to his co-accused for work done at NWR resorts. Di Savino, like Aupindi, faces charges of providing false information to an ACC investigator, and attempting to defeat or obstruct the course of justice. The former NWR chief left the parastatal at the end of December 2010, four months before his contract was due to expire. Media reports at the time claimed that he received a 'golden handshake' of about N.dollars 4,5 million. Aupindi and Di Savino are free on bail, and their bail was also extended until 26 February 2013 for the continuation of the trial.

Meanwhile, prosecution representative, Deputy Prosecutor-General Ed Marondedze was not happy with the postponement of the case, as he was ready to proceed with the trial. The trial is set to run until 15 May 2015. The two accused persons are free on a warning and they were again today warned to appear before court on Monday next week. Conradie and Damases were arrested by investigators attached to the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) on charges of corruption in connection with a N.dollars 60 million-advertisement contract for Mobile Telecommunications Limited (MTC), on whose board Conradie served as chairperson at the time. Damases is accused of allegedly conspiring with Conradie to commit an offence. ACC deputy director Erna van der Merwe earlier said Conradie allegedly corruptly solicited gratification as an inducement or reward for giving assistance or using his influence in the promotion or procurement of a contract with MTC for the provision of advertising services. Conradie had represented several people in high-profile court cases in Namibia. He also serves on various influential national positions and boards, including the Lands Tribunal."113,"The Namibia Press Agency, (NAMPA)",5/7/2015,Windhoek resident arrested on corruption charges acquires legal representation,,NAMIBIA (94%),,Newswire,,ENGLISH,,12-May-15,WINDHOEK,205  words,CORRUPTION (93%); LAWYERS (91%); ARRESTS (91%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS (78%); JURISDICTION (75%); JUDGES (72%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (69%),"Windhoek resident Sarah Damases, who was arrested in June 2012 on corruption charges, has acquired legal representation.

Hard work and growth galvanise wealth and its enjoyment, usage and distribution. However, it is in the management of wealth and who has it, when, and how, that the problem of corruption arises to throw spanner in the works for even the best planned economy, again, in any part of the world. Today we look at the way and manner corruption has bedevilled the political, and economic management of some nations in recent times and, how it has in turn, taxed the leadership styles of such leaders in such a way as to threaten the political stability and security of their nations. These nations are Turkey, Brazil and Nigeria which are rich or well off in terms of economic bounties, endowment and natural resources and Central African Republic - CAR- a poor nation whose mismanagement by its leaders has turned it into a failed state, whose leader on Thursday was asked in a meeting in another nation, namely Chad, to resign for sanity to return to the CAR. In the last few days and weeks, the leaders of these nations have been in the news with the cross of corruption dangling around their necks like a modern, proverbial sword of Damocles. In Turkey a rattled but powerful PM Reccep Tayyip Erdogan sacked 350 police bosses in many Turkish cities for the way and manner they have brought corruption charges against and arrested sons of his ministers leading to the resignation of three of such minsters - with one of them saying on his way out of office, that the PM too should resign. In Brazil, President Dilmar Rousseff had to assure FIFA President Sepp Blatter that Brazil's stadia will be ready for the World Cup this year, whereas protests and city riots in 2013 over corruption and inequalities in the Brazilian nation had stalled construction of stadia and sports facilities needed for the World Cup in Brazil this year. Nigeria presents a different scenario amongst the nations being considered here. The Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan is unrattled or unfazed by corruption charges especially those concerning the Aviation Minister who was also reported to have changed her credentials several times over on the internet this week, in response to accusations that she did not attend a school in the US which said it never offered the Accounting degree in her credentials. Indeed the Nigerian President said he is a good example of how anyone can reach the top in Nigeria as all that is needed is education. He also emphasised that those calling themselves' progressives' in Nigeria qualify for the tag because they are criticising him and he is not bothered by that as the economy is on course. CAR too provides a different kettle of fish in terms of political mismanagement and injustice leading to anarchy arising from religious violence. The Interim President who was forced to resign at a conference of neighboring states in Chad was the first Muslim president in a nation where 50% of the population are Christians and only 15 % are Muslims. Already over one million people have been displaced in that nation with many Nigerians sent packing home by the crisis. These then are just the tip of the ice bag of the quagmire these nations and their leaders face in their battles with the stigma or reality of the cancer of corruption in their polity. It is necessary to now dilate on how they have reached the sorry pass that is now rocking their various political and economic systems. In Turkey's case the PM - Reccep Tayyip Erdogan - is confident that the police are using corruption charges to smear the integrity of his government and has ignored calls for his own resignation. He surely has cause to be that confident because his party the Justice and Development Party- AKP - has won three elections back to back and he is preparing to be nominated for the more senior position of President of Turkey having exhausted his constitutional term as PM. He however should not be too confident on that score as he has stepped on a few powerful toes in the way he has used his sweeping mandates at the polls . Indeed what has emboldened Erdogan is that he has emasculated the army which is the guarantor of Turkey's secularity under its constitution handed down by founder Kemak Ataturk in 1923. Under Erdogan's three terms many generals in the Turkish army have been tried and jailed for plotting coups. Erdogan had the support of a religious leader now in exile in the US as well as that of the police in rounding up military officers and trying them for treason and jailing such officers. Now the religious leader and the police are at loggerheads with Erdogan and it can not be business as usual in Turkey's volatile politics. This is because the army is lurking and licking its wounds at the hands of Erdogan but bidding its time to strike with the sword of secularity. Will these corruption charges or saga be the death knell of the hitherto success story of the Erdogan- AKP era that had an Islamist party that used the power of elections to successfully handcuff Turkey's military into a toothless bull dog, afraid to re-enact its time honoured duty of using coups to protect Turkey's secularity? Surely time will tell, and very soon too, if you ask me. In Brazil, FIFA's Sepp Blatter said he cried foul over Brazil's state of preparations for the 2014 World Cup because he said Brazil had more time than any previous host to prepare for the tournament. In addition Brazil is to host the 2016 Olympics and it is both competitions that have brought out the anger in Brazilian youths about corruption and quality of life in Brazil. At the last Confederation Cup in Brazil last year, which was expected to be a test-run for this year's World Cup, there were protests at the venues and stadia in Brazil. On being interviewed, Brazilian protesters complained of the high costs of the construction sites and the level of corruption in Sports administration in Brazil. A well known Brazilian soccer star called one of the bosses of the Brazilian soccer administration a thief. The protesters also accused the government of presiding over high transport costs and long hours for poor Brazilians in commuting to and from work while executing fantastically expensive stadia projects in the midst of dismal poverty. Luckily Brazilians have a president they can vouch for in terms of integrity and honesty and she has pushed through the Parliament reforms and palliative measures to fund infrastructure, transportation and education from and beyond. President Dilmar Yousseff has also assured FIFA that soccer is the main sports of Brazilians and that the Brazilian Stadia will be ready for the 2014 World Cup. Although I am not a Brazilian I urge Brazilians to believe their president and give her time to clean up the mess in their soccer stable as soccer is one of the high revenue earners for the Brazilian economy all over Europe as at this point in time. Nigeria's fight against corruption has been an endemic and half hearted one. Right now many Nigerians feel that the fact that the president has not sacked his Aviation Minister is sufficient proof that the fight against corruption has derailed totally. In effect then the Nigerian President reminds one of Frederick the Great of Russia who once told a visitor to his palace - My people and I have reached an understanding which satisfies us both. They are to say what they like and I am to do as I wish. That seems to be the attitude of the Jonathan Administration on corruption and that is a great pity indeed given its reverberating effect on the political stability and security of a great nation like Nigeria."115,The Nation (Nigeria),1/28/2014,"Dear President Jonathan, Corruption is bane of Nigeria",,AFRICA (94%); NIGERIA (94%); SWITZERLAND (90%),,Newspaper, Theophilus Ilevbare,ENGLISH,"GRAUBUNDEN, SWITZERLAND (57%)",20-May-14,,1315  words,CORRUPTION (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (89%); SCANDALS (78%); POLITICAL DEBATES (70%),"""Corruption is not the cause of all the problems confronting Africa. In terms of security, Boko Haram is the biggest challenge we (Nigeria) have at the moment."" - President Goodluck Jonathan ""For Mr. President to have said that corruption is not our number one problem that must be the misstatement of the century."" - Itse Sagay (SAN) The first quote was the remark of President Goodluck Jonathan at the just concluded World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, while making his contribution to a televised debate titled, ""Africa's Next Billion."" The president has completely erased any iota of doubt that he has a thorough grasp of critical issues like the prevalent endemic corruption now crippling governance that demands his urgent attention as president of Nigeria and frontline leader on the continent. One would expect that thorough research should be done by his fawning aides before he speaks at such a forum. A statement like that is the least expected from the president of one of the most corrupt countries in the world. President Jonathan would have been dead right if he had said every problem confronting Nigeria and indeed Africa is the result of corruption. Any argument in the contrary is like saying there are evils not traceable to the devil. Mr. President has displayed too much incompetence in handling corruption in Nigeria and several of his other responsibilities as president and remarks like the one in Davos, buttresses this point. It is most unfortunate that our president has a kindergarten understanding of graft and its concomitant effects.He seizes every speaking opportunity to make excuses why he cannot fight corruption. Such prevarication will not help the anti-graft war, they only serve the purpose of encouraging more corruption. His comments are coming at a time that allegations of corruption against officials of his administration are mounting. The Stella Oduah BMW scandal is still fresh in our memory. With his latest misstatement making national headlines, he reminds us of the fifth presidential media chat of September 29, 2013, were he said that Nigeria's corruption was merely a perception which is grossly exaggerated. As a member of the intellectual community, he ought to know better and not mistake effects for causes. Corruption diverts capital from legitimate purposes to making wrong-headed policy decisions which deprives the country of a pool of finances. He has developed a penchant for singing a different tune from realities on ground, same way he has insisted that electricity has improved in spite of citizen reports to the contrary.Deflecting international attention from sleaze is the least expected at a time the country needed a consistent and dogged fight against this monster. The level of corruption in the country demands serious political will to combat, not occasional rhetorical statements like the promise to fight the scourge in his New Year message. The present administration has embarrassingly failed to realise that the root cause of the present wave of terrorism ravaging the north east is the result of decades of corruption and impunity of perpetrators coupled with the failure of successive government to provide quality, affordable education to Nigerian children. Graft goes beyond misappropriation of public funds. How Boko Haram insurgency that affects a few local governments can be rated above a hydra-headed monster that has eaten deep into the entire Nigerian fabric cutting across all sectors of the economy and all levels of government, stifling development, can only be understood by the president. The Islamic insurgency that the president cited as a major challenge to his government has its foundation in corruption. Government of isolation or exclusion which breeds injustice and disaffection is corruption. The country might be having a tough time combating the insurgency of Boko Haram, it does not in any way imply insecurity has overtaken graft. Government malfeasance is the result of dilapidated infrastructure such as roads, health care, collapsed educational system and poor electricity. Worse still, the failure of our security operatives to effectively deal with the Boko Haram insurgency is also attributable to graft. Billions are voted every year for purchase of combat weapons, training and re-training of security personnel but they somehow end up in private pockets. For example, a former Inspector General of Police is still standing trial for diverting police funds. Whenever the president makes such statements, it shows he is disconnected from the over one hundred million Nigerians who live in abject poverty, same class of people he belonged before he veered into politics. He lives in self-denial of the realities on ground. Terrorism is no doubt a major problem, even globally, but fighting the root causes and other issues that promote the culture of violence requires a holistic approach. Some of the probes that shows an evident lack of political will to decisively deal with the menace of corruption include: The KPMG report that indicted the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) for corrupt practices; The Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) audit report exposing 10 years of corruption in the upstream and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry; the probe of the Pension Fund Management by the Senate Joint Committee on Public Service and Establishment, State and Local Government Administration; the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe that exposed alarming revelations of corruption in the capital market; the probe of the oil subsidy regime by the Ad hoc-committee of the House of Reps; the non-prosecution of those indicted in the Halliburton LNG bribery scandal, the recent Stella Oduah BMW scandal and the unsatisfactory explanation the NNPC has given for the $10.8billion of crude oil earning the Cental Bank of Nigeria (CBN) declared missing. The list is almost in exhaustive. It is safe to say every problem we have in Nigeria today has its roots in corruption. We would be living in a fool's paradise if we expected a president that has been encouraging official corruption to see anything bad in it much less a problem for Nigeria. This will amount to shooting himself in the foot. Rather than roll up his sleeves and concentrate on fixing Nigeria by fighting corruption frontally, he has instead, resorted to wishing the problem away by selling a warped ideology and diverting attention to insecurity. If this is the thinking of the presidency, and the line of reasoning that this administration wants to toe, then am sorry, we are doomed! I wish them Good luck. Jonathan should as a matter of urgency, combat the prevalent endemic corruption now crippling governance (at all levels) and stunting the economy of the country. Judicial officers blame the absurd rulings on corruption cases on the outdated provisions of our antediluvian law - like plea bargains, which allow wealthy Nigerians to get laughable sentences for gargantuan corruption - needs amendment; else criminality and corruption will continue to flourish. It is why corruption has become a raging monster in this administration. Regrettably, there are no serious efforts to review these laws. Justice delayed is another variant of graft. Add that to looting, political desperation, nepotism, impunity, electoral fraud, perjury and you get a snippet of what corruption is. There is no better time to step up the fight and stem the tide of sleaze than now. Year 2014, to Nigerians, is not just another year, but the end of a century of national existence and the beginning of another. When the centenary celebration proper begins, it should be time for sober reflection on how far we have come. One of the numerous national questions that will continue to reverberate in our minds will be: how did we find ourselves in this abyss of monumental corruption?"116,The Nation (Nigeria),2/11/2014,CP warns officers against corruption,,NIGERIA (92%),,Newspaper,Kolade Adeyemi,ENGLISH,,20-May-14,,112  words,CORRUPTION (91%); COUNTERTERRORISM (85%); TERRORISM (51%),"Kano State Commissioner of Police Adenrele Tasheed Shinaba, who resumed in the state yesterday, warned officers and men to shun corruption, harassment and torture.

The President spoke yesterday in Abuja at the swearing-in of the chairman and members of the National Population Commission (NPC), a member of ICPC and two new special advisers. The ceremony took place before the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting. Those sworn in were Eze Iheoma (NPC chairman); Bala Qbayen and Aliyu Kwali (NPC members); Bako Abdullahi (ICPC member) and Senator Suleiman Ajadi and Fidelia Njeze (special advisers for National Assembly and New Partnership for Africa's Development NEPAD). The President faulted remarks claiming that his body language showed that he was not fighting corruption. He insisted that the anti-graft agencies had made huge gains in the fight against corruption, which many Nigerians were unaware of. The President cited the conviction of about 250 people for various acts of malfeasance under his administration. Jonathan said: ""ICPC and EFCC must make Nigerians believe that they are working. I know what you are doing, but not everybody knows what you are doing. Ordinarily, these are agencies whose activities are not supposed to be made too loud because you don't celebrate a situation where you send 100 or 200 Nigerians to prison. ""But the society is so funny. These days, anybody who wants to claim any element of credibility will go to the television and attack the government for corruption. 'The President's body language shows that he is not fighting corruption or he is not ready to fight corruption.' Sometimes, it's even the corrupt people who are making these statements... If you want to be an angel, just attack the government; whatever you have done is covered. ""Recently, the EFCC published the list of about 250 people it convicted. That is a huge number. Yet, some people say the government is not fighting corruption. How many countries have convicted half that number of people within a space of time? Dr Jonathan urged Iheoma to give Nigerians the accurate population figures to enable the three tiers of government to plan properly. He said: ""...Only yesterday (Tuesday), when we had our Economic Management Team meeting, the coordinating minister for the Economy and the Finance minister said people talk about the growth of the economy at six to seven per cent but it is not impacting on the people. ""People say if the economy is growing, it should impact on the people, such as employment, feeding and other things. She said well, if the economy is growing at a particular rate and our population is growing much more than the growth of the economy, then we have challenges. When we relate the two, the economic rate and population rate then you run at a negative, and probably these are the issues."" ""So, when we have a country that the population is growing than the way our economy is growing, then we must know our population figures, so that government at federal, state and local levels will be able to plan,"" he said. On why he removed the former Chairman of NPC, Festus Odimegwu, Jonathan said: ""So population commission is critical and you also have to be mindful about the statements you make and that is not limited to the National Population Commission but to all of us holding offices. You must be mindful and not make statements that will create problem for the society. I dropped your predecessor because of certain statements he made and brought credibility problem to the commission."" ""Perception in most cases are stronger than reality; no matter what you do, if the perception is wrong then society will not follow you. So I believe that you will bring strong leadership to the National Population Commission as the Senior Advocate of Nigeria, I believe you are at the highest level of practice, you are at the top and you will do a good job there,"" the President added. ""And for the special adviser on National Assembly, you are coming at an interesting time when people are crossing to the left and right. Luckily, you have been a part of the National Assembly; you have been a senator, you know the games you play there; you know the trick. You will be able to relate with every member. The Federal Government is for everybody and that is why we cannot talk the way they talk. Because as long as you won election to be the president of a country you are the president of everybody, even those who abuse you, even those that are ready to kill you, so you have to protect them. ""To the SA on the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD) and African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), the key area you are going to handle are relatively new in our political history. It was formed by some African heads of state; of course, President Obasanjo was one of the pioneers who came up with the concept of NEPAD and APRM. I believe as African states, we have not been able to reach the level of their vision or dream of what made them form NEPAD and APRM. So, you have a lot of work to do, to work with your colleagues in other countries to see that Nigeria gets to where these great men and women envisioned for us to be. Congratulating them, he said their appointment is coming at a critical time when many things are happening at the same time. Speaking for the others, Iheoma promised that they would leave up to the expectations of Nigerians. ""We are eternally grateful to you for giving us the opportunity to serve this country,"" he added."118,The Nation (Nigeria),2/19/2014,Invest in anti-corruption campaign',,NIGERIA (99%); ISRAEL (94%),,Newspaper, Yusuf Alli,ENGLISH,,20-May-14,"ABUJA, NIGERIA (88%)",364  words,CORRUPTION (95%); ALUMNI (85%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); TALKS & MEETINGS (73%); UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION (66%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (62%); ALUMNI ASSOCIATIONS (62%),"The Chairman of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), Mr. Nta Ekpo, yesterday urged Nigerians to invest in anti-corruption campaign.

The ICPC chief said every Nigerian has been negatively affected by corruption one way or the other. He said: ""God has blessed Nigeria with a good and lovely environment.

He urged the President to govern by the rule of law and not the rule of man. Amaechi spoke yesterday at the Government House, Port Harcourt, while receiving the British Minister for Africa and Member of Parliament Mark Simmonds. The NGF chairman said: ""The last letter written by the (suspended) Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mallam Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, was the diversion of $49.8 billion. Now, they have been able to manage the crisis to reach $20 billion, but $49.8 billion was spent outside the Appropriation Law. So, it is all about diversion. ""While I join you to say we should fight oil theft, when the British Prime Minister meets the Nigerian President, he should also deal with the issue of financial diversion. The way the President spoke in his media chat yesterday (on Monday), there seems to be uncertainty. ""He (President Jonathan) does not know the figures accurately. They are calling $20 billion, while others say it is $10 billion, but even if it is $1 billion, it is N170 billion, which is almost the budget for Enugu, Anambra and Kwara States combined in a year. So, when the Prime Minister is discussing with Mr. President (Jonathan), they should address these issues. ""This is the highest level of corruption in the history of Nigeria. So, it is important that when you see President Jonathan, he should deal with these issues, so that we can develop and govern the state. ""Yesterday (Monday), Governors' Forum met and it appears we do not have money to pay salaries anymore. This is not caused by oil theft alone, but with financial diversion, which does not go through the Appropriation Law. It is pure impunity, illegal and a breach of the Constitution and that is against the rule of law. ""So, it is important that when you talk with the Presidency, advise them to govern by the rule of law and not by the rule of man. You should also tell your friends and partners in Europe that since the President in Nigeria is not mindful of obeying the Constitution, those of you who are closer to him can advise him that countries all over the world are governed by rules for which everybody knows the punishment attached to offenders."" The Rivers governors added that the Federal Government must be more serious with the fight against oil theft. Amaechi said: ""I do not know how much you have seen about oil theft and I do not know if the Federal Government is serious about combating oil theft. Why I say this is that for two years now, the Federal Government has refused entry into the country, two surveillance helicopters paid for by the Rivers State Government. ""These helicopters have cameras and their job is to fly all over and whomever that is stealing oil, you will see. The helicopter will have a monitor with the Army, Police, Airforce and with the Department of State Security (DSS). ""I suspect the refusal may be for political reasons. The helicopters have been packed in America for two years now and the Rivers State Government is paying demurrage on them. If you see how much oil we are losing, we hear it is about $7 billion annually, then you will see that we need the helicopters. ""We paid for them, not the Federal Government and we are prepared to help them, but the President (Goodluck Jonathan) has emphatically refused to allow the two helicopters into the country for the past two years. We are still paying demurrage. The manufacturers have told us if they should sell them. ""So, if the Federal Government says it needs help, why not bring in the helicopters, rather than run to the British Government? These are questions you should ask them. I said the same thing to the American delegation. Our problem is not just oil theft which is costing this country to lose about $7 billion a year, but financial diversion."" Simmonds said he was in the country to see the United Kingdom's investments, especially in the oil and gas sector, and to also participate in Nigeria's centenary celebration. He condemned the environmental degradation caused by oil theft and indicated the readiness of the United Kingdom to partner with Nigeria to to tackle the menace. Simmonds said: ""I just came from the Niger Delta area, where I saw some of the sites affected by environmental degradation, even some of the environment damaged and it makes us to emphasise the importance of Nigeria's authority to tackle the problem."" The British minister said Prime Minister David Cameron and Jonathan were discussing how the two countries could work together to make a positive difference."120,The Nation (Nigeria),3/15/2014,"Amaechi, Fashola, Ribadu, others tackle F G on corruption, insecurity",,NIGERIA (97%),,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,31-May-14,"LAGOS, NIGERIA (90%)",1242  words,CORRUPTION (90%); REBELLIONS & INSURGENCIES (90%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (77%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (77%); GOVERNORS (76%); TERRORISM (73%); NATIONAL SECURITY (71%),"overnors Rotimi Amaechi (Rivers), Babatunde Fashola (Lagos), Adams Oshiomhole (Edo), Tanko Al-Makura (Nasarawa) and Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti), as well as former Chairman, Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC), Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, yesterday in Lagos declared that the Federal Government is off the course in the fight against corruption in the country. They spoke yesterday at the Third Retreat of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) held at Eko Hotel and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos.

If we have less private jets,we see you live in moderation, we will follow and copy you, "" the former anti-graft boss said. He said that corruption was a major threat to development, saying Nigeria would be far better fighting it. Ribadu advised state governments to put in place mechanisms to check corruption in their respective states. He described corruption as a deep-rooted malaise which could not be fought by centrally-controlled agencies alone. He said that the active involvement of the states in the fight against corruption would check leakages and promote development. ""The states can do more and achieve more in the fight against corruption because they control a substantial amount of development resources. ""If they leave the fight to centrally controlled agencies alone, we will not get the desired results."" On the Maiduguri attack, he said: ""As I am talking to you now, part of Maiduguri is under attack and people are being killed. This is a sad note for our country. I believe security is not what you can restrict to internal mechanism alone. We have reached the level where the country should seek international assistance to end the killings in the country."" overnor Fayemi said there would always be a problem ""when the gap between abject poverty and inexplicable wealth is so wide as you have it now in the country."" He added: ""Any society that has problem with economy always ends up with insecurity. It is unfortunate that after many people were killed recently, the Federal Government still went ahead to host the centenary celebration."" Speaking on Building System and Institutions that Prevent Corruption, Governor Fashola said corruption in the country has reached a level where everybody must rise to nip it in the bud. His words: ""People's social status is incompatible with their income. They host social parties every weekend, feeding about 150 people and spraying money without recourse to the negative effect. ""If you can step on your own sweat, something is fundamentally wrong. There is a leakage somewhere that bankrolls the reckless spending. We reward people for no honour achieved. The police are corrupt because their pension had been looted."" overnor Oshiomhole urged Nigerians to rise and fight corruption, noting that the dysfunctional effect of corruption is visible in all departments of the country's national life. ""If we all judiciously make use of the resources at our disposal, there will be less cases of corruption and those factors that induce corruption will be minimal, "" he said. Also speaking, former Independent Corrupt Practices and Related Offenses Commission and Justice of the Court of Appeal, Justice Mustapha Akanbi, stressed the need for the political will to fight corruption. Building system and institutions that prevent corruption, he pointed out, should be given adequate attention. He said: ""When Nuhu Ribadu, former EFCC chairman and I were fighting corruption, we knew it was possible to take anybody to court. But the story is different today. When the former Aviation Minister, Mrs Stella Oduah was accused of corrupt practices, it took government a long time to remove her from office. But in the case of Mallam Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, the President did not waste time to suspend him."" He maintained that any person who must be a leader or president must be transparent in the discharge of his duties to the people. Prof. Akin Oyebode of the University of Lagos (UNILAG) said: ""It is an unwarranted assault on the nation's integrity which needs to be fought to the hilt if Nigeria is to survive. While it continues to threaten our national survival, no effort should be spared to bring it to the heel. ""Nigeria has enough laws and institutions to combat corruption. The architecture of the war against corruption seems adequate even if there might be the need for re-tooling here and there. ""A situation where anti-corruption agencies are denied the wherewithal to sustain the anti-corruption crusade smacks of a calculated attempt to disembowel and incapacitate them."" Also present at the retreat were Senator Bukola Saraki Governor Aliyu Wamako (Sokoto) Deputy Governor of Imo State, Eze Madumere Dep. Governor of Osun State Grace Laoye-Tomori Governor Adams Oshiomhole (Edo) Governor Tanko Almakura (Nasarawa) Deputy Governor of Oyo State, Moses Adeyemo Dep. Governor of Ogun State, Segun Adesegun Prof. Grace Alele Williams Governor Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti) Deputy Govenor of Kwara State, Elder Peter Kishira and Governor Abdullazeez Yari (Zamfara). In a communique at the end of the retreat, the Governors' Forum said that the anti-corruption battle should be ""anchored on a massive programme of national value-reorientation involving the state sector, private sector and civil society."" According to them, the ""debilitating impact of corruption on national development and the adverse human development indices requires a concerted effort to combat corruption in both private and public sectors of the Nigerian economy."" They added that the fight against corruption ""needs strong political will, moral leadership, certainty of sanction and commitment of governors to succeed and pledged to fill the role."" On security, the governors reiterated their commitment to ""pursue cooperation on security management, including sharing of information and placing emphasis on human security needs of our people."" They called for the reintroduction of teacher training colleges across the country as part of the effort to enhance educational quality and access. The forum adopted its Strategic Plan for 2014-2016.

He also said the government would no longer treat the Boko Haram insurgency with kid gloves. The President spoke at two events a in the southern African country -when he met with host President Hifikepunye Pohamba at the Conference Hall of the Namibia State House and during a meeting with the Nigerian community at the Country Club, Windhoek. He told the Nigerians that ""corruption is everywhere but it is over-celebrated in the country to the extent that the nation and its people are stigmatised."" The president stressed that while his administration would not condone the menace, using big stick would not be a solution to end corruption. He said in fighting corruption, government had continued to strengthen the relevant institutions. The president said that with the promulgation ofŒædecrees and laws stipulating capital punishment for armed robbery, the menace had not stopped. The president called on every Nigerians to resolve to do the right thing and support the government in its efforts at building a new Nigeria. He assured that if all handsŒæwere on deck and the citizens cooperated with the government, the nation would be completely transformed in the nextŒæ10 years. ""The green passport should be a symbol of honour, respect and dignity, not humiliation,"" he said. He described Nigeria as a great country, adding that with certain definite steps the administration was taking, it would take its rightful position in the globe. Jonathan assured the gathering that with all the political tension being created by the opposition in the country, he would not play politics with the development of the nation. He said the government had taken pragmatic steps to end the challenges of oil theft and piracy before 2015. According to him, the Federal Government has decided to put more force into curtailing the activities of the Boko Haram group that is unleashing terror in the Northeast region. He solicited the support of his Namibian counterpart and world leaders in stamping out terrorism globally. He said: ""The issue of global terror is worrisome and in Nigeria, we believe that a terror attack on anywhere in the world is a terror attack on everyone. It may be more in one country compared to the other, for instance, in the Northeastern parts of Nigeria, three states out of 36 states, we are having incidents of terror. ""Initially, we handled it with kid-gloves but now we have decided to be a little more forceful because we must thrash out these terror groups. We must not allow it to continue to slow down economic growth in that part of the country. ""With the terror attacks in that part of the country, the rest of the country feels it because Nigerians live everywhere. In these other parts, there is always the fear that if you do not tackle it, it will infiltrate into other parts. ""We will work together to ensure that terror attack is stamped out globally and in Nigeria we are committed,"" he said Dr. Jonathan thanked Pohamba for his country's support for Nigeria's election as a non-permanent member of the United Nations (UN). Dr Jonathan on a two-day visit, stressed the need for at least two seats in the UN Security Council for Africa. ""I also believe in your philosophy that if by God's grace, the UN Security Council will be restructured, that is, if the super powers will allow it to be restructured, Africa should be considered at least for two positions to represent the interest of African people. ""I always say it that we cannot talk of democracy when the strongest institutions globally are not democratic but dictated to by one country alone. ""If we must practice democracy and emphasise that all countries must be democratic, we need to start from these powerful UN institutions that all parts of the globe must have a say there,"" he said. President Jonathan underscored the need for African leaders to promote intra-African trade for jobs creation and the development of the continent. He noted that the continent must consolidate the regional economic blocs for economic integration. ""If we can consolidate the regional economic blocs to become solid, then, we can integrate the economic blocs before going to political integration. ""I always believe that our founding fathers in the days of OAU, their vision was for Africa to become a single big continent. ""I remember the late President of Libya, Muammar Gaddafi, his dream was that political boundary should collapse for Africa. ""But we believe that it is good to envision that kind of development, but first, we must consolidate the regional economic blocs,"" he said. Pohamba said that his country would forever remain grateful to Nigeria for the contribution and sacrifice towards the attainment of independence."122,The Nation (Nigeria),3/21/2014,Jonathan: corruption blown out of proportion,,NIGERIA (99%); UNITED STATES (79%),,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,31-May-14,,1963  words,LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); REBELLIONS & INSURGENCIES (90%); WAR & CONFLICT (89%); NATIONAL SECURITY (77%); CIVIL WAR (76%); CORRUPTION (71%),"SENATORS rose yesterday in unison to seek a sustainable solution to the insecurity in some parts of the country. The upper chamber, which devoted its entire plenary to debating a motion on ""recent attacks and killings in Plateau, Benue, Kaduna and other parts of Central Nigeria"", resolved that steps should be taken to address urgently the insurgency that has claimed thousands of lives. The lawmakers are afraid that the growing insurgency in parts of the country may be a signal that Nigeria is on the verge of disintegration. A bleak future, they said, awaits the country, if nothing is done  urgently too to address the spreading virus of insurgency. For the senators, the American think-tank prediction about the possibility of Nigeria disintegrating in 2015 must not be allowed to happen. The Senate mandated its Committees on Security and Intelligence, Defence and Army, Interior and Police Affairs to undertake a fact finding mission to the affected areas and report back to it. The lawmakers also resolved to condemn ""the incessant killings occasioned by the simultaneous multiple attacks on communities and villages"". They observed a minute silence in memory of the deceased. Two prayers were, however, rejected. Thye are that the allegations of complicity by security should be probed and that the President set up a committee to look into the root cause of the sudden widespread attacks in the Middle Belt. Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu, who presided over the plenary, noted that the emerging insecurity required effective measures to tackle. ""If we decentralise the police we may be able to deal with problems of insecurity,"" he said. The touchy motion was sponsored by Senators Barnabas Gemade (Benue North East), George Akume (Benue North West), Gyang Jwajok (Plateau North), Joshua Dariye (Plateau Central), Victor Lar (Plateau South) and Nenadi Usman (Kaduna South). emade, who led the debate, noted with dismay 'how human life has become increasingly very cheap and impunity has become the norm in Nigeria, particularly in the case of the Northcentral and Northeastern geo-political zones. emade is worried that the unhealthy situation is further degenerating to a point in which ""we can clearly say that we are in the middle of a civil war with multiple ill defined fronts and worse still the perpetrators are often presented as faceless ""unknown gunmen"" ""Boko Haram"" or, in some instances, ""Fulani herdsmen"" in ""conflict"" with ""farmers"" and victims on the Plateau, in Benue, Kaduna, Nasarawa, Borno, Adamawa, Yobe states and other parts of Nigeria"" He noted that in Plateau State, between May 29, 2011 and January 31, 2012 alone there were 1,131 deaths reported. ""The relative peace and calm that had returned to the state for several months based on the collective resolve of the people to sustain the peace was sadly interrupted on Tuesday 26th of November 2013, by simultaneous multiple attacks on four communities and villages of Tatu, Rawuru, Bok and Dorang, leaving 45 people dead including a family of seven -father, mother and five children  apart from the fact that most of the poor victims are infants, children and women,"" he said. emade added: ""Aware that these well planned and organized simultaneous attacks professionally unleashed on vulnerable villages came less than 48 hours after the Governor of Plateau State Dr. Jonah David Jang publicly raised an alarm over the plot to attack the State beginning with the 2013 Christmas season and as a result these incidents cannot really be said to be as a result of total intelligence failure. ""Further aware that these serial attacks have persisted in the last two months, covering parts of Riyom, Barkin Ladi, Jos South, Mangu, Bokkos, Wase and Shendam local government areas of Plateau State with massive destruction of lives on an average five persons per day and properties worth hundreds of billions of Naira comparable to the civil war years."" The senator went on, listing attacks and casualties. He said: ""Notes that between the 21s* of May 2013  6th of March 2014, villages such as Kuka, Magama, Karkashi, Bua, Baracks, Riwam Doka, Timshab amd Yamu in Plateau South Senatorial Constituency came under vicious attacks with massive destruction of lives and property worth billions of naira ""Deeply disturbed that these attacks also took place on 5th of January 2014 at Shonong Village of Bachi District, the same area where Senator Dalyop Gyang Dantong lost his life in Riyom Local Government Area. 34 persons reportedly lost their lives and 13 injured. ""Worried that similar attacks were carried around 1:00 am on Thursday February 20, 2014 at Rapyem Village of Barkin Ladi Local Government area in which 13 people were killed, including nine children and on Friday 21 at Rakok, Razat and no fewer than 29 people were also killed by gunmen on 22nd February 2014 on border villages of Rakong near Kafi Abu between Barkin Ladi and Bokkos Local Government. 16 people including a 70-year-old, women and children, were also brutally killed and 91 houses razed down in Wereng-Rim village of Riyom Local Government Area at about 5 pm on the 4th of March 2014 ""Equally worried that in Kaduna State, it has been rough for the people of Maroa and attakad communities of Kaura Local Government Area and bordering Plateau State, as no fewer than 40 people were killed in two separate raids in which a soldier and a policeman were also slain. The daring raid of 3rd of February 2014 brought the total number of such invasions to 11 with about 100 deaths at least five villages in Mayit, Kirim, Danti, Zangang razed down and over 10,000 people displaced. At least no fewer than 114 villagers were killed in the night of Friday, March 14, 2014 when heavily armed men entered three villages of Ugwar Sankwai, Ugwan Gata and Chenshyi of Kaduna State gunning down residents burning down all the houses in sight."" emade told the Senate that survivors and eye witnesses' testimonies repeatedly raised allegations of duplicity or dereliction of duty by ""bad eggs"" within the security circles and doubts as to the capacity of the agencies to provide security. He said in Benue State incessant attacks were carried out on communities in Guma, Gwer West, Makurdi, Agatu, Kwande, Logo and Katsina Ala Local Government Areas. He said: ""In Ndzorov Ward of Guma Local Government Area, 21 reported deaths and N3bn worth of property were destroyed in villages, such as Ahor Akuroko, Tse Akaahena, Tse Ormeagh, Tse Jija, Tse Bako and Tse Iorhon. ""Also that in Mbagwa and Nyiev wards, 44 people were killed and over N5bn worth of property destroyed in Tse Kyuer, Tse Agbe, Yogbo, Tse Kulayemen, Tse Ama, Kpanye, Agela, Uhembe Ikpev, Agahar, Gbor Gyo Ubii, Hule Zem, Shan Avungu, Bern Walu Shange, Akor, Gbayange, Chenge, and Ahoile."" emade is disturbed that even more ferocious attacks were launched in the following villages in Gwer West Local Government: Sengev, Gbenda, Tongov, Tyouhater, Injaha, Nyamshi, with a death toll of 88 people and over Nlbillion worth of property destroyed. The most recent attacks in Gwer West and Guma Local Government Areas also occurred on February 20th and 21st 2014 and left over 30 people dead, including a 70-year-old woman and an estimated 100,000 people sacked and displaced while the personal house of paramount ruler of the Tiv nation, Dr Akawe Torkwula, was burnt down at Tse Torkwula."" In Agatu Local Government invasion, dozens were also killed and thousands displaced in the following villages: Okoloko, Ocholonya, Inminyi, Adana, Olejeje, Inoli, Olegoga, Olegada, Pate, Olegigeni, Ochelefu Icho, Igagishu, Olegodege, Okpanchenyi Ekwo, Warri, Ikpele, Ogwumogbo, Ogbai, Okpokpolo and Olegadakele where 83 people were killed and over N500 million property destroyed emade cited Makurdi Local Government where, he said, 70 people were killed and thousands displaced. The following villages were affected: Tye Gido, Tye Takyi, Tye Cha, Tye Tongu, Tye Anjua, Tye Azongu, Tye Ayele, Tye Ayagwa, Tye Akordam, Tye Kyase, Tye Agan, Tye Mue, Tye Kyev, Tye Tingiv, Tye Mzo, Tye Jime, Tse Adinya, Tes Akenabo, Tse Akaa, Tse Tatyongh, Tse Ajahar, Tse Madugu, Tse Nyon, Tse Kudi, Tse Akaa, and Tse Adai. Kwande and Katsina Ala villages were also attacked over N2billion property destroyed. Also, Tyobibi-Gbetim, Anybe-Azge, Genyi, Dwem, Awashua, Tse-Nyaki and Anyiin in Logo Local Government Area. Jato Aka, Yaase, Waya and Inyamate in Kwande Local Government Area as well as Sai and other communities in Yooyo Ward of Katsina Ala Local Government Area were attacked. emade noted that ""these late night guerrilla style attacks and daylight mass killings of people, sometimes not directly involved in any form of conflict, have become the hallmark of organised and specialised terror or killer groups with the resultant effect of destabilising the states and stifling the people's determination to shun violence, embrace and trust one another towards ensuring sustainable peace and collective security. In his view, ""anxiety, fed by what are now incidences of serial night killings and daylight mass attacks bordering on war crimes is approaching a panic loss of confidence in the federal security regime. Federalised policing under a unitary command may have made sense under military regimes in the past, but it is hardly the best in the prevailing situation of insecurity, with the increasing volume of grassroots crimes and attacks on the nation's defenceless rural communities,"" said the senator. emade raised the looming prospects of potential famine, ""if drastic steps are not taken to put a stop to these attacks and return the displaced persons to their homes so they can tend to their farmlands"". Ekweremadu, who summed up senators' contributions, said: ""If we have devoted the whole day as we have done now to dealing with the issue of insecurity in Nigeria, we are living up to the expectation of the ordinary people of Nigeria, for us to show concern for the general insecurity in the country."" ""So I do believe that a country as big as Nigeria needs effective security. Just as have been mentioned, it would be difficult for us to afford effective security if we continue to use the type of policing we have in Nigeria presently. ""We run a federal system of government and it is completely unacceptable in a federal system for us to have a federal system and for us to also have a centralised police. ""Policemen are not magicians. There is no way a policeman can stay in one kilometer and know when a crime is being committed in another kilometer. ""We must be able to provide sufficient police personnel that should at least be one policeman per hundred meters away. ""This can only be achieved if we decentralise our police, ensuring that we have state police and possibly local police that is well coordinated and regulated. We had problem in the past in this area because they were not well regulated and they were not coordinated. ""I think time has come for us to reflect on this and see how we can provide efficient security for our people. ""Our police, as it is now need to be more trained and then they will be able to ensure that the laws are enforced, no matter who is involved."" Ekweremadu went on: ""If we do some of these and all that we have said here, I am sure that we would be able to recover our country from the doomsday that is being predicted. But I believe, as said by Senator Thompson Sekibo, that we can overcome this challenge and be stronger again as a country."" Other Senators who contributed to the motion include Victor Lar, Enyinnaya Abaribe, Abdul Ningi, Kabiru Marafa, Zainab Kure, Solomon Ewuga, Pwajok, Abu Ibrahim, Suleiman Adokwe, Babafemi Ojudu and Mohammed Magoro.

Corruption takes the short corner to sidetrack the law and enrich the crook at the expense of the society. Terrorism sucks in innocent blood to get negative publicity or notoriety and achieve its bloody objective. Today however I want to show that both are the most dangerous and pervasive crimes and vices plaguing the civilised world as we know it today. For starters, I deliberately cast my net globally, to show that contrary to the normal chest beating of Nigerians that their nation is the most corrupt in the world just, as we once thought that Nigerians were the happiest people on earth because a US magazine said so, corruption in Nigeria may take a back seat given some of the issues on corruption we will analyse today. This does not mean that any nation can still outsmart Nigeria on vintage corruption per se. Our record here stays intact given last week end's Nigerian Immigration Service  NIS- recruitment drive in which 1m unemployed youths paid 1000 naira per application form, for a vacancy of 3000 and 18 of them died in a stampede at the Abuja National Stadium during the recruitment exercise. I doubt if any nation in the whole wide world treats its youths, the future of any nation, with such callous indifference and brutal levity resulting in the premature deaths of young people, just because they want to earn a living and fend for themselves. I wonder if any restitution can ever atone for this monumental corruption of human capital sourcing and development, which has made a dark mark on Nigeria's image amongst right thinking people in the world at large. Surely, the Minister of Interior and the NIS DG did not throw bombs but their recruitment strategy killed the flower of our youths just because they want to work under them. If that is not another form of terrorism then I need to be corrected. On stark terrorism however I still think Boko Haram remains the bloodiest and most callous terrorist group on earth given the killings of the 59 sleeping school boys in Birni Yadu. And, from all indications, their bloody stain on Nigeria's sovereign reputation remains a crimson red on the white of Nigeria's green and white flag in the comity of nations. It is in that light therefore that I will consider the Nigerian National Security Adviser's new strategic approach on counter terrorism called Soft Approach to Counter Terrorism launched this week in Nigeria. The Nigerian soft approach to terrorism as articulated by the NSA says that Boko Haram was being funded by a wealthy minority bent on creating havoc between Christians and Muslims in Nigeria and the Soft Approach to terrorism will counter that and expose Boko Haram as indeed anti Islamist. Surely this is a pragmatic approach that has my total support as it means all hands will be on deck in the North and South to ensure that Boko Haram does not disintegrate Nigeria. This approach seems in tandem with what President Goodluck Jonathan told his hosts in Windhoek , Namibia this week on a visit to that nation with his wife. The Nigerian president admitted that he had treated Boko Haram with kid gloves and explained to his hosts that the Boko Haram menace has affected only three out of Nigeria's many 36 states. While I admire the objective of the Soft Approach to terrorism as a counter terrorism strategy I pray that it will not be a continuation of the regretted kid gloves strategy that has made Boko Haram a household word for terror both in Nigeria and globally. The Soft Approach should compliment a robust and decisive military offensive that sends Boko Haram scampering like desert rats back into the arid Sahel from where it swept most unexpectedly into our Northern cities bringing blood, murder and tears. While still discussing terrorism, it will certainly astound the global business community to read what I am saying next. I am saying that Toyota of Tokyo, Japan and Boko Haram of Nigeria may be birds of the same feather. While Boko Haram is known for its bloody terrorism, no less a personality than Eric Holder the Attorney General of the US took Toyota to the cleaners for the mendacity of its corporate leaders in covering up mistakes on its floor mats and brakes of Toyota brands, which led to unintended acceleration and threatened the safety of millions of global Toyota car buyers and users. At the end Toyota admitted hiding safety defects on its cars between 2009 and 2010 and paid a whopping $1.2 bn to the US authorities to prevent further litigation and prosecution on the matter. Car makers making mechanical mistakes leading to recalls can be a dangerous night mare for car buyers not to talk of trying to cover up at the expense of the safety of millions of innocent car buyers. Buying the Toyota brand all over the world. Is this not case of corporate corruption tinged with some form of corporate terrorism.? I wonder if a recall is sufficient restitution in this regard as the buyer is denied usage of the car which has not lived up to the buyers' expectation at the time of purchase, thereby casting a doubt on the integrity of the Toyota brand. Definitely the huge fine would be a deterrent but it should have been used to reinforce customer service and product quality at Toyota, and not lying idle at the US Ministry of Justice. Talking of idle funds reminds me of the story I read about a suit by the Bayelsa State government, asking the EFCC to return the money  1.4 bn naira  seized from the former Governor of the state, Diprieye Alamieyesagha, to the coffers of the Bayelsa State. Now, to refresh our memory, this was the Governor that the incumbent President of Nigeria succeeded as Governor after the ex Governor was arrested and tried for money laundering and jailed abroad from where he escaped dressed like a woman to Nigeria. Now the money seized was for embezzlement and corruption and his state is asking for the return of the money as belonging to the state in, what looks like a genuine restitution. But the former Governor is said to be about the most influential politician in the state for now. So it is easy to see the destination of the Bayelsa returned money and restitution. And yet Nigeria is fighting corruption tooth and nail according to government spokesmen. Still on the fight against corruption, it is nice to know that as at the time the Centenary Celebration was going in Nigeria, some US attorneys released details of the stolen money stashed away in foreign accounts by former head of state ex General Sanni Abacha. I read then that the president said that the former military ruler was honoured with a Nigerian Centenary Award because the nation made the greatest economic growth during his tenure, hence the award. I find this very unacceptable for the simple fact that many books on money laundering and finance have always mentioned the kleptocracy and profligacy of the Abacha regime in a way that is shameful to the Nigerian nation. Such facts should be sufficient to keep Abacha's name out of any Centenary's Honor List. To now use economic growth as an index of performance and honor for him, is to white wash looting and embezzlement and give a bad name to Nigeria in the comity of nations in terms of measurement and recognition of transparency, integrity and public accountability. However as I mentioned before corruption is not Nigerian disease alone and I want to look at S /Africa and Guatemala in this regard. In S/Africa the anti corruption czar has accused the incumbent President Jacob Zuma of using about $23.4m of state funds unethically to renovate his rural residence where he added a ranch and other facilities recently. This revelation has come near election time in May and Zuma's party, the ANC is still expected to win. This is not because S/Africans condone corruption as in Nigeria but for the simple reason that the ANC is the party of Nelson Mandela and is able to win 80% of the votes cast in any election in that nation anytime. But definitely President Zuma will sit up and I expect him to offer some restitution but since this is his final second term he will have to continue in office with his head bowed while still exercising power. But then I doff my hat to the brave S /African anti corruption chief for stating the facts so loud and clear, no matter whose ox is gored. In Guatemala however Alfonso Portillo a former head of state from 2000 to 2004 who stashed stolen money in the US was not so lucky as the US authorities not only exposed him but tried and jailed him for taking a $2.5m bribe while in office to recognise Taiwan. Now you have to wonder why and how a president in Latin America can take bribe over the recognition of a foreign nation in Asia and think that the world of diplomacy and the international community will not know. The man being a president could not have been broke. This obviously shows how greed can fan the acquisitive tendencies of powerful people such that it gets to a stage that they cannot resist the challenge of taking or stealing what is not theirs or stop doing what is illegal in the hope that detection will not be their lot. Surely for this former Guatemalan president the lesson to learn is that though the mills of justice may grind slowly, they grind exceedingly fine."124,The Nation (Nigeria),3/23/2014,CorruptionŒæandŒæunemployment,,NIGERIA (98%),,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,31-May-14,,351  words,CORRUPTION (90%); JOB CREATION (78%); EMPLOYMENT SEARCH (78%); UNEMPLOYED PERSONS (78%); UNEMPLOYMENT RATES (77%); FINANCIAL CRIME COUNTERMEASURES (70%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (70%); OIL & GAS INDUSTRY (69%); IMMIGRATION (56%); PLANT CONSTRUCTION (53%),"SIR: When will Nigerians learn that the people governing this country do not care or love the citizens? In this time and age where recruitment can be done via the internet, an agency of government instead, decides to conduct a paper based test for thousands of suffering unemployed graduates. The sad menace of unemployment manifested during the Nigeria Immigration Service recruitment, resulting in many deaths and becoming a national embarrassment. The unfortunate deaths of many of our youths during the exercise demonstrated corruption at its best. The desperation of more than 693,000 youths to secure a job meant for 4,000 people represents the catastrophic nature of the country today. For crying out loud, Nigeria is said to be the sixth largest oil producer in the world but ironically, has more unemployed people than employed. This is sad. Recently, the suspended governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi said NNPC had not accounted for $20 billion. This money could have been used to build factories in different states and create job opportunities for youths. The question is how can the nation move forward when our leaders are conniving to steal and loot our commonwealth? The time has come for Nigerians to join forces with anti-graft agencies, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission and others to flush out these termites that have eaten deep into the root of the nation. With what the EFCC has achieved since its establishment, if it is fully supported by the government and the people, corruption can be reduced to the barest minimum, which will be better for us all. It is time for the masses to stop celebrating these thieves who gives them peanuts when we can all enjoy much more.

With all due respect, the body has succeeded in sullying its image as the highest decision making organ of the Nigerian judiciary, despite the public optimism that ushered in its head and Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Aloma Mukhtar, when in 2012 she became the first female CJN and promised reforms and sanitisation of the judiciary. However, this expectation has come into question following recent developments that put NJC in a negative light. Top of the unflattering issues is perhaps the apparently unresolved matter involving the Rivers State Chief Judge, Peter Agumagu, who was sworn in by the governor, Rotimi Amaechi, on March 18, contrary to the NJC's stance backing Justice Daisy Okocha for the position on the basis of being the most senior judge in the state judiciary. It is noteworthy that Amaechi formalised Agumagu's appointment after a Federal High Court ruling by Justice Lambo Akanbi, who declared, ""With greatest respect to the National Judicial Commission, who is my employer, I cannot allow the argument of the defence counsel that the governor must accept the recommendation of the NJC."" According to the judge, ""The body that is most suitable to make recommendation of a nominee as a chief judge of the state is the state Judicial Service Commission (SJC) because they have local knowledge of the most suitable candidate than the National Judicial Commission."" Moreover, he stated, it was not mandatory under Nigerian law that the most senior judge be appointed the state's chief judge, adding that the official qualification was that the concerned individual must have spent at least 10 years on the bench. Since Agumagu, who was then the President of the Rivers Customary Appeal Court met this qualification, there was no issue about his appointment, he reasoned. Certainly, if the NJC had a problem with the judgment, it was expected to follow the path of the law, being itself a symbol of the law, with all the implications of truth and fairness. Amazingly, however, the NJC not only announced the suspension of Agumagu for alleged disobedience it also reportedly queried Justice Akanbi. That is how things stand now, which is not easy to understand. What made the NJC's moves particularly puzzling and even disturbing is the fact that it appeared to have disappointingly contradicted itself, given that in the same period it had supposedly demonstrated a sense of fair dealing that was evidently missing in the case of Agumagu and Akanbi. To be specific, it was the same body that recommended to President Goodluck Jonathan the compulsory retirement from office of Justice G.K. Olotu of the Federal High Court and Justice U.A. Inyang of the High Court of Justice of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, ""for gross misconduct."" Also, it was the same body that queried Justice Danlami Senchi of the Abuja High Court and issued warning letters to Justice Dalhatu Adamu, the Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeal, Kaduna Division Justice A.A. Adeleye of the High Court of Justice, Ekiti State and Justice D.O. Amaechina of the High Court of Justice, Anambra State. Now, with the benefit of insight into the seeming corruption of justice in Rivers State, it would appear that the NJC may not be beyond reasonable doubt concerning some of its actions after all."128,The Nation (Nigeria),6/2/2014,2022 World Cup: Corruption allegation unfounded Hayatou,,NIGERIA (92%); QATAR (90%); CAMEROON (79%); UNITED KINGDOM (73%),,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,2-Jun-14,"DOHA, QATAR (72%)",257  words,CORRUPTION (92%); SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (90%); SPORTS GOVERNING BODIES (90%); SOCCER (90%); SPORTS & RECREATION (90%); BRIBERY (90%); SPORTS AWARDS (90%); SOCCER TOURNAMENTS (90%),"The President of the Confederation of African Football, Issa Hayatou, has denied allegations of corruption published in the Sunday Times of United Kingdom on June 1.

The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Qatar's World Cup bid win had been marred by allegations of corruption, with Hammam said to have made five million dollars payment in total for votes. The statement said the Sunday Times' publication claimed Hayatou might have received valuable gifts from Hammam and had been greatly pampered"" during a tour of Doha in December 2009. The publication also alleged that Hammam during his time in the committee of the FIFA Goal Project favoured the Cameroonian federation with a project worth 400,000 dollars in exchange for votes. The CAF president never attended events from invitations of Hammam either in Doha or Kuala Lumpur. Yet the allegation `demonstrated cruel ignorance' of the functions of FIFA bodies. In FIFA committees, decisions are not taken by presidents of the committees unilaterally but are collective decisions.

Ijaw leader and one time Federal Commissioner of Information, Chief Edwin Clark, made these allegations on Tuesday in Abuja while briefing journalists on the state of emergency in the three states. Clark noted that after watching the minister for a while, he came to the occlusion that he has not done enough in the fight against corruption, stressing that as the attorney General of the federation, he ought to strengthen the judicial process. He said: Before I took this decision, I have been too patent. I have watched him for so long. In most cases he has not done well. He has not given the President good advice. On the issue of corruption, he has not done well. A good attorney General would give strength to the administration by ensuring that corruption cases are fully prosecuted."" On the role of the minister on the declaration of partial state of emergency in the Boko Haram burdened states, the elder statesman said, the minister misadvised the President by citing the case of Governor Joseph Dariye of Plateau State.

EFCC's Head of Media and Publicity, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, addressed reporters yesterday in Abuja on the activities of the commission since March. Uwujaren responded to questions on high-profile cases the EFCC had been handling. On the quizzing of Ms Oduah for alleged N255 million bulletproof cars' scam, the EFCC spokesman said the commission was still conducting investigations. He said: ""I recall, during my last briefing, I craved your indulgence to be patient with the commission. At that time, she (Ms Oduah) had not even been invited to appear before the commission.

""If the umpire believes that the electoral law allows such a person standing trial in court, even though he has not been convicted to stand for election, that is the job of the INEC it is not for EFCC to decide. ""Fayose, for your information, is still standing trial on corruption charges before the Federal High Court. That case has been on since 2007.

So, that matter is still fresh and he has not been cleared, the case is still in court. ""But by Nigerian Judicial tradition, we assume that he is innocent until proven guilty in court and we cannot at this moment convict him until the court decides."" On alleged ongoing investigation of 14 serving governors, Uwujaren said: "" I don't know where you got the figure of 12 or 14 governors. I do not have any information on that.

It has also recovered about N6.53 billion from evaders of customs duties at the Lagos ports. EFCC's Head of Media and Publicity, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, addressed reporters yesterday in Abuja on the agency's activities between March and June. The spokesman said some Internet fraudsters had been arrested and prosecuted. He said Jesse Omokoh, who allegedly obtained $90,000 from a 67-year-old Australian, Jette Jacobs, in a romance scam, is on trial at an High Court in Ibadan, Oyo State. ut the agency's biggest hauls were in its war against theft in the Oil sector. The breakdown of the figures showed that 17 oil marketers, 23 oil marketing companies and 81 suspects have been arraigned for alleged oil theft. The commission has also seized 11 tanker vessels and 16 tanker trucks used for alleged oil theft. Uwujaren said: Oil subsidy scam: As we speak, I think there are about 17 oil marketers that are being tried, and I am talking of persons who are being tried in court over subsidy scam. ut if you add the individuals and their companies, we have over 40 cases on trial for obtaining subsidy from the Federal Government without supplying products. Those cases are ongoing they are progressing in court at different stages. Apart from the one we have in court, there are also a number of investigations that are going on. Investigation of subsidy is not a straight-forward thing it is a very complicated procedure. It is not something you can just conclude within a country you have to deal with organisations with proper jurisdiction, and these things take time. That is reason some people think we don't have enough people standing trial in court. It is a complicated procedure, and that process is still on. In terms of whether or not we have recovered money from the subsidy thing, I say yes. I recall that about two months ago, the Executive Chairman of the EFCC announced that the commission had recovered N4.3 billion from the subsidy scam. That is very significant, considering the complicated nature of those transactions. We are not relenting in our determination to get to the root of the matter."" On how the EFCC collaborated with other security agencies to fight oil thieves in the Niger Delta, Uwujaren said: Oil theft is a subject that is of concern to every Nigerian. For us as a commission with a mandate to check oil theft by arresting and prosecuting offenders, I'll like to report that commendable strides have been recorded in checking this menace. Of course, what we have done in this area could not have been possible without the assistance of sister-law enforcement organisations, notably the Navy and the Army. For some of you, who want hard statistics on the records of the commission in fighting oil theft in the Niger Delta, it is my pleasure to report that the commission, from January 2013 till date, investigated 21 cases of crude oil theft. Eleven tanker vessels and 16 tanker trucks were recovered, while 81 suspects have been charged to court. A few weeks ago, two Indians  Sailesh Kumar Singh and Chadrashekar Sharma  were jailed after successful prosecution by the commission for oil theft. The two were among the 12 suspected oil thieves arrested in Brass, Bayelsa State, in 2012 by the Joint Task Force (JTF) with 157,882 litres of suspected stolen crude oil. They are to serve 15 years imprisonment. This should serve as a deterrent for others still engaged in the nefarious trade."" On evaders of import duties, Uwujaren said a large-scale investigation on the scandal at the ports led to the recovery of N6.53 billion unpaid Customs importation duties in Lagos. The EFCC spokesman said the battle had shifted to Onne Port in Rivers State against duty evaders. He said: The desire to encourage local collaboration and erase unnecessary rivalries in law enforcement is the bedrock of our cooperation with the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS). Our joint recovery team in Lagos recovered N6.53 billion evaded Customs importation duties in Lagos between July 2012 and March 2014. Another joint recovery has began operations at Onne in Port Harcourt in April 2014 to recover Customs' revenue in the Southsouth. We will be briefing you in the future on the outcome of this exercise."" Uwujaren said the EFCC had been unrelenting to stamp out Internet crime. He added: Several cases were brought to trial in the last couple of weeks. First is the arraignment and conviction in Kano of Daniel Okpara, who defrauded people through a facebook account he opened in the name of the Executive Chairman of EFCC, Mr. Ibrahim Lamorde. Okpara lured his victims by promising them jobs with the commission. As we speak, he is in prison, serving a three-year jail term. Early this month, the commission arraigned at an Ibadan High Court, a suspected Internet fraudster, Jesse Omokoh, who allegedly obtained $90,000 from a 67-year old Australian, Jette Jacobs, in a romance scam. Omokoh, 28, allegedly met the lady in an online dating site and struck a relationship with a promise to marry the woman. The lady relocated from Australia to South Africa in November and the accused left Nigeria to meet her in Johannesburg on February 4, 2013. Unfortunately, five days later, she was found dead in her apartment."" The EFCC spokesman said the accused fled South Africa but was arrested by the EFCC because of the collaboration it has with the Australian police. Also, Uwujaren said officers of the commission were recently in Australia and Spain, where they worked with their counterparts at the West Australia and Spanish National Police. Such engagements enable us to assist the host agencies in pending trans-national investigations, while exposing our staff to international best practices,"" he said. According to him, the commission has also hosted investigators and prosecutors from Zambia, the United States (U.S), the United Kingdom (UK), the Netherlands, Niger, World Bank and Africa Development Bank (ADB) and signed international memoranda of understanding (MoU) or joint working agreements. Other international partners, such as the British Serious Fraud Office, the Economic Crimes Network (New Zealand) the Global Fund, the United States Trade Commission, the World Bank and a host of others had also been sealed.

""The Nigeria Judiciary can no longer condone indolence, ineptitude, corruption or any form of judicial misconduct. As new judicial officers, your future is in your hands. Do your work well and you will have nothing to fear, but a lot to gain. ""However, if you choose the corrupt and dishonourable way or become indolent and unproductive, more of a liability than an asset, you can only have yourself to blame because the consequences will not be pleasing, though deserving."" Eri, who regretted the negative impact of corruption on the country and its people, urged judges to support efforts to rid the society of corruption and other vices by shunning corrupt acts themselves.

She wondered why so many of them would agree to represent a judge who has been accused of graft at a mere disciplinary hearing of the National Judicial Council (NJC). ""I think the SANs are equally guilty,"" Justice Mukhtar said. The CJN spoke yesterday in Abuja at the opening ceremony of a three-day Judicial Reforms Conference, with the theme: Putting Our Best Foot Forward: The Judiciary and the Challenges of Satisfying Justice Needs of the 21st Century. It was jointly organised by the Nigerian Bar Association's (NBA's) Judiciary Committee, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and Access to Justice, with the support of Open Society Initiative for West Africa and the NJC's Performance Evaluation Committee. Justice Mukhtar noted that such SANs must be ""working in tandem"" with the judges under probe. According to her, corruption remains the Judiciary's major problem and NJC ensures that judges found culpable ""are shown the way out"". She said: ""Corruption has become a real cankerworm that has refused to depart. We receive petitions and we have always tried to hear from both sides because many times, many affected judges complain that they are not given fair hearing. ""Some judges come with as many as six SANs to defend them. I think the SANs are equally guilty. There was one that came with about six SANS, which showed they were working in tandem."" The CJN said many lawyers were quick to accuse the Judiciary of being corrupt, yet refuse to report corrupt judges to the NJC. Justice Mukhtar said: ""You (lawyers) all know those judges that are corrupt. You all do but you won't report. You will be the one who will raise the issue that the Judiciary is corrupt, but you will not do your part."" On independence of the Judiciary, the CJN said insufficient funding should not be an excuse for a Chief Judge to make a ""nuisance"" of himself at a Government House. ""I tell chief judges to manage what they have. Chief judges should maintain a distance. We should try as much as possible to resist interference from the two other arms of government. The constitution guarantees our independence and we should strive to establish this,"" she said. Chief Justice of South Africa, Justice Mogoeng Reetsang Mogoeng, said the Judiciary has what it takes to lead in the turnaround of Africa's image. He urged the Judiciary to be ""ruthless"" in dealing with corruption, adding that this was the only way it could develop the moral courage to deal with corruption in the society. ""If there is one institution that can demonstrate that power can be exercised without corruption, it is the Judiciary. We have to start it. Only then can we deal as harshly as possible with corrupt people when they're brought before us,"" Mogoeng said. NBA President Okey Wali (SAN) said: ""The government must recognise that the Judiciary is the third arm of government."" He urged the Federal Government to obey a recent judgment of the Federal High Court, Abuja, which ordered that the Judiciary be funded directly rather than through the Executive. ""The NBA reiterates that government must recognise that it is only existence of a virile, fearless and independent judiciary that can guarantee an enduring democratic government and the maintenance of law and order,"" Wali added."135,The Nation (Nigeria),7/11/2014,Maigari's board denies corruption allegations,,NIGERIA (93%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%); AFRICA (73%),,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,10-Jul-14,,748  words,SOCCER TOURNAMENTS (91%); SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (90%); SPORTS GOVERNING BODIES (90%); SPORTS & RECREATION (90%); SPORTS (90%); SOCCER (89%); SPORTS AWARDS (89%); FIFA WORLD CUP (89%); CORRUPTION (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); CULTURE DEPARTMENTS (73%); TALKS & MEETINGS (73%); COACHES & TRAINERS (73%),"The embattled Aminu Maigari-led Executive Board of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has said that all the allegations levelled against it are false, unfounded and a plot to destroy all the remarkable successes it recorded in the past four years by forces opposed to the leadership of the football house. A prominent member of the NFF Executive Board, who pleaded anonymity, has risen in strong defense of the federation in the face of an avalanche of financial impropriety allegations levelled against it by the so-called ''NFF Emergency Congress''. He vehemently denied the allegations that board members partook in the sharing of the Super Eagles' Brazil 2014 FIFA World Cup largesse of $3.6 million from the Federal Government. According to him, 'The Sports Minister personally brought the money in question to Brazil and delivered it directly to the players and officials. No board member got a dime. lt is a case of giving a dog a bad name to hang it.'' The outspoken board member also refuted another allegation that the sum of $90,000 got missing inside the aircraft conveying the Flying Eagles to a competition last year. He insisted that nothing of such ever happened. On the issue of the Super Eagles' quarrel over the FIFA World Cup participation money, he stated that both players and officials held a meeting where the players and coaching staff were told what they would get ahead of time just as they were also reminded that such money from FIFA comes two months after the competition. Said he, 'the truth is that the board adequately briefed the players and officials on the FIFA largesse and it was explained that the money only comes months after the World Cup. It is therefore arrant nonsense any talk that the board denied the players what is due to them.'' According to the prominent NFF figure, all the allegations were totally untrue as the Maigari-led NFF Executive Board and its management staff had been very prudent in the handling of the finances of the federation vis-a-viz the numerous programmes the NFF executed in the years under review. ''It is very unfortunate that all manner of allegations are being brandished by those who are envious of the landmark achievements recorded by this present board. Need I recount that this board worked very hard to ensure that Nigeria won the coveted African Nations Cup in South Africa after 20 years of waiting even as the Golden Eaglets lifted again the FIFA U-17 World Cup in UAE last year, while all our other national football teams did the country proud at every competition to warrant President Goodluck Jonathan playing host to the victorious teams as many times as possible this past four years'', the top official said. He, however, commended President Jonathan for his unflinching support for the NFF and the national teams even as he restated the board's appreciation to Mr. President and all Nigerians for the support of the Super Eagles in Brazil. The respected board member refuted the allegations that money was missing or misappropriated, arguing that the board was made up of responsible Nigerians who followed laid down procedures in every transaction, especially when money was involved, hence the board was more than ready to render account of its stewardship in the fullness of time. Said he, ''Let me make it clear that monies received from the Federal Government in the form of subvention or allocation will be fully accounted for while all the gray areas will be cleared to the last kobo. In fact, the board is ready to defend itself and to clear any doubt in the minds of the public who may have been deceived by some misguided individuals who want to rubbish whatever achievement this board has recorded.'' On the suspension of Nigeria by the Federation of International Football Association (FIFA) following the purported 'sacking' of the NFF board, the football administrator argued that this was the direct consequence of the court action brought upon the NFF by a stakeholder and the subsequent purported sacking of the board at the hurriedly called ''NFF Emergency Congress'' in Abuja afterwards. ''l am pained by the turn of events. My view is that we should have waited till the NFF August General Election to effect the leadership change if it's necessary. One more month will not kill anybody. We are in a democracy. FIFA preaches democracy. You see, illegality cannot beget illegality. Those who claimed that they 'sacked' the Maigari-led board should have waited for awhile,"" he concluded."136,The Nation (Nigeria),7/28/2014,Nigerian lawyer suspended for accusing U.S judges of corruption,,UNITED STATES (95%); NIGERIA (94%),,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,"ILLINOIS, USA (95%)",28-Jul-14,"SPRINGFIELD, IL, USA (90%); CHICAGO, IL, USA (88%)",747  words,LAWYERS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT (89%); SUPREME COURTS (89%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (89%); DISCRIMINATION (89%); TESTIMONY (88%); ADMISSION TO PRACTICE LAW (78%); SUITS & CLAIMS (78%); WITNESSES (78%); JUDGES (78%); LITIGATION (78%); LEGAL MALPRACTICE (78%); DISBARMENT (78%); LIBEL & SLANDER (78%); LEGAL ETHICS (78%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (77%); LICENSES & PERMITS (77%); RACISM & XENOPHOBIA (75%); RACE & RACISM (75%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (74%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (74%); LAW SCHOOLS (73%); VERDICTS (73%); CIVIL ENGINEERING (71%); GRADUATE & PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS (71%); ENGINEERING (71%); INSURANCE (70%); PERSONAL INJURY (64%),"For several months, a Nigerian lawyer in Chicago, Illinois, United States, Mr Lanre Amu, tried to get the attention of the American media but no one was willing to tell his story or help him get his law licence back. Amu moved to the U.S in 1982 with the hope of living the American dream. At the beginning, he enjoyed this dream, earning Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Civil Engineering with distinction. He worked as an engineer in Illinois. Later, he attended the John Marshall Law School in Chicago and became a popular lawyer, representing minority immigrants, especially those not educated in America. After 16 years of practice, his American dream became a nightmare in August 2013. Amu got a phone call that his licence had been suspended for three years until an order of the court. ""I got a phone call that I was suspended from the practice of law immediately. I couldn't believe it. They said I defamed four judges because of the complaints I filed against them over nine years,"" he said. The call came after his long battle with four judges he accused of corruption. Between 2004 and 2011, Amu filed complaints about four Cook County Circuit Court judges he alleged had compromised in their verdicts against his clients but in favour of rich insurance companies. The judges are: Lynn M. Egan, Irwin S. Solganick, Francis J. Dolan, and Thomas R. Chiola. His first complaint in 2004 was against Judge Dolan, who barred witnesses from testifying against a company Amu's clients had sued. Amu also accused Judge Egan of racial discrimination and corruption after she vacated a default judgment against his client in a personal injury case against a food store. The lawyer insisted that the case was fixed, alleging that the judge's brother worked at a law firm hired by the store's insurance company to defend it against the suit. In 2011, Amu's accusations were ruled as ""false"", ""unfounded"", ""baseless,"" and in violation of Illinois Supreme Court rules by the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission (ARDC), an agency of the Illinois Supreme Court. A hearing followed and the ARDC administrator advised the Hearing Board to recommend that Amu be disbarred from law practice. But the panel recommended a three-year suspension. The case proceeded to the Supreme Court and, after several months, Amu was officially suspended in 2013 for three years until further order of the court. The lawyer said none of the judges testified against him while the battle was going on. Yet, he was suspended. He believes as an African immigrant and a minority black lawyer, he is a victim of racial discrimination. When The Nation contacted the ARDC about his story, we received an email from their media representative, who said the ARDC does not comment on past or pending cases, except to give background information. ""The Court declined to take Mr. Amu's exceptions (an appeal) from an earlier board's recommendation that he be suspended for three years and until further order of the court,"" said James J. Grogan, the media representative for the ARDC. ""The provision of a suspension 'until further order of the court' is significant because, at the end of the suspension period, the lawyer suspended must file a petition for reinstatement and establish rehabilitation after a hearing."" Also, Amu, who once represented hundreds of minority clients, said he was left to find other means of survival. ""Things have been difficult financially, as you would expect once a person's means of livelihood is interrupted,"" he said. One of his clients, Koami Agbezouhlon from Togo, told The Nation that Amu is the top black lawyer he knows that defends minorities in Chicago area. He said the lawyer's suspension also affected a lot of minority immigrants. ""This is injustice. They knew that Amu was defending the innocent people like me. But now, judges are lying, and it's not fair. The system is corrupted something must be done. ""This is a sensitive issue because it involves judges. But somebody must hear his side of the story and do proper investigation. He feels completely cheated, and something should be done,"" said another client of the lawyer from Ghana, who spoke in confidence. In a YouTube video, titled: Judicial Corruption in IL., Amu was granted his first interview by a cable station. There, he details the events leading to his suspension. He hoped thousands would watch it and know there is corruption even in the American judicial system. Amu continues to hope for justice."137,The Nation (Nigeria),8/4/2014,"Osun election, corruption top Abba's challenges",,NIGERIA (94%),,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,3-Aug-14,"LAGOS, NIGERIA (91%)",2072  words,CORRUPTION (91%); ELECTION FRAUD (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (89%); INDICTMENTS (88%); EXTORTION (78%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); BRIBERY (78%); POLICE FORCES (78%); POLICE MISCONDUCT (78%); ELECTIONS (72%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (72%); MURDER (68%); KIDNAPPING & ABDUCTION (68%); INDUSTRY ANALYSTS (63%),"Like other sectors of the society, the police have battled corruption. This is one of the challenges facing the acting Inspector General of Police Suleiman Abba. Many will be watching out for how he handles the general elections, especially the Osun governorship poll, writes JUDE ISIGUZO Some years back, a retired Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police was a Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in a police station on Lagos mainland. He made any policeman posted to his station to sign an undertaking that he or she would not be corrupt. The retired DIG documented this undertaking in a file. On the other hand, he set a target for the policeman on how much money they were expected to bring to him at the end of every week. He warned his men to ensure that they were not caught extorting money from members of the public by the Police Monitoring Unit, a department responsible for arresting corrupt policemen, as he would deny them using their undertaking as evidence. A policeman, who worked with the retired DIG, said: Some week when we did not meet our target, we borrowed money from members of the Nigerian Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) and filling station attendants to make up because he would not listen to any excuse. All he cared about was his returns. Those that were caught in trying to meet with their target he denied them by presenting the undertaking that was signed by the affected policeman. He would go on to tell the Monitoring team how he hated corruption and corrupt policemen and that was why he made them sign an undertaking before they would start working with him."" Corruption in the police, according to analysts, is the number one challenge before acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) Sulaiman Abba. Favouritism is another problem analysts have identified as dragging down the force. There are police officers and men who have been serving in a Divisional Police Station, Mobile Police Squadrons, command, units and Departments for a decade. These officers are so rich that they have the money to bribe their superiors to leave them where they are serving. Abba should discourage such practice and ensure that all policemen under him and in his time should enjoy equal right. This will discourage corruption. Abba should also continue with the no road block order introduced by his predecessor as it has reduced incidents of accidental discharge, harassment and intimidation of members of the public on the highway. Another issue the new IGP needs to address is that of covering up police officers and men who have been indicted for stealing from members of the public. Many a time, police officers had turned complainants to accused, converted belongings of a suspect while investigation is ongoing and are even indicted for kidnap and murder. Rather than punish these officers, some of them have even been celebrated and promoted. Cases abound. A former CP in Abia and Rivers states, who is now an Assistant Inspector General (AIG), was indicted while serving as CP Rivers for stealing three exotic cars belonging to an accused person while investigation was still ongoing. He was alleged to have converted one of the cars to personal use and sold the other two to his friends at a ridiculous price. The accused petitioned the Special Fraud Unit and the case was re-investigated and the CP indicted. But rather than punish him, the CP was promoted to the rank of AIG. Divisional Police Officers have been indicted for allegedly killing innocent citizens in Lagos, Abuja and other parts of the country but at the end of the day, nothing comes out of the investigations. Abba should discourage this practice. Welfare is one area Abba really needs to address and fast too. Policemen should be encouraged to make them see their job as service to humanity and not a licence to oppress, intimidate and extort members of the public. When the Chairman of Police Service Commission, Mr Mike Okiro was appointed as the 13th indigenous IGP, he wept on his visit to inspect police barracks in Ikeja, the Lagos State capital and Elere in Agege, on the outskirts of Lagos. Though the renovation of those barracks that he promised was never acted upon up till date, he was able to lay a foundation for a police estate in Idimu. A flat in the estate, which is supposed to be for junior officers, is being sold for N8million. Where the force high command expects the junior officers to raise this amount from is what only they can answer. Abba should learn to march words with action by renovating the barracks if he cannot construct new ones. Salaries should be increased promotions should come as at when due those on special duties should be paid their allowances and retire officers and men should get their entitlements immediately after leaving service. Family members of deceased officers and men must be paid their breadwinners' entitlement promptly. Abba should train and re-train his men and equip the forensic department in Alagbon to handle high level investigations. The first litmus test for Abba would be the conduct of the Osun State governorship election coming up on August 9. Nigerian are watching and expecting that Abba will not be partisan. He should be objective in his dealings with all the political parties involved to ensure a professional conduct. In a letter to the acting IGP through its national coordinator, Okechukwu Nwanguma , Network on Police Reform in Nigeria (NOPRIN), a network of 46 civil society organisations committed to promoting police accountability and respect for human rights, said: We are fully appraised of the fact that the tasks confronting you as Inspector General of a large police force are enormous and daunting. The challenge of managing such an unwieldy and centralised police force in a populous, complex and troubled country is made even more herculean by historical, institutional and structural problems, as well as other factors external to the force and, therefore, beyond your control as the chief of police. NOPRIN and other civil society platforms have over the years continued to advocate for reforms aimed at transforming the police into a professionally effective, democratic, accountable and people-friendly service organisation which enjoys public confidence and cooperation and capable of meeting the safety and security needs of the community it serves. Over the years, the NPF has grappled with the problem of severe under-resourcing. We are also aware that budget allocations for the police are pilfered at various levels in the line of bureaucracy before they reach their final destination. A compromised and corruption-ridden recruitment process allows misfits and criminals to find their way into the police and continue to dent its image. The police force continues to parade a poorly trained, ill-equipped, badly paid and ill-motivated workforce that is prone to corruption and violence. Professionalism, effectiveness and integrity are hindered by political interference by political authorities that have no more than rhetorical commitment to police reform. However, while these external incapacitating factors are not within the control of the IGP, there still remains some space for any IGP who is genuinely committed to reform to show leadership. With determination, you can creatively exercise powers and ensure that things within your control in the system work well. We believe that with commitment and determination, you can improve in the areas where your predecessors have not fared very well. You can, for example, make it clear to police officers that their duty is to serve and protect their communities and not to prey on them. Police officers ought to be protectors, not predators. Human rights abuses breed public resentment and erode public trust and cooperation. You must constantly remind them of the  obvious that the duties of the Nigeria Police Force are a direct consequence of the powers conferred on it by law. It becomes mandatory that the law must regulate the performance of its duties relating to arrest, detention, search, and seizure and the use of force. In other words, these duties must be exercised strictly within the limits prescribed for the Police by law. And any form of exercise of these powers which does not strictly conform to the prescriptions of the law can have unpleasant consequences for the Police Force (as a corporate entity, as well as for the individual Police personnel).'You can make it clear from the onset that your administration will not tolerate human rights abuses, corruption, disobedience of court orders, violation of the constitution and subversion of the due process and rule of law. As you settle down and familiarise yourself with your new office and the tasks ahead, we wish to draw your attention to some areas we respectfully think you need to pay particular attention. The NPF stinks and you need to demonstrate your commitment to sanitise it by addressing the following specific issues. Where necessary, we will illustrate with some specific cases which we had earlier brought to the attention of your predecessor, but which remain pending or unresolved. How you address these cases that touch directly on the image, integrity and operational efficiency of the police will be a litmus test to your commitment to leave the NPF better than you met it as IGP. You need to prioritise respect for human rights which impinges on police-public relations. You have to, perforce, vigorously pursue and promote an anti-corruption policy. Then, you must take seriously the issue of accountability for police abuse, corruption and misconduct. You must equally address, very seriously, the welfare of personnel. Failure of Accountability: Impunity for police abuses Lack of effective accountability measures to sanction and deter police misconduct accounts for the increasing number of cases of abuse and misconduct. One case, among the numerous, that illustrates impunity is the continued indefinite detention of Chinagorom Ihejiagwa by SARS Awkuzu, Anambra State in disregard of a court order. This is one of the several complaints which NOPRIN received and brought to the attention of police authorities but which has remained untreated. NOPRIN had written several complaints to the former IGP concerning these abuses by SARS, many of which have been reported in several newspapers. But the authorities have failed to address these complaints and the underlying causes of the abuses which make them routine. One of the very dangerous practices portraying the police in a very negative light and which you must address urgently is police contempt and disregard for Court Orders. You must take steps to change the attitude of the police to court orders. Ihejiagwa was arrested by SARS Awkuzu and has been detained since May 31, 2014. He has been denied access to his family members and his lawyers. The O/C SARS has also refused to charge him to court. He was arrested by one police officer attached to Awkuzu SARS and simply identified as Pele'. Although Pele' accused him of buying a stolen vehicle two years ago and refused to settle' him, the O/C SARS, Awkuzu, Mr. James Nwafor later told Chiagorom's brother that he is a confessed kidnapper' and that we will kill him'. We call on you to demonstrate that the Nigeria Police under your administration will do away with the odious practice of shielding criminals and covering up crime and that you will show sensitivity to public concerns by responding to public demand for justice in this case. Please, do not allow this matter to be swept under the carpet. The issue of Police personnel welfare, you must make bold to make a strong case for an increase in the remuneration and allowances of officers. Salaries and allowances must be paid in full and on time. Those on special duties must be catered for in terms of their travel, accommodation, hazard and other allowances. Family members of police officers who die in line of duty must be treated with fairness and compassion. Their deceased breadwinners' entitlements must be released to them in full and on time. They must not be thrown out of the barracks while the police force owes them their entitlements. You must also make bold to let the Federal Government understand your operational challenges and the need for the government to adequately equip, train and motivate personnel to enable them discharge their functions and effectively deal with crime and insecurity."""139,The Nation (Nigeria),8/11/2014,"CJN to chair book launch on corruption, human rights law in Africa",,NIGERIA (94%); AFRICA (93%); WESTERN AFRICA (91%),,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,10-Aug-14,"LAGOS, NIGERIA (90%); LONDON, ENGLAND (71%)",181  words,CORRUPTION (91%); HUMAN RIGHTS (90%); EXECUTIVES (78%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (77%); FINANCIAL CRIME COUNTERMEASURES (77%); LAW SCHOOLS (77%); WRITERS (77%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (76%); CONSUMER LAW (72%); CONSUMER WATCHDOGS (72%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (72%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (72%); CONSUMER PROTECTION (72%); GOVERNORS (71%),"The Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Mariam Aloma Mukhtar, will next Monday, August 18, chair the launch of a book, titled: Corruption and Human Rights Law in Africa.

Parker made the allegation yesterday in Port Harcourt, the state capital. He was reacting to Wike's allegation that Governor Rotimi Amaechi mismanaged the N7.5 billion allocated for the construction of the Karibi-Whyte Specialist Hospital, N3 billion meant for the fumigation of Port Harcourt and N3 billion voted for the city's landscaping. The commissioner said the governor had provided affordable and quality health care for the people and accused Wike, who is believed to be interested in the governorship seat, of fabricating stories to tarnish Amaechi's image. Parker said the minister, who used to be the governor's chief of staff, lacked the moral right to accuse anyone of corruption. He accused Wike of owning property, adding that his earnings do not match his assets. The commissioner said: ""Those who aspire to lead should be mindful of their utterances and actions, especially in this season. If by the time this election cycle is over, our people and institutions have been destroyed, who will they govern? I am ready to stake my character, reputation and integrity against Wike's. Let Rivers people and Nigerians judge. Daily, I remind myself of what the good book says: 'Power belongs to God'. ""I know Wike well. We are both products of the Amaechi political family. Wike may be described as a son of perdition, but he was loved by his family. We have entered another political season, but this should not deter us from speaking the truth. The reality is that power belongs to God and He gives it to who He pleases. ""If in the quest for power, we destroy institutions, malign people and fabricate stories, just to score cheap political points, we fool nobody but ourselves. It is like building a structure on quick sand."" Parker described himself as ""a man of simple taste, with a manageable family size"". He said he had been practising medicine before he ventured into politics, adding that God has blessed him. The commissioner said: ""I know my history. I have no desire for the primitive acquisition of obscene wealth, as I do not indulge in expensive habits, such as the consumption of drinks that cost hundreds of thousands of naira per bottle. When I travel within and outside Nigeria, I am content to do so in commercial airliners. Yet, I feel no envy or jealousy towards those who, even as serving public officers, travel in private jets at least twice a week. I challenge Wike to make same claims. ""Wike has been in public service all of his adult life. There is no record that he has worked anywhere, either as a lawyer or a businessman. I shall give 50 per cent of my August salary to Wike or anybody who can prove that the minister has travelled to Port Harcourt on a commercial flight more than two times since being sworn in as the minister of state for Education. At least, two stubs of flight tickets or manifest that prove that Wike was a passenger on any commercial airline. Who pays for the chartered flights Wike comes to Port Harcourt on, at least two times a week?"" Parker accused Wike of living in an expensive home in Abuja and drinking exotic wines that cost a fortune. The commissioner said it was sad that the minister, ""who claims to be a lawyer"", could not show one brief written by him. He said Wike's familiarity with court rooms was ""as a result of being a plaintiff or defendant"" in law suits. Parker said he was proud to be part of the Amaechi administration since its inception on October 26, 2007, adding: ""Karibi-Whyte Hospital is an on-going project with a target completion date. The first contractor was disengaged based on spurious allegations and campaigns of calumny orchestrated by Wike, then the chief of staff, and his cohorts. ""The governor set up an independent panel of enquiry. The panel exonerated me of any wrongdoing and said the state had lost no money on the project. Not satisfied and blinded by his desire to implicate me in some crime, he pressured the security services and Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) to arrest and indict me. ""The 1,000-bed mega hospital is not an abandoned project and would be inaugurated before long. ""On the Malaria Elimination Programme, Rivers was the first state to embark on malaria elimination. The governor, after consultations with experts in Nigeria, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) decided that malaria elimination was achievable. Malaria has killed more Africans, especially children, than all the World Wars and inter-tribal wars combined. This noble vision was supported by ECOWAS and some foreign governments. ""We commenced the first trial phase of this programme, which involved the spraying of biolarvicide in select local government areas and towns. This was done in conjunction with the Cuban government. The analysis and the effects of the spraying are known to the people, as the findings were made public. Malaria incident reduced by 63 per cent in the areas we sprayed. In fact, it is the effectiveness and efficacy of our trial that led to the National Council on Health adopting malaria elimination as a national health policy for Nigeria. ""Due to the success of this first phase and the high cost of transporting the biolarvicides, the government, to reduce cost, set up a factory to manufacture this essential substance in our Malaria Elimination Programme. The foundation stone for this factory was laid by ECOWAS President Kadre Desire Quedraogo and President Goodluck Jonathan, who was represented by the Minister for Health, Prof. Onyebuchi Chukwu, at the proposed site in Rumuosi, Obio/Akpor Local Government Area, which is Wike's local government. ECOWAS is a partner in this project."" On completion, Parker said the factory would supply biolarvicides to the country and beyond, adding: ""Can Wike claim ignorance of these facts?"""141,The Nation (Nigeria),8/22/2014,"'Corruption, bad leadership slow down Nigeria'",,NIGERIA (98%),,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,22-Aug-14,,330  words,CORRUPTION (90%); ETHNICITY (89%); MANUFACTURING OUTPUT (50%),"The Director-General of the National Orientation Agency (NOA), Mr Mike Omeri, has said corruption and bad leadership are among the major impediments to the nation's development.

The NOA chief spoke yesterday in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, at the second National Development Symposium Series, organised by Oduduwa Youth Development Initiative (OYDI), with the theme: The Nigeria of Yesterday, The Transformation Agenda of Today, The Vision 20-2020 of Tomorrow. He was represented by the agency's Assistant Director, Head of Programmes, Mr Moshood Olaleye. Omeri said: ""Corruption and bad leadership are major challenges to Nigeria's growth. The political or ruling class was more concerned with how it would corner the nation's wealth. In doing this, it drummed up tribal and religious sentiments into the ears of unsuspecting and often gullible citizens as the distraction to cover up its corrupt practices. ""Many of these leaders, who had entrenched themselves in key sectors, lacked discipline, dependability, restraint and patriotism in managing the affairs of the nation. State funds were looted with impunity and stacked away in foreign bank accounts."" According to him, such stolen money was mostly used by the host countries to boost their economies, especially in the Manufacturing sector. Omeri said there was also disregard for the rule of law and the supremacy of the constitution among Nigerians. The NOA chief noted that the laws of the land were violated, adding that attempts to redress them by some citizens and groups were often thwarted through the manipulation of the Judiciary.

They advocated the need for the depoliticisation and internationalisation of war against corruption in line with the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. The lawyers said Olaniyan's 368-paged book, came at a time when the continent's leaders were neck deep in corruption. To them, it was an apt solution to salvage Africa. They noted that anti corruption movement needs certain strengths the human rights law framework has established. For human rights to be realised, it must root out underlying causes of corruption. Answering question on why it took human rights time to address grand corruption, Olaniyan highlighted several key points. He stated the need to attach an appropriate level of moral imperative to war on corruption, noting that: ""It is not just an abstract, victimless crime or tool for political revenge. It is a central cause of human suffering and poverty, and real people are real victims, everyday. The victims are largely neutralised (and virtually anonymous) in the criminal process, with no access to human rights remedies,"" he said. He continued: ""Education, health, development, basic freedom to information, association and life, fair trials and private property rights all languish in the hands of a governance structure laced with corruption. Just as in human rights discourse, the socially and economically vulnerable suffer the most. ""But where can we, the people, the ""victims of corruption"" go for redress? Who will hear our cries for help when we know all too well that our treasuries are being pilfered while public services  from physical infrastructure to fair criminal justice systems and humane, equal treatment of our populacesare routinely denied?"" he queried. Continuing, Olaniyan said as long as instances of grand corruption continue to be treated solely as particular criminal acts of individuals, various immunities will protect wrongdoers from sanctions and the argument of state sovereignty will politicise international efforts at accountability. ""The human rights normative framework, however, has succeeded in limiting otherwise unchecked state power by imposing the duties to protect, respect and fulfill human rights, in effect, realising a concept of public trust. ""The state is entrusted to operate for the benefit and security of the people, not to take what it will from the people's national coffers. Law protects people, not states the power of the state is not absolute and cannot be used as a veil for abuse by its agents, but rather is responsible for their acts,"" he said. Instead of struggling through the inept causation standards in criminal law, Olaniyan suggested that ""the obligations of the state rather than the corrupt acts of its high-ranking officials"" be considered to establish responsibility. ""We could look to a state's acts, or failures to act, in carrying out obligations and commitments under international treaties on corruption and human rights to determine a nexus of breach of diligence and vigilance, corrupt acts of high-ranking officials and alleged human rights violations. This general form of showing causation is more fitting, considering especially the secrecy within which corruption lives,"" he said. Reviewing the book, Abdul Tejan-Cole, a former head of Sierra Leone's Anti-Corruption Commission, called it ""a coming of age story of the anti-corruption movement"". Represented by Jude Ilo, Tejan-Cole described the book as a representation of a scholarship that responds to the urgent governance need in Africa a provocative endeavour that casts a different light on the understanding of corruption and an ingenious expose that elevates corruption to an existential threat to human rights in the continent. ""The ability of the author to weave this compelling narrative is both profound and commendable. Each year, international anti-corruption day precedes human rights day, but in all other ways, the developing struggle against corruption follows the path laid by the human rights movement. ""Anti corruption efforts would be best progressed by relying not only on the shoulders of national criminal law systems, but also thorough recognition by and integration into global and regional human rights law, norms and practice. ""The 368-paged book painstakingly considers the many faceted perspectives of this proposition from a review of existing treatment of grand corruption schemes in domestic criminal law settings to a look at the wide-ranging scope of human rights protected by the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and other international treaties impacted or violated by corruption, to the theoretical bases for applying the normative human rights framework to a problem, which has proven too vast to handle through criminal law alone, results in a reference point for lawyers, judges, elected leaders and civil society alike to take the movement forward. ""The application of this framework to grand corruption is clear, as is Olaniyan's clear advice that sticking with a strict adherence to traditional norms of state and sovereign immunity of national criminal law systems will always keep us from touching the lifeblood of corruption,"" he said. According to Tejan-Cole, there should be a derivative proceeding such as practised in corporate shareholders' actions that would allow members of the public to bring in recovery of stolen assets. He said though civil society's experience in initiating and supporting anti corruption proceedings elucidate other complications in getting to accountability, there is still more work to be done in showcasing the damage corruption does to human rights. ""Recent and unfolding experience in international asset recovery and repatriation schemes also reveal a host of thorny issues that will likely require significant time to develop into norms, which respect not only peoples' rights to wealth and development, but also democratic values of governance and decision-making by a truly representative mechanism, lest we devolve into battles between peoples' within a state and between the people and the state. ""In practice, finding answers to some of these questions will be difficult. Although relating corruption to human rights will enable governments and spirited public citizens to use human rights mechanisms to address the problem of corruption, making corruption a human rights issue will not necessarily on its own ensure that it is eliminated. ""The author acknowledges the limitation of this approach and rightly opines that human rights approach to corruption should only be a part of multi-tiered engagements that should incorporate all other mechanisms for fighting corruption. ""He outlines a multiplicity of strategies for addressing corruption in the region.It is clear, though, that a one-size-fits-all response to corruption cannot satisfactorily or effectively address the problem, especially given its complexities, multidisciplinary and contemporary nature (and the fact that its causes vary widely), and its varying, but devastating effects on human rights in regions like Africa.

Speaking during a plenary session of the ongoing Annual General Conference of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) in Owerri, Imo State, Obi, who spoke on the topic: ""Nigeria, Any Hope For industrial Revolution,"" said corruption does more than harm development. ""Corruption and greed kill entrepreneurship, hardwork and professionalism,"" he said.

""Someone is voted into office and had no house, no car, but in six months, the person has three cars, six houses, and the person organises a thanksgiving. Even the bishop is praying for him to make more money. ""We have to start fighting those things that make industrial revolution impossible. We have to start by building a country where there is zero tolerance for greed and impunity,"" Obi said. Meanwhile, the NBA President, Okey Wali (SAN), has called for a reform of appointment and elevation of judges and justices. He said nothing in law stops a qualified lawyer from being appointed a state's Chief Judge, adding that a lawyer should also be able to go to the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court from the Bar without having to serve on the bench first. Wali also sought a review of the Constitution to divest governors of powers to appoint Chief Judges. He said, ""Why should another arm of government appoint the head of another arm? Does the judiciary appoint the governor of a state? Do we appoint the speaker of the House of Assembly? So why should they appoint our head?""

On corruption, NBA called for a reinvigoration of the criminal justice system as a panacea for dealing with criminality. There's the dire need for the Federal Government to re-engineer and re-invigorate all the anti-corruption agencies as well as grant them more autonomy. This is to ensure their impartiality and for them to exercise their powers and perform their functions without fear, favour or prejudice and without interference from any person or organ of state,"" NBA said. To further discourage corrupt practices, the lawyers' body urged judges to impose the maximum sentences provided in law rather than a mere ""slap on the wrist"" for those found guilty of graft. Judges should be equitable and balanced in the administration of criminal justice in such a way that punishment is blind to status and class. Cases involving serious crime should be assigned to very experienced judges in order to ensure that not so experienced judges do not tacitly encourage such crimes through faulty determination of such matters. The imposition of fine alone is inappropriate for serious crimes. Punishment should combine both fine and imprisonment to reflect the societal revulsion of such serious crimes. The Federal Government, through all stakeholders in the administration of criminal justice should establish a national crime data bank in order to keep information on fingerprints, identification and criminal records of every offender,"" NBA said."146,The Nation (Nigeria),9/16/2014,Disquiet in Onitsha council over alleged corruption,,NIGERIA (96%),,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,16-Sep-14,,254  words,REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (92%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); CORRUPTION (90%),"There was disquiet yesterday in Onitsha South Local Government Area of Anambra State when some members of the legislative arm accused their leader, Mr. Fredrick Ezenwa, of ineptitude, impunity, corruption and undemocratic practices.

Abaribe said the most unfortunate thing in the deliberate diatribe against the National Assembly, was ex-President Obasanjo's allegation that the lawmakers are siphoning public funds through what they call constituency projects.'"" The allegation, according to Abaribe was spurious as it were because it is very distant from the truth and is nowhere near reality. He added that if it were so, the former President would not have tolerated such for the period he was the President of the country. Abaribe said: Ex- President Obasanjo for the avoidance of doubt, was the initiator of the constituency project in the year 2000 as a means of ensuring that projects were fairly spread across the country using the Senatorial zones as the spring board. To ensure execution of the projects, Obasanjo again factored the constituency projects into the annual budgets to be implemented by the executive depending on availability of funds. That is to say that no lawmaker ever comes close to the funds or even determine the contractor for the said projects or when the said contract would be awarded. So, it looks curious and surprising that former President Obasanjo would turn around after over 10 years of initiating such a project to allege that the National Assembly is performing the function of both the executive and the parliament. Is it not preposterous for anybody to believe that members of the National Assembly would against the provisions of the Constitution with regards to application of separation of powers, award contracts to their agents to execute' and expect the Presidency under a President Obasanjo or any other President for that matter to pay for what they are not part of? Such allegation stands logic on its head, as it amounts to an indictment of the Presidency for wilfully contravening the budget laws by ceding its power to execute to the National Assembly, if it was the case."" The Senate, according to the statement, challenged the former President to go a step further to furnish Nigerians with details of how the National Assembly members became executors of national budget rather than being law makers. Abaribe said: It will also help to clear the allegation once and for all, if any Presidency official not only from the time past but currently, could come forward and explain the true position of the so called constituency projects. Doing so would at least set the records straight.""

The TI had rated Nigeria 136th, against the 2013 rating of 144th. According to a statement by Okupe, the ""improvement"" in the rating has demonstrated that the President has remained focused in his determination to completely eradicate corruption in public service. The statement said: ""The latest TI rating is a proof that President Jonathan's effort in the fight against corruption is yielding positive results. There is no doubt that since President Jonathan came on board as president of this country, the fight against corruption has been taken several notches higher. ""Unlike any previous administration in the country's history, the present administration has instituted institutional reforms aimed at giving fillip to the anti-corruption war. ""One major area this fight has been visible is the agricultural sector where the administration's carefully articulated and executed Agricultural Transformation Agenda (ATA) ended forty years of corruption in the distribution of fertilizers to farmers. ""The same thing applies to the reforms in the Ports where we have successfully plugged many loopholes which some corrupt officials had exploited to delay genuine business transactions and harm the Nigerian economy. ""The old corrupt system of Government Direct Procurement and Distribution of Fertiliser as well as the operations in the various Ports and government agencies contributed in no small measure to the negative rating of Nigeria by the Transparency International and other global watchdogs. ""Also, the determination of President Jonathan to tackle corruption head on has seen the government take some other far reaching steps like the cleaning up of the import waiver system, which before his coming was fraught with corruption, nepotism, arbitrariness and other irregularities. As a result of this, billions of Naira were lost to the economy as the real business people failed to benefit"". Okupe added that while it is important for suspects involved in corruption cases to be tried and if found guilty sent to jail, what is more important to the administration is for the development of mechanisms, the institution of structures and the enactment of policies that would plug loopholes and foster transparency such that the propensity for corruption is made more difficult and eliminated completely. The President's aide maintained that the administration has adopted the template employed by least corrupt countries like Denmark and New Zealand, through the use of information and communications technology to tackle corruption head on. He continued: ""Key reforms instituted by the administration like the electronic payment system and the IPPS system have helped reduced corruption in the system. ""Of particular importance is the fact that through these institutional reforms, the Federal Government has been able to weed out as many as 50,000 ghost workers and saved the country billions of naira in the process.

Justice Akanbi, who is a former president of the Appeal Court said: ""The indices are that the moments are dark, the clouds have thickened and corruption is escalating. And we cannot pretend. The Transparency International put us at the position of 136th corrupt nation you cannot deny it even though it is a perception. Honestly, I do not see what is being done about corruption now. ""Speaking for myself, I ask myself this question: Does it mean all the governors are corrupt-free? Does it mean all the legislators are corruption-free? Does it mean the judiciary is corruption free? We know what it is happening but people are not being arrested, no action is being taken and the end result is that people accept bribe with impunity now. ""At least if they had taken few people to court, we would have known that something is being done. There is a general lull and the fight against corruption has gone down completely. That is why we are gearing up the tempo now so that people can be aware of it. ""Now when you look at many people wanting to be governors, is it because they want to serve their people or that they want to go and chop, chop chop? It is apparent that many of them want to enrich themselves because they know that when you go there you make money and become wealthy ditto going to the legislature. Yet people are suffering, there is no development. Corruption, kidnapping and the ills of the society have gone on the ascendency."" Mallam Ali said the President's actions, utterances and body language suggest that corruption does not exist in Nigeria. The Ilorin based legal practitioner added: ""I have said this long time, no drive against corruption by the current government and that is quite obvious because the President believes that there is no corruption in Nigeria. ""He believes that what is going on is petty stealing. So if he doesn't believe there is corruption, you can't hold him for not driving any anti- corruption war. If somebody doesn't believe there is a problem then he would not be obliged to look for solution."""158,The Nation (Nigeria),1/5/2015,"Corruption now worse than before, says Babangida",,NIGERIA (94%),,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,5-Jan-15,"ABUJA, NIGERIA (79%)",1329  words,CORRUPTION (91%); INTERVIEWS (90%); MILITARY RULE (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); FINANCIAL CRIME COUNTERMEASURES (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); TRANSCRIPTS (70%),"Former Military President Ibrahim Babangida has faulted the perception that he is corrupt. He challenged anybody with proof of corruption during his 1985  1993 regime to come forward with them. Gen. Babangida said members of his government are angels compared with what he is reading in the newspapers about what is going on now. He requested any Nigerian with a shred of corruption against him to release the facts to the public. The former military president said the $12.4b Gulf Oil War windfall of 1991 was not stolen. Gen. Babangida made the clarifications in an interview with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission's press crew for the agency's in-house magazine, ""Zero tolerance."" The EFCC released the transcript of the interview to reporters in Abuja yesterday. He said: ""Let me tell you something, maybe you have a hand in it. I have been the most investigated President Nigeria has ever had. By now, somebody should have come forward to say here it is. ""Every government that came after me investigated me because of that perception as they wanted to retrieve the billions I stole."" He said he and those who served in his administration were saints and angels going by the level of corruption in the country. ""Well, we had different approaches. I think my government was able to identify corruption-prone areas and checked them. If you remember in this country, there were things they call essential commodities. These are also sources of corruption. You go and buy Omo or food or whatever it is and we got government to take its hands off such activities. Let people use their own brains, hands and labour, nobody has to do it for them. So we did but I am proud to say that was much more effective. ""I don't have the facts but if what I read in the newspapers is currently what is happening then I think we were angels On the allegation that his military regime institutionalized corruption in Nigeria, Gen. Babangida said though he had been aware of such insinuation, the assumption is incorrect. He added: ""Yeah, I know. Maybe I have to accept that but anybody with a sense of fairness has no option but to call us saints. I give you an example, in a year I was making less than $7billion in oil revenue. In the same period, there are governments that are making $200billion to $300billion. ""With $7billion, I did the little I could achieve. With $200billion, there is still a lot to be achieved."" The ex-President said being branded as corrupt was a question of perception. He said: ""It is said that perception is not reality. Why the perception? I should ask you because it is the perception of the media. You believed quite wrongly that we are all crooks and I bear no grudge whatsoever against anybody but I know time will come when they will say after all, they did something and this is what is happening. ""Now, even our fiercest critics give us credit for certain things we did."" Pressed further on his investments, Babangida admitted owning shares in a bank. The interaction is as follows: What are these investments? I would assure you, using my head, I came to the conclusion that the best investment for someone like me is banking. That's all. You have shares in banks? How many banks? No, in one bank. A major shareholder, sir? Yes Which bank are we talking of? (Cuts in)Again investigatelaughs. On how he built his Hilltop Mansion in Minna, Babangida said: ""I cannot estimate because it has appreciated. I know what my friends spent. No, my friends contributed. ""They were friends before we came into government and friends while I was in government. ""I started building it in 1991, took two to three years so that by the time I finished, I would have a house to sleep in."" Concerning the $12.4billion oil windfall from the 1991 Gulf War, Babangida insisted the money was not stolen. ""First of all, that war lasted three months, about ninety something days. It didn't last up to a year. So get the facts straight. ""Secondly, the oil price at that time was below $18 per barrel. So, there is no way you could make $12.4billion in three months. ""We could not have made that amount of money but Pius Okigbo knew what he was doing. He had brains and he said between 1986 or 1988 to 1994, monies accrued to the Federal Government at that time was about that money you are calling windfall. He said so. It is there in his book. ""Then the other thing he said, the monies could have gone into generative investment. I am not an economist but I have an understanding of what this is. ""Our argument then was if you have the money, why keep it and be looking at it when you have a lot of things that will benefit the ordinary man. So that money was not stolen. ""It is what you see now in the country. Thank God most of the infrastructure we put in place are what you are using today and proudly so."" Asked to identify the infrastructure, Gen. Babangida said: ""Abuja for example, I built Abuja. Today, we have a brand new capital. We used that money. ""I gave you a Third Mainland Bridge in Lagos. You cannot build it now for all the money Nigeria is making. And what did it cost me? N500million, N600million, N700million. ""For the first time, a dual carriage way was seen in the Northern part of the country between Kaduna and Kano and then linked it up from Abuja. You cannot afford to do it now you cannot even afford to touch it because there are a lot of competing needs."" Despite the annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential election, he admitted that the poll was the most credible in the history of Nigeria. He also opened up on why a former Minister of FCT, Gen. Mamman Vatsa was killed after his involvement in the 1995 coup d'etat. He said his hands were tied by military law which was inevitably applied by his regime. The annulled poll was won by the late business mogul, Chief M.K.O. Abiola, who later died in detention while struggling to reclaim his mandate. abangida said: ""Yes, it (June 12) is a day in the history of Nigeria and the day the most credible election was held ""We gave you a lot of reasons but I understood the passion. At that time, everybody was fed up. The sentiment was: just pack your things and go. Our thought process is very limited. ""First of all, on June 23, 1993, I was on the air and I told Nigerians why we had to do what we did but I was sensible enough to know that whatever I said nobody was interested. So, the important thing is get out."" He admitted that the annulment was supported by some Nigerians and pro-June 12 activists. He added: ""I hate to say it but when we annulled June 12 poll, the same Nigerians supported the intervention of the military, true or false? ""True because you saw it, you are old enough. All those who fought for June 12 ended up serving the military government they didn't like and that perpetuated a longer stay of the military in government."" Asked why he used the phrase 'step aside' to leave power in 1993, Babangida said it was a military parlance. ""Everyone of you though that I was not keeping pace with the Nigerian dream. We have a tradition in the military. If you are marching in a column, when they say left, you should obey the command. If you right foot, somebody will shout at you because you are affecting the column, you should step aside so that the column will continue. That was what I did."" On why Gen. Mamman Vatsa was killed, Gen. Babangida said he was hamstrung by the law. He added: ""Because others before him faced the same law, the only change in that law was introduced by us to give room for appeal. ""If I was involved in that coup and it flopped, I would have been shot too. So it is the application of the law but then it is painful. ""We made the law, others suffered the consequences."" Responding to a question, Babangida said the military indulged in coup d'etat each time there was frustration in the society. He however described military interregnum as a phase that the country was going through at that time."159,The Nation (Nigeria),1/17/2015,"Nigerians are right on corruption, Mr President",,NIGERIA (94%),,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,18-Jan-15,,441  words,CORRUPTION (91%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (90%); LARCENY & THEFT (90%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (89%); EMBEZZLEMENT (78%); EDUCATION ADMINISTRATION (78%); BRIBERY (78%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (77%); FINANCIAL CRIME COUNTERMEASURES (68%); GOVERNORS (64%),"I grew up learning from my parents and teachers that stealing has no degrees. In other words, a man who steals N100 is guilty of theft as much as another who steals a million naira. My father, a teacher and school administrator before he became a traditional ruler, would even add that you become a thief the moment you contemplate stealing. Repeatedly, he told us that stealing and covetousness are siblings and their mother is greed. I have lived within the bounds of my father's stipulation for more than four decades, contenting myself only with things I can acquire legitimately and studiously avoiding greed. Mercifully, I never had the misfortune of coming under the influence of anyone with a contrary view of theft. My soul has, therefore, been sorely troubled since President Goodluck Jonathan launched a campaign that seems to eulogise stealing and lionize theft which, to him, must not be rated as evil as corruption and consequently not punishable. ""Over 70 per cent of what is called corruption, even by the EFCC (Economic and Financial Crimes Commission) and other anti-corruption agencies, is not corruption, but common stealing,"" the President said on national television on May 5 last year. He has since followed that up by declaring that Nigerians have a flawed perception of corruption because they often equate financial breakthrough with it. At a recent political rally in Enugu, the President, who is known to have defended some members of his cabinet accused of corrupt practices, reportedly criticized the military administration led by Gen Muhammadu Buhari between 1983 and 1985 for sending a former governor of Anambra State, Chief Jim Nwobodo, to jail just because the latter stole a sum that could not even buy a new car. The President thus unwittingly provoked a debate as to which is more edifying between theft and corruption. A dictionary defines corruption as impairment of integrity, virtue or moral principle. Its synonyms include debauchery, debasement and decadence. It defines stealing or theft, on the other hand, as the act of taking or carrying away (something) without right or permission. Its synonyms are robbery, larceny and rip-off. Under the ICPC Act 2000, theft or embezzlement of public funds is included among corrupt acts. What then is the point being made by the President? That he would rather accommodate a thief than tolerate a corrupt individual? It may interest him to know that whereas bribery was the pivot on which corruption rotated, its new garb is theft or what the President calls common stealing"160,The Nation (Nigeria),1/29/2015,Corruption: Will 2015 elections bring respite?,,NIGERIA (93%),,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,28-Jan-15,,437  words,ELECTIONS (91%); POLITICAL PARTIES (90%); ELECTION AUTHORITIES (90%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (90%); VOTERS & VOTING (90%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (90%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (89%); POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS (78%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (78%); ELECTION LAW (78%); CORRUPTION (76%); POLITICS (73%),"The Coalition of Democrats for Electoral Reforms (CODER) yesterday urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to reject the call for the postponement of the general elections.

In a statement he issued in Lagos, Opadokun accused those calling for polls' shift because of the PVCs controversy of having a hidden agenda, urging the electoral body to ignore them. He said: ""Given the analysis of Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) collection on regional exercise, INEC and the electorate certainly need to demonstrate greater resolve to ensure that all registered voters are able to collect their PVC without further frustration. ""The marked wide difference between 80 per cent and 40 per cent respectively in the average collection rates in the Northern and Southern states indicate strongly that the INEC, the political parties and the non-government organisations whose thrust is about credible elections must provide more intensive advocacy about the significance of the gPVCs."" Opadokun alleged that INEC deliberately created the current logjam because it ignored the advice to test-run the recently acquired Card Readers in Ekiti and Osun governorship elections. He lamented that the commission responded by saying that g""the Card Readers will not be used because the elections in those two states will be keenly contested."" gHe added: ""The current gINEC announcement that voters who have not been able to collect their PVC should go and collect them in their respective Local Governments and registration centres have not significantly improve the number of PVC that have been collected. INEC had about four years to have prepared a seamless exercise for the production and distribution of PVC. ""The revelation from the Sultan of Sokoto that he has not been able to collect his own personal voter's card is a significant illustration of the level of agony that voters are going through. Some have revealed to gCODER as to how they have visited registration centres and in their respective Local Government areas where they reside and were unable to collect the PVC due to a number of incidences e.g Names not found in the register even though they presented their Temporary Voter Cards (TVCs).

The growing cases of corruption in Nigeria can also be traced to people holding one post or the other in the private sector. It is no longer news that Nigeria ranked 136thin the 2014 Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, which measured the perceived levels of public sector corruption in 175 countries and territories. The position placed Nigeria as the third most corrupt country in West Africa after Guinea and Guinea Bissau. Corruption in our country will continue to strive in spite of anti-corruption laws, because those who perpetrate the corrupt practices get away with the crime, such that there's no fear for any consequences. A man in power is confident that no action will be taken against him and he will get away with the crime. We have seen how anti-graft laws are being applied especially in the Economic and Financial Crimes commission, EFCC. The Commission is limited in prosecuting corrupt leaders due to the so-called immunity clause which makes our leaders free of scrutiny and investigation. For the war against corruption to be won, law enforcement agencies should be given teeth to bite. Nigeria is currently in an election period, which will either see to the end of an era, or the birth of another. It behoves on us to ask ourselves: ""will the new regime tighten the noose around corrupt individuals in the country or will it pay lip-service to the war on corruption?"" Nigerians are fed up with the failed promises by our leaders. It has dawned on us that the current system doesn't encourage honesty and hardwork. The greed amongst our leaders to acquire wealth despite the plight faced by our people is appalling. Politics has become big business whatever is spent to attain a political post is seen as an investment to be recovered once the politician gets into power. These rogues are glorified and celebrated to the extent that uniforms (aso-ebi) are worn to celebrate them. The time has come to strictly enforce anti-corruption laws without fear, by making examples of a select few to deter others from committing economic and financial crimes. To effectively battle corruption, we must begin from the grassroots. The mass media has an important role to play in the war against corruption. In this election year, there is a need to educate the public of their rights as citizens of this great nation. If our rights are respected, we will have a secured nation. The media should also report the truth and not report diluted news to the public. If Nigeria is to be rid of corruption, there should be a thirst for contentment among us all. It is pertinent that we open our eyes and see the damages of corruption to our nation. It has and will continue to bring misery to our countrymen if we do not rise as one and destroy this scourge called corruption. We pray and hope that this year will bring a new dawn in Nigeria.

Remember him? Aikhomu was the gruff mariner who, as Chief of General Staff, ranked second in the regime of military president Ibrahim Babangida, appointed to replace the strong-willed Ebitu Ukiwe. Never so happy as when confounding opponents and confusing friends, Babangida woke up one day and announced that, in keeping with the Constitution of the Federal Republic, Aikhomu had become civilian vice president under the military regime. Apparently also in keeping with the Constitution that Babangida was operating a loose-leaf document, the pages of which he shuffled endlessly, he announced several months later that the former naval chief turned civilian, had been promoted to the rank of Admiral. Aikhomu had no patience with all the fancy footwork that was the preoccupation of his principal. Irascible and, withal, blunt as a cudgel, he told it exactly as he saw it. He was a reporter's delight, always forthcoming with delicious quotes. One day, reporters assembled for his customary Friday afternoon news conference, asked for his reaction to yet another damning report on the Nigerian economy that the IMF/World Bank had just issued. ""What report?"" he snickered. ""Do you know that those so-called reports are written by small boys like yourselves?"" ack then, the dominant issue in public discourse was ""misappropriation"" of public funds. For the most part, when people talked at all about ""corruption"" in public office, they did so only in whispers, checkmated by Decree 2, under which the government vested itself with the power to detain anyone for as long as it pleased, without judicial review. And Aikhomu was the decree's chief administering officer. ut Aikhomu saw through the subterfuge. From ""misappropriation"" of public funds, it was but a short step to ""embezzlement"" of the same. So, he re-framed the discourse, such as it was. The problem, he said, was not so much misappropriation as misallocation of public funds. Unfortunately, weighed down by state duties and the twists and turns and the labyrinthine trajectory of his principal's duplicitous political transition programme  in which he dutifully acquiesced, by the way Aikhomu did not have the time to work out with lexical finality the difference between ""misappropriation"" and ""misallocation"" of public funds. ut from what I could make of it, misappropriation, with its undertone of embezzlement or plain theft  ""original stealing"" as the immortal Afrobeat king Fela Anikulapo Kuti called itwas the cardinal sin. Misallocation of public funds was not worth all the blather. In practical terms  and here I am second-guessing the mariner  if a public official used funds earmarked for a hospital to build himself a country home with a swimming pool and a helipad, he had merely misallocated the funds, and did not deserve the kind of condemnation to which an official who misappropriated such funds deserved to be subjected. It might even be argued that if the official moved such funds into his private bank account, it would still have been a mere mislocation  putting the funds away in the in the wrong place  rather than a misappropriation. And here we are, more than two decades later and no wiser until the eminent scientist and respected taxonomist in him moved Dr Goodluck Jonathan to take time off his demanding re-election schedule to clear up the semantic mess and complete Aikhomu's unfinished work. And he has gone about the difficult task with the fine sense of discrimination that only a world-class ichthyologist can call up at short notice and amidst the kind of distraction that only a few in his exalted league can even begin to imagine. In the popular understanding, and even in the minds of the lexicographers, corruption consists basically in dishonest acts. The Explanatory Memorandum to the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act 2000 says rather laconically that ""corruption"" includes bribery, fraud, and other related offences. ut the body of that law goes on to define corruption to the point of saturation. Corruption is in play, it says, when a public official asks for, receives or obtains property or benefits of any kind for himself or others, agrees or attempts to receive such rewards for himself or others, for benefits or favours already granted or expected to be granted. And so on and so forth. Conviction carries a seven-year jail term. That is the law of the land. That is the law appointees of the Jonathan administration have been administering, with funds approved by the National Assembly. That is the law under which the Independent Corrupted Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has prosecuted and sent to jail, by its own count, thousands of wayward public officials. ut the ICPC and its agents, we now know, have been labouring not just under a misapprehension, but, under a delusion to boot. For, as Dr Jonathan has been saying, in statements heard around the world, the things people call ""corruption"" in Nigeria fall far short of the threshold. Those who are forever beating the government on the head with allegations of overarching corruption would be closer to the mark if they talked instead about stealing. I hope they are listening, all those do-gooders who compile the International Corruption Index and the so-called foreign donors. In whatever case, the amounts usually cited as evidence of corrupt dealings are piddling. One official creams off, say, N5 billion in pension funds and they rush to cite that it as evidence of corruption. Easy, gentlemen. This is not Burkina Faso. We are talking about the largest economy on the entire African continent, and the 16th largest and one of the fastest-growing in the whole wide world. From Dr Jonathan's seminal submission, it would seem follow that the law under which ICPC has been prosecuting and jailing innocent persons is misconceived, at least insofar as it presumes to act on a matter in which its jurisdiction is dubious at best, and to the extent that it has been punishing acts it misconstrues as corrupt when it should have been punishing ordinary stealing. That kind of enactment has no place under Nigeria's legal system  a system undergirded by the rule of law, of which Dr Jonathan himself is the foremost apostle. It has done too much harm already. Dr Jonathan should act with his accustomed dispatch and move the National Assembly to void the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act of 2000 and its instrumentalities, going back to the day he took office. It is time to end the costly and damaging misperception that corruption rather than ordinary stealing is Nigeria's problem."163,The Nation (Nigeria),3/22/2015,We are over celebrating corruption Jonathan,,NIGERIA (94%),,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,22-Mar-15,"LAGOS, NIGERIA (72%)",233  words,CORRUPTION (91%); HEALTH CARE (73%); HOTELS & MOTELS (72%); FERTILIZERS (57%); ELECTRONIC COMMERCE (57%),"President Goodluck Jonathan on Sunday night maintained that his administration has done well in the fight against corruption in last four years.

Saraki noted that asset declaration is an accepted protocol of statutory disclosure. But, the former governor said that alone could not reduce corruption. The senator representing Kwara Central, in a statement by his media aide, Bamikole Omishore, said: ""Corruption has been one of the greatest challenges we face as a country in years past and all efforts, both personal commitment and systemic arrangements should be put in place to further cage this endemic in our society."" He called on all politicians as a matter of national importance to emulate the leadership of President-elect Muhammadu Buhari by declaring their asset and ""also committing to transparency and accountability in every aspect of our lives as a nation so as to restore confidence of the citizenry in government"".

Mr Mabadeje said: ''The administration of Governor Babatunde Raji Fashola has invested in e-governance through the automation and re-engineering of government business processes, as well as implementing and deploying a Citizens Relationship Management system which delivers efficient services to the citizens more transparently.'' The commissioner disclosed that partnership with reputable original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and world-class systems integrators had enabled the state to deliver e-governance solutions with Autoreg, e-learning systems, e-health, e-C of O, EDMS and Cloud Technology, among others. He said that the collaboration with the private sector had enhanced the ease of deployment of broadband infrastructure and penetration in the state, thereby making the state the hub of the nation's internet connectivity. The commissioner also identified some of the major projects and initiatives of the ministry to include implementation of disaster recovery sites, migration of solutions to the cloud, video conferencing solutions in some key government offices, ICT labs and libraries in schools, migration of solutions to the Cloud, as well as upgrading the Alausa Fibre Optic Backbone network. The General Manager of the Lagos State Residents Registration Agency, Ms Yinka Fashola, had, on the occasion, cleared the air on the apparent lull in the activity of the agency, noting that the security implication of the challenges faced by the Independent National Election Commission (INEC) in distributing the Permanent Voter Cards for the 2015 elections informed the apparent slow down in the activities of the agency'' Ms Fashola, who dispelled insinuations that the agency recently sacked some workers, noted that only contract staff whose terms of engagement had expired were affected. She disclosed that over three million residents have been registered by the agency under the programme. The commissioner had earlier said that the ministry also organizes yearly science and technology camps to promote Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in the state's schools, in addition to the ongoing Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement to develop a world-class forensic laboratory in the state. Throwing more light on the STEM initiative, Mr Mabadeje said the purpose was to deepen the understanding of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics subjects in primary and secondary schools and get the pupils interested in those subjects from an early age to enhance their proficiency in the higher education and in adult life."168,The Nation (Nigeria),4/29/2015,"Buhari seeks NASS support on corruption, restructuring",,NIGERIA (94%); NIGER (79%); AFRICA (79%),,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,29-Apr-15,"ABUJA, NIGERIA (92%)",505  words,LEGISLATIVE BODIES (92%); CORRUPTION (90%); BUDGETS (89%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (74%); SMALL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE (73%); UNEMPLOYED PERSONS (73%); OIL & GAS PRICES (70%); UNEMPLOYMENT RATES (65%); INFRASTRUCTURE (64%); REBELLIONS & INSURGENCIES (64%); ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES (50%),"President-elect, Gen.

On a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 the most corrupt and 10 the most transparent, TI rated Angola 1,8 and Zimbabwe 2,3, some of the highest corruption ratings in the world.

A relative explained how the government illicitly collected revenue: ""Mobutu would ask one of us to go to the bank and take out US$1 million. We'd go to an intermediary and tell him to get US$5 million. He would go to the bank with Mobutu's authority, and take out US$10 million. Mobutu got one, and we took the other nine.ŒæMobutu allegedly stole up to US$4 billion to US$5 billion while in office.""During Malawi's Hastings Banda's rule, 1961 to 1994, the press and radio were tightly controlled and mainly served as outlets for government propaganda.Television was banned. Knowledge of pre-Banda history was discouraged, and many books on these subjects were burned. It is believed that during his rule, Banda accumulated at least US$320 million in personal assets, thought to be invested in everything from agriculture to mining interests in South Africa.Zimbabwe may have the largest diamond fields, but in most areas there is no clean water, and about 67% of the people live below the poverty datum line. Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe for nearly three decades and has led it, in that time, from impressive success to the most dramatic peacetime collapse. The same Zanu PF elite who acquired multiple farms as a result of the land redistribution, are the same people who are manipulating and benefitting from the backdoor-crafted Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act.Josí© Eduardo dos Santos was elected as President of the MPLA (People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola) on 20 September 1979, and he took office as President of Angola, President of the MPLA, and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces on September 21. He was also elected as President of the People's Assembly on November 9 1980.Dos Santos married three times and has six children from his wives, and one born out of wedlock.ŒæHe and his family have amassed a significant personal fortune.The actual value is unknown, but in recent years his daughterŒæIsabel dos Santos who manages the family fortune, has made multi-million dollar investments in Angola and in Portugal, in her name and that of her husband.

BY PATRICE MAKOVA Zacc chairperson, Denford Chirindo said following remarks by President Robert Mugabe last week castigating corrupt public officials, investigations of all people linked to corruption were now in full throttle.He said Zacc was investigating several cases of prominent people implicated in corruption, including the alleged US$6 million bribe scandal at a State-owned, Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC).Mugabe last week alleged that former ZMDC chairman, Godwills MasimirembwaŒædemanded and received a US$6 million bribe from William Ato EssienŒæ of Ghana, who wanted to invest in the country's diamond sector.Chirindo refused to disclose the other bigwigs Zacc was investigating, arguing this could alert the culprits with the possibility that some could run away.But the anti-graft boss said Mugabe's calls were a direct order and clarion call to all law enforcement agencies to co-operate and swing into action with renewed vigour, in order to stop corrupt people in their tracks.""We are geared to move forward,"" Chirindo said. ""What other order do you want? It cannot be negotiated. The President's directive has to be executed to the letter, otherwise the whip will be cracked on our backs.""A few months ago Zacc commissioners and investigators said they feared for their lives after attempting to investigate high-level corruption in government.This came in the wake of a clampdown on Zacc after the anti-graft body's efforts to investigate corruption allegations against the ZMDC, three Zanu PF cabinet ministers and the National Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Board was blocked.But Chirindo said the public spat was now a thing of the past, adding Zacc commissioners and investigators had no reason to fear doing their jobs.""The President said it loud and clear that corruption must go. What other protection do they want?""All citizens must take heed. People must not be afraid as it is the duty of each and every individual to fight corruption.""He said Mugabe's messages also proved there was 100% political will in the fight against corruption.Chirindo however appealed to parliamentarians to ensure that Zacc received adequate funding to enable the body to effectively executive its mandate.""We hope they [MPs] will support us because even they are not sacred cows,"" he said.In the past, Zacc confirmed that it was investigating Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor Gideon Gono, former Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai and Local Government, Rural and Urban Development minister, Ignatius Chombo, among others.But analysts said the government's commitment and sincerity to the fight against corruption would have to pass the test of time.Political analyst, Thabani Nyoni saidŒæit was surprising that Mugabe was now calling for action, yet he recently claimed calls to audit the lifestyles of rich cabinet ministers and the arrest of corrupt public officials were difficult to implement.""Mugabe's response was that people should bring evidence,"" he said. ""But it is not the duty of whistle-blowers to provide such evidence. Zacc should be allowed to do its job. The last time they tried to do that, there were lots of threats and persecutions.""Nyoni, who is also the Bulawayo Agenda executive director and Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition (CiZC) spokesperson, said it was unlikely that the country would see the naming and shaming of bigwigs involved in corruption.He sees only the small fish being targeted.Nyoni said Zanu PF survived on a system of patronage, which itself thrived on corruption by rewarding loyalists.""This anti-corruption drive is a window dressing. If it is to go full throttle, it will take the entire Zanu PF leadership,"" said Nyoni.Last year, Mugabe confirmed that some of his ministers were corrupt to the core, demanding bribes of up to US$10 million from potential foreign investors.However, no action has been taken against the suspects. 'lack of political will will hamper investigations' Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum executive director, Abel Chikomo said the major constraint in the anti-graft crusade was lack of political will and obsession of pursuing the small fish.He said as long as the ""big guys"" who were involved in serious corruption remained untouchable, the anti-corruption drive would not go far.""The fish rots from the head. Corruption is so cancerous that it affects the whole cross section of society. If we treat the symptoms and not the disease itself, then we are not going anywhere,"" said Chikomo.On the case of Masimirembwa, he said the tenets of rule of law stipulated that an individual was presumed innocent until proven guilty by a competent court of law. Chikomo said another constraint in the anti-graft fight was corruption in the judiciary.""Real big guys can buy their freedom.

One of the politicians was later indicted for corruption and is now serving a 13-year jail sentence. Years later we returned to the country and we are building our presence in that wonderful country again.In another country, we submitted a tender on privatisation and we were recommended as the best by the international investment bankers advising the government of that country.

The son of the President asked for a 20% stake in exchange for us being given the award. I refused and withdrew our bid. I have no regrets.When the President had lost an election, we returned to that country and got an opportunity to set up and we are doing very well.In yet another country, a retiring African President invited me to come and see him. He told me he had heard a lot of good things about our company. He said he wanted to issue one more licence before he left office and he felt that we should have it because we were an African company. He then suggested that I find a way to accommodate him quietly off shore, as he ""needed something in retirement"". I politely told him that I was not interested in the licence. We are yet to return to that country, but we will one day.In one of Africa's most respected countries, a policeman asked me for my driver's licence as I drove to church one morning with my family.I told him that I had forgotten it at home. He said that I had committed an offence, which I immediately accepted. Instead of giving me a ticket, he suggested that I pay him something.I refused. He then threatened to arrest me and I said it was fine and he could go ahead. Several of his colleagues surrounded us, even verbally abusing me saying I would be deported because I was a foreigner.I kept quiet. I never raised my voice, or was animated. I simply asked that they either arrest me, or issue me a ticket. After a while they said we could go. I refused and insisted they ticket me as they had an obligation to do so under the law.

The creation of the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc) in 2011 was welcomed by citizens who hoped that the watchdog would curb graft, especially in the public offices.   But the organisation is being hamstrung by lack of political will which has resulted in bigwigs fingered in corruption going scot free. Transparency International Zimbabwe (TI-Z) director, Mary-Jane Ncube said the corruption indicators showed that the country was not improving in terms of curbing corruption.   She said cases of bribery involving public officials and illicit financial flows were prevalent in the country.   ""This is worrisome given that we are a country whose economy is trying to grow from a decade long of economic decline,"" said Ncube on the sidelines of the 2013 corruption perception index launch. ""Corruption discourages foreign direct investment and as a country which wants investors this is not healthy.""   TIZ has since established a mobile phone short messages platform to enable the public to report cases of corruption.   Ncube said the platform had recorded huge volumes of reports of corruption from the public, meaning that people wanted corruption to be nipped in the bud. She said the reports were being forwarded to the Police and Zacc but people were not seeing the desired results.   ""As an organisation which is not allowed by law to investigate or to represent people in the courts of law, we will also be waiting for the Police and the Anti-Corruption Commission to act on these cases,"" said the TI-Z boss. ""But the bottom line is people end up being frustrated because no action will have been taken on the reported cases.""   A social commentator, Nicholas Ndawana believes poor remunerations for civil servants - including the police - was promoting corruption.   ""I put the blame on government which is not remunerating its workers well. We must understand that these guys in public office have families to feed and yet they are earning peanuts. If they find a chance of accepting a bribe or soliciting for bribes, they will not waste it. It is common sense,"" he said.   But TI-Z chairman, Loughty Dube disagreed, saying corruption was not driven by poverty.   ""It is a matter of ethics. It does not need one to be poor to be corrupt. I want to tell you that the high-profile officials who are involved in corruption have millions of dollars in their bank accounts,"" he said.   Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) commissioner-general, Gershom Pasi recently said it was estimated that the country lost about US$2 billion to corruption last year.   Corruption in Zimbabwe is not only limited to high-profile individuals.   For most car owners and drivers, before preparing for a journey, they have to make sure that they have extra cash for the traffic police. Without the extra money, they may end up spending hours at roadblocks, and sometimes at police stations, simply because they would have resisted giving the cops a ""token"". The same applies when one wishes to obtain a passport. Corruption at the congested Makombe building in Harare starts at the queue. People have to pay to jump the queue, even before they see the officials who work at the passport offices.   All these corrupt activities happen and are reported to the authorities through suggestion boxes, short massages and other platforms.   But experts said most of the cases were not taken up because the accused would be the one receiving the same reports.    NO ACTION TAKEN AGAINST CORRUPT MINISTERS    President Robert Mugabe also recently alleged that former Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC) chairman, Godwills Masimirembwa demanded and received a US$6 million bribe from William Ato Essien of Ghana, who wanted to invest in the country's diamond sector. Masimirembwa denied the allegations and the case appears to have died a natural death as the Ghanaian investor is said to be hesitant to come to Zimbabwe to make an official complaint.   Last year, Mugabe confirmed that some of his ministers were corrupt to the core, demanding bribes of up to US$10 million from potential foreign investors. But no action has been taken against the suspects.    <p class='syndigate_disclaimer'>Œ© Copyright 2013 The Standard."176,The Standard (Zimbabwe),2/9/2014,Mugabe must lead corruption fight - The Standard,,ZIMBABWE (94%),1277,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,9-Feb-14,,374  words,CORRUPTION (90%); MISCONDUCT (78%); EXECUTIVES (78%); BRIBERY (78%); WAGES & SALARIES (77%); POLICE FORCES (77%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (76%); COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS (75%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (73%); INVESTIGATIONS (72%); WORKPLACE MORALE (71%); BROADCASTING INDUSTRY (71%); SUITS & CLAIMS (69%); CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (69%),"Zimbabweans were told last week that President Robert Mugabe had been ""angered"" by the extent of the corruption and plunder of public funds through ridiculously high pay cheques and hefty allowances paid to top officials.     The Standard Editorial    Only the gullible must have believed that Mugabe was not aware of the looting at public institutions. The case of the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) workers, for example, was well-publicised. Disgruntled employees who had gone for months without pay last year wrote letters to the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission and the Ministry of Information detailing the looting at ZBC.   They exposed how Chief Executive Officer Happison Muchechetere and other top managers earned astronomical salaries while they wallowed in poverty. Muchechetere even tried to cover his tracks by suing this paper which carried stories about the looting at the state broadcaster.   It baffles the mind that Mugabe may have failed to hear about these accusations and reports about corrupt activities happening at other parastatals.   These reports prompted the inclusive government to push for a corporate governance framework, to stop the rot. Mugabe himself launched the drive which was spearheaded by former State Enterprises minister, Gorden Moyo. There is no way Mugabe, who has a tight grip on all state institutions and receives detailed intelligence briefings, could have failed to know the malfeasance at parastatals which have bled the economy for a long time.   We discern an attempt to clean up Mugabe's image which has been soiled by the sordid details of corruption happening under the Zanu PF government's watch. Mugabe should move out of this denial mode and own up, that corruption has spiralled out of control and drastic measure have to be adopted if society is to be rid of the culture of looting. He needs to show leadership by openly denouncing the plundering at the parastatals, naming and shaming the looters like he did in the case of Godwills Masimirembwa whom he accused of soliciting a US$6 million bribe.   Mugabe should also instruct Police Commissioner General, Augustine Chihuri to investigate Masimirembwa and other officials accused of milking public bodies and PSMAS."177,The Standard (Zimbabwe),3/9/2014,Failure to deal with corruption will ruin the economy - The Standard,,ZIMBABWE (94%); ETHIOPIA (94%); MALAYSIA (79%); AFRICA (79%),1277,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,9-Mar-14,,634  words,CORRUPTION (92%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); ECONOMIC NEWS (88%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (75%); MUSLIMS & ISLAM (75%); RELIGION (75%); POLITICS (75%); ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES (75%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (75%); BRIBERY (73%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (70%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (69%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (65%),"The story of corruption has been spoken and written about for a long time now that most Zimbabweans thought that by now some corrupt government officials would be facing the wrath of the law, but unfortunately, that has not happened. Sunday View with Kimion Tagwireyi    It appears that only the less powerful are being brought to book while notoriously dirty giants masquerade as clean men. Is anyone above the law? Delays or failure to curb corruption will eventually ruin Zimbabwe. Corruption causes many political, economic, social and environmental challenges.   A few days before World Anti-Corruption Day in December, the department of Islamic Development in Malaysia, Jakim urged Muslims to combat corruption, saying that it could ruin their nation, ""the scourge of corruption can destroy good values, justice, oppress people and ruin democracy.""   Well-said Jakim; we must be reminded that corruption undermines democratic institutions, slows down economic development and contributes to governmental instability.   An organ devoted to fighting corruption in Ethiopia; Transparency Ethiopia says that corruption causes many political, economic, social and environmental challenges. ""Politically, corruption impedes democracy and the rule of law. Corruption leads public institutions to lose legitimacy when they misuse their power for private interests.""   There are countless, regrettable effects of corruption which affect innocent lives. The Ethiopian organisation against corruption explains that corruption negatively impacts the society; leading to political intolerance, lack of accountability and low levels of democratic culture. ""And economically, corruption leads to the depletion of national wealth as diversion and misallocation of national resources, conversion of public wealth to private and personal use rises . . .""   ""Large scale corruption therefore severely hurts the economy and impoverishes the entire population. In social sphere, corruption discourages people from working together for the common good.   Frustration and general apathy among the public result in a weak civil society. Demanding and paying bribes becomes the tradition . . .,"" says Transparency Ethiopia. ""Closer home, corruption is said to have been one of the critical factors leading to the downfall of past regimes by way of undermining the legitimacy of the governments and weakening their structures, reducing productivity, hindering development, worsening poverty, marginalising the poor, creating social unrest and then to their downfall...""   Corruption continues to be one of the greatest factors of poverty and internecine conflicts in developing countries. Although Africa is endowed with natural resources, we continue to struggle and scramble for a position in the lower rungs of the United Nations Development index. We keep grappling with the ever-changing trends in global politics, economic and technological advancements due to the debilitating effects of corruption.   One of the greatest impacts of corruption normally rises from the choices and priorities of governments. This happens when real development priorities of a country are often neglected in favour of those that generate biggest personal gains for the decision-makers.   In our case, Zimbabweans are questioning why most of our political leaders become filthy rich when they get into government. What really made our leaders so wealthy, when Zimbabwe was getting so poor? Why is the wealth gap between leaders and the public so big now, if leaders have not been squandering public resources for personal interests?   The Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc) should be capacitated for it to bring all bigwigs implicated in corruption to book. No one must be spared regardless of political or social standing."178,Daily Nation (Kenya),4/16/2013,CJ appoints 60 anti-corruption magistrates,,KENYA (94%),1144,Newspaper,ALLAN ODHIAMBO aodhiambo@ke.nationmedia.com -1,ENGLISH,,12-Jul-13,,524  words,CORRUPTION (93%); APPOINTMENTS (92%); MONEY LAUNDERING (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); FINANCIAL CRIME COUNTERMEASURES (90%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (90%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (90%); MAGISTRATES (90%); POLITICALLY EXPOSED PERSONS (89%); REGULATORY COMPLIANCE (89%); SCANDALS (78%); PUBLIC FINANCE (78%); BANKING & FINANCE REGULATION (74%); BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (74%); CIVIL SERVICES (74%); EXECUTIVES (74%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (74%); RISK MANAGEMENT (71%); EXCISE & CUSTOMS (69%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (66%); EXCHANGE RATES (65%); COMMERCIAL BANKING (62%),"Chief Justice Willy Mutunga has appointed 60 special magistrates to handle cases on anti-corruption and economic crimes. All in the rank of principal magistrates, the officers will occasionally be moved to new stations, Dr Mutunga said. The appointment of special magistrates is a requirement of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act. ""A special magistrate may pass upon any person convicted by him any sentence authorised by law for the punishment of the offence of which such person is convicted,"" the Act partly states. Corruption and economic crimes remain a major concern among Kenyans who continue to agitate for action by the government and the political class. Several regulations such as the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Regulations 2013 have been drafted to try and tame the menace through which a lot of resources are plundered. According this law, dealings by elected officials and top public servants will be placed under close scrutiny under a new regulatory regime meant to keep dirty money out of circulation. The rules which buttressed the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act, 2010 were published early this month by former Finance minister Njeru Githae. Money laundering The regulations limit the amount of money that one can carry while entering or leaving Kenya at $10,000 (Sh855,000) at the current exchange rates. ""Any person intending to convey into or out of Kenya monetary instruments equivalent to or exceeding $10,000 or its equivalent in Kenya shillings or any other currency, shall before doing so declare the particulars of those monetary instruments to a customs officer,"" the rules state. They aim to curb illegal dealings that compromised the integrity of civil servants especially during the Goldenberg and Anglo Leasing scandals. ""A reporting institution (mostly commercial banks) will be required to take adequate measures to establish the source of wealth and the source of funds which are involved in the proposed business relationship or transaction where a customer or beneficial owner is a politically exposed person,"" the new regulations state. Institutions transacting business with public officials will be required to obtain information on the immediate family members or close associates of the officers with authority over the account. ""A reporting institution shall have appropriate risk management systems to determine whether the customer or beneficial owner is a politically exposed person,"" the rules state. Nature of account The reporting institutions will be filing their money laundering findings with the Financial Reporting Centre with regard to purpose of the transaction, volume and nature of account. ""A reporting institution will be required to review public sources of information on the politically exposed person,"" the rules say. Those to be placed on the watch list for money laundering activities include members of the Cabinet, senior executives of State corporations, top political party officials, senior military officials and other members of the disciplined forces and members of the Judiciary.

In a letter to the ethics commission's chief executive, Mr  Halakhe Waqo Wednesday, Mr  Keriako Tobiko said that the order was due to the recommendations of the Supreme Court that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission officials involved in procurement irregularities be investigated. On Wednesday, Supreme Court judges recommended the investigation and possible prosecution of electoral commission officials who may have been involved in impropriety during the procurement of electronic equipment. In the detailed judgment on the presidential election petition, the judges said it was likely that the procurement of the electronic systems was marred by competing interests involving impropriety or even criminality at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). The judgment was giving details on why the  court threw out the petition filed by Cord presidential candidate Raila Odinga and upheld the election of Mr Uhuru Kenyatta as President. ""We recommend that this matter be entrusted to the relevant State agency for further investigation and possible prosecution of suspects,"" the judges said. Evidence supplied by the electoral commission showed that the failure of the Electronic Voter Identification and the Results Transmission Systems mainly arose from misunderstandings and squabbles within the commission during the procurement. The investigation is to target the procurement of Electronic Voter Identification Devices and the Results Transmission System, which stalled during the March 4 elections rendering the electoral process questionable and doubtful. The anti-corruption commission is investigating the controversial procurement of Biometric Voter Registration kits previously billed at Sh3.9 billion. The procurement collapsed  and the 15,000 kits that were bought through a government-to-government deal between Kenya and Canada were supplied by a French aeronautical firm, Safran Morpho, at a cost of Sh9 billion. ""This is, therefore, to request the commission in terms of its constitutional and legal mandate to consider the aforementioned recommendations of the Supreme Court of Kenya with a view of undertaking appropriate investigations,"" Mr Tobiko said. He also told the anti-corruption chief to supply his office with the final report, findings and recommendations as soon as investigations are concluded. Yesterday, the IEBC election committee chaired by commissioner Yusuf Nzibo was still holding a meeting at the hotel InterContinental to lay the ground for its own internal audit of the conduct of the March 4 elections. The 5,000 voter identification machines were to be used for speedy identification of voters while the results were to be transmitted using gadgets from the 34,000 polling centres. An internal memo by the commission's head of IT, Mr Dismas Ong'ondi, warned the commission of the risks posed by the kits, also referred to as e-poll books, which were to be supplied by a South African firm. In a letter dated December 6, 2012 and addressed to Mr Wilson Shollei, the Deputy Commission Secretary (Support Services) and copied to the CEO, Maj (Rtd) James Oswago, Mr Ong'ondi advised the election team not to award the kits tender to Face Technologies because of the risk that the equipment on offer might not work. Mr Ong'ondi had warned that the kits required more time and a parallel technology for them to function optimally. He also warned that the device to be supplied by Face Technologies was different from the concept model and the one initially proposed. ""Considering the strict timelines, this will give the commission very limited time to carry out the necessary configurations, testing and deployment to all the polling stations in the country,"" he said. Yesterday, IEBC said it welcomed calls for investigations as ordered by the Supreme Court and promised to cooperate with the investigating agencies."180,Daily Nation (Kenya),4/18/2013,Son of Senegal's ex-president detained over corruption,,"SENEGAL (96%); WESTERN AFRICA (93%); VIRGIN ISLANDS, BRITISH (79%)",1144,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,12-Jul-13,,244  words,LAWYERS (91%); CORRUPTION (91%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); HOLDING COMPANIES (76%); BUDGETS (76%); ARRESTS (73%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (54%),"Senegalese prosecutors on Wednesday formally charged Karim Wade, the son of the West African nation's former president, with corruption and ordered him to be detained without bail, his lawyer told Reuters.

""He has just been charged and will be detained,"" Demba Cire Bathily, Wade's lawyer, told Reuters. The case brought has highlighted efforts by President Macky Sall, who defeated Abdoulaye Wade in a tense election last year, to crack down on corruption in the poor West African state. Karim Wade simultaneously held the post of minister for infrastructure, international cooperation, energy and air transportation, with a total budget equivalent to one-third of state expenditure. Prosecutors have accused Wade of having taken stakes in large sectors of the economy, including firms involved in managing Dakar's port, providing services at the current airport and building a second one outside the capital. Prosecutors say the former minister has been linked to these firms through a complex web of offshore companies based in locations including Panama, the British Virgin Islands and Luxembourg.

Githongo later fled to England, claiming that his life was in danger. In Nigeria, the director general of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration, Dr Dorothy Akunyili, waged a heroic battle from 2001 to 2008 with both local counterfeit drug manufacturers and wholesale imports of counterfeit drugs from China. She estimated that more than half of both locally-produced and imported drugs were of no value to the consumer and were potentially harmful. Assassination attempt Akunyili braved an assassination attempt and many attacks on her position and reputation, to contribute to cleaning up drug distribution in Nigeria. While she has had a major impact, many of the drugs in use in the country remain ineffective. The illicit distribution system continues to be profitable to those who control it. Italians Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, the heroes of the fight against the  in Sicily and chief prosecutors in the Maxi Trial of 474 Mafia suspects in 1986, were both tragically assassinated in 1992. As head of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in Nigeria from 2004 to 2007, Nuhu Ribadu conducted a whirlwind campaign during which many of Nigeria's senior political figures had charges brought against them.ŒæBetween 2004 and 2006, Ribadu's team investigated 2,000 cases, made a similar number of arrests, prosecuted more than 200 cases, achieved 88 convictions, and recovered more than $5 billion in stolen assets. A 270-page book, Global Corruption: Money, Power and Ethics in the Modern World, written by Laurence Cockcroft and published by L.B. Tauris late last year, analyses the causes of corruption, its current characteristics and trends, and its threat to the poor and overall economic growth. According to Cockcroft, the heroic efforts of individuals epitomised by Githongo, Falcone, and Ribadu have had a major impact in raising the profile of the fight against corruption. At the same time, they demonstrate the limits of individual action. Githongo did not succeed in having the several contracts collectively known as Anglo Leasing cancelled, but his actions added to the demands for Kenya's new Constitution (approved at referendum in 2010) to have an explicit anti-corruption strategy by appointing non-elected individuals as heads of ministries. Falcone and Borsellino dealt a major but not fatal blow to the Sicilian Mafia, as nearly three-quarters of the defendants at the Maxi Trial had their sentences shortened or repealed. Nuhu Ribadu established the principle of the liability of Nigeria's state governors for prosecution on corruption-related charges, but saw most of those cases withdrawn in Olusegun Obasanjo's last months in power and his own career as a prosecutor dramatically curtailed. ""Individual action of this kind in an endemically corrupt environment will hardly ever achieve long-term success,"" Cockcroft writes in his book. In the many countries where corruption is a key or determining factor in the national economy, the costs to economic growth have also been high. In Nigeria, for example, corruption has condemned most of the population to an income of less than $2 a day in a country with an average annual income from oil of $30 billion since 1970. The wealth generated by oil in Nigeria has risen to $1.2 trillion from 1980 to 2010 (or $10,000 per head of the current population). The temptation for the elite to acquire a slice of this for personal use has proved to be irresistible. But some of this access has been shared much lower down the social scale in a process known as ""bunkering"", which means illegal siphoning of oil from the major pipelines. Nigeria loses six million barrels of oil worth about $1.5 billion every year through this method in a racket from which the ""big men"" receive huge benefits and workers far down the scale are kept ""on side"". In Peru, corruption in the 1990s under Alberto Fujimori diverted resources to such an extent that only about half of the expected revenue reached the government. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the pattern of gigantic corruption initiated by former president Mobutu Sese Seko from 1961 to 1997 was synonymous with the diversion of resources away from the state to fund a patronage system, which eliminated any serious investment in health, education, and basic infrastructure. The total sum stolen by Sani Abacha The total sums stolen by Sani Abacha in Nigeria amounted to about five per cent of the country's GDP during his four-year reign as head of state, a figure similar to the one attributed to Fujimori during his 11-year presidency in Peru. In his analysis, Cockcroft, who is  a former chairman of Transparency International UK, observes that the common characteristics of corruption in today's world include the close relationship between personal enrichment and political survival, the willingness of international partners to participate in corrupt stratagems, and the extent to which dual systems facilitate this and make it difficult for formal institutions to control the corruption at the heart of the process. The accelerated globalisation of the world economy in the past 30 years, Cockcroft says, has stepped up corruption in different ways and facilitated secret and unrecorded flows. Secret and hidden corners of the world trading system have experienced a massive flow of funds, much of which are ultimately ""washed"" into formal trading and banking channels. Organised piracy, which has developed since 2005 off Somalia, the mining of coltan in eastern DRC, and a much broader spectrum of global trading in drugs, humans, and counterfeit goods, all fall into this category and feed the corruption in a range of countries, he adds. ""The case for combating corruption relentlessly is that it is a force which drives poverty, inequality, dysfunctional democracy, and global insecurity. Its most consistent victims are the poor, who constitute the majority of the population in low-income countries, and its most dramatic victims are the subjects of human trafficking. Its everyday victims are the citizens of the many countries where political funding is generated by corrupt means and where their voice is lost in the rush by elected politicians to pay off their backers,"" Cockcroft observes. According to the author, the shared ingredients of corruption often include the need for political finance, either to fight an election or to secure a regime in power, the personal enrichment of a head of state and his close family and associates, and the continued expansion and success of networks that depend on political cover from the state but work towards personal enrichment. Close relations with organised crime In many cases, members of the network have close relations with organised crime, may be engaged in illegal trade, and are able to deposit their corruptly gained funds in ""secrecy jurisdictions"" from where it may be recycled into the domestic economy. Cockcroft's book also discusses the main factors that drive corruption. At the level of small-scale or petty corruption, individuals are confronted with major pressures in a context that may prove to be overwhelming. Once they succumb to these, corruption proves to be contagious. At a national level, the key drivers are political funding, the interplay between organised crime and governments, and the role which local and multinational companies can play in using corruption to increase market share. According Cockcroft, political funding is probably the largest single driver of large-scale corruption. Deals which appear to be straightforward examples of grand corruption apparently tailor-made for the pockets of an individual or small team are in fact designed partly to secure the interests of a political faction or party - or simply a well-embedded governing elite. These interests may include bribing unsympathetic members of a congress or parliament to ensure the passing of specific legislation. ""Once funds are directed from these various sources to a party that achieves power, its obligations to local and multinational companies, and perhaps to organised crime, constitute a cocktail which will tend to stimulate rather than enable it to constrain corruption,"" he warns. In its Corruption Perceptions Index 2012 report, Transparency International observes that corruption is a major threat facing humanity. ""Corruption destroys lives and communities and undermines countries and institutions. It generates popular anger that threatens to further destabilise societies and exacerbate violent conflicts.ŒæCorruption translates into human suffering, with poor families being extorted for bribes to see doctors or to get access to clean drinking water. It leads to failure in the delivery of basic services like education or health care. It derails the building of essential infrastructure, as corrupt leaders skim funds."" Corrupt tendencies can lead to the total degradation of a state. ""A combination of highly corrupt procurement procedures, the diversion of budgetary funds from social expenditure, irresponsible foreign investment, and the accelerated degradation of natural resources can create the circumstances for a 'failed state.' Examples of this in the recent past include Sierra Leone, Liberia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo,"" Cockcroft writes. In the book Public Accountability and Good Governance in East Africa, Kituo Cha Katiba (KCK) singles out lack of government commitment, manifested by poor implementation or enforcement of policy, legal, and institutional framework, and a culture of impunity, as key factors that have thwarted the anti-corruption crusade in East Africa.ŒæThe other factor that complicates anti-corruption efforts in the region, KCK adds, is the fact that the officials mandated to fight corruption participate in it themselves. Immense government interference continues to thwart anti-corruption efforts. ""This makes corruption one of the worst governance issues in the East African countries,"" KCK observes. Cockcroft's book shows that, in spite of some progress, all forms of action in combating corruption still have a long way to go. The international community needs to recognise that so far, reform of corruption has been extremely limited. The momentum needs to be maintained. The challenges of this century can only be met successfully if the corruption dimension is built into policy action. ""Without this, action to combat it at country level will be flawed and progress on the issues of the 21st century will be hostage to the many and burgeoning forces of corruption,"" Cockcroft warns."182,Daily Nation (Kenya),6/19/2013,NCPB: Corruption will make docile Kenyans stage an uprising,,KENYA (94%),1144,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,12-Jul-13,"NAIROBI, KENYA (79%)",233  words,FOOD SECURITY (77%); GRAIN RESERVES (76%); CORRUPTION (73%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (72%); ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (69%); BRIBERY (68%); FERTILIZERS (67%),"The NCPB story makes sad reading; in fact I could have brushed it off as an isolated incident but unfortunately ours is a country of strange contradictions.

Various organisations and interest groups have occupied the social, economic and political space and at any given time there have been those who have felt left out. As we have been navigating the murky waters of developing our nation, there is one trait that has characterised us and which has had an adverse effect on our development.

When I see the way we all casually and helplessly look on as matatu drivers arrogantly break every possible traffic rule, I wonder whether we are going forwards or backwards. With all the talk about corruption, including setting up a constitutional commission to deal with it, there are many small things in our lives that border on corruption or are by their nature corrupt. There is a misconception that corruption is only those big things we hear about, like Goldenberg, Anglo Leasing and so forth. There is, however, a lot of corruption that goes on at the micro-level which we take for granted. I had an interesting experience recently when I attended a workshop organised by a body which is mandated to deal with matters of corruption. They booked us into a facility with small rooms that take only a bed and no space for a desk to work on. When I arrived and saw the room, I felt like going to look for an alternative but I argued that it would not be nice to leave my colleagues. The following morning, I realised that the organisers were staying in a different place. At tea break, I took one of them to my room and he said he was surprised. I was approached later with an offer to be moved to another room but I declined and asked whether they were going to move all the others. I suppose they could not see that as corruption.

Perhaps I should be forgiven for assuming the bemused IG just landed in Kenya the other day from Iceland. The issue of corrupt traffic policemen is as old as independent Kenya, and is not likely to go away on the President's say so. It would interest President Uhuru Kenyatta to know that this is a syndicate running smoothly on very well oiled wheels operated by the very top echelons within that police department. It is the fattened milk cow nobody at the traffic department would want killed. It is a vice that thrives on complicity. The imposition of heavy penalties for traffic offenders only helped entrench corruption on the roads and emboldened the cops to enforce a bargain that says ""me or the judge"". Nobody wants a date with the magistrate or judge so the answer doesn't need a lot of imagination to arrive at. A hungry, disillusioned policeman demanding a bribe of Sh1,000 to ignore a vehicle or matatu that is either overloaded, defective, unlicensed or speeding is a better proposition than spending unproductive hours at police stations and the courts where an intimidating magistrate has the optionof incarcerating one or imposing very heavy penalties. A review of traffic rules is overdue and emphasis should shift from heavy penalties to road discipline. The burden of enforcing discipline should lie with vehicle owners, especially matatus. Impounding a matatu whose crew flout rules for, say seven days, is bound to register more easily than fining someone Sh10,000, a cost he can easily recoup by overcharging. Secondly, vehicle owners should be the ones to face prison terms in the case of a conviction. There isn't a better deterrent than this for vehicle owners to read the riot act to their employees. Finally, the best-placed people to trap corrupt officers are motorists and the media, which have time and again aired explicit clips of policemen unashamedly taking bribes yet nobody has been taken to court on account of that. Equip the public with cameras andrecorders and you will be amazed at the number of officers caught red-handed. Policemen cannot be trusted to arrest their colleagues.

""You must, therefore, institute immediate measures to seal all corruption loopholes and ensure that maximum value is derived from every tax shilling for the benefit of our people,"" the President told the PSs during their swearing in at State House, Nairobi Thursday. President Kenyatta appealed to the public to play their role in fighting graft. He said Kenyans must particularly monitor the use of finances devolved to the counties. ""We must do all we can to ensure corruption is not devolved and thereby multiplied 47 times over. Should this happen, then the prospects for the development of our country will be very bleak indeed,"" President Kenyatta said. The President said public servants will be put on performance contracts and those who do not deliver will be shown the door.

He said the PSs should also embrace the key values and principles of efficient, effective and economic use of resources; responsive, impartial and equitable provision of services; accountability for administrative acts; transparency and provision of timely and accurate information to the public. He said it is PSs and Cabinet Secretaries responsibility to ensure the government is highly effective. President Kenyatta said PSs and Cabinet Secretaries should work closely for the government to run seamlessly and deliver services to Kenya. He said the PSs should put in place systems and processes that will ensure efficient service delivery, including service charters and performance contracts.

Mr Ouko told the Sunday Nation that operations in his office have been greatly hampered because the National Treasury allocated them a paltry Sh1.9 billion against their request of Sh4 billion. The allocation is the same as for the previous financial year despite his expanded mandate to audit the accounts of the 47 new counties. ""If they (Executive) cannot release my office's resources what does that tell you of their commitment to accountability?"" he said. Consequently, the auditor- general said the national and county governments can forget donor funding if the budget deficit to his office is not plugged. With the meagre allocation, Mr Ouko said his office would be forced to concentrate on  those counties and the national government where revenue was most at risk. (EDITORIAL: Give auditor-general's office more money) ""It means something else has to suffer, and most probably it would be the donor-funded projects, and the donors will likely withhold their funds if they are not assured that their funds will be well utilised,"" he explained. Parliament rejected allocating Sh1 billion more to the auditor-general's office during a heated debate on June 28. Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo had brought an amendment to the Appropriations Bill 2013 to the floor of the House seeking to reallocate Sh53 billion from the Ministry of Education vote to the Teachers Service Commission (TSC). Had the amendment been adopted, TSC would have obtained an additional Sh47 billion to meet teachers' allowances demands, with Sh3 billion going to the Registrar of Political Parties, while the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the office of the auditor-general would have received Sh1 billion each. Mr Midiwo's proposed amendment split the House with Majority Leader Aden Duale lobbying his troops to defeat it. He marshalled the support of 98 Jubilee MPs against Cord's 75 MPs and declared that the proposal could not pass because it was illegal. ""The auditor-general can appear before the budget and finance committees to bring up these issues. In fact these committees gave everybody concerned an opportunity to appear before them. So the auditor-general should use the right channel,"" said Mr Duale. Igembe South MP Mithika Linturi said the budget shortfall to the auditor-general, though a key concern, should be blamed partly on Mr Ouko for going through the Treasury instead of directly presenting his budget estimates to the National Assembly s the Judiciary and the constitutional commissions did. ""You understand how the Treasury mandarins operate,"" he added. The MP regreted that some reports from the auditor-general might be delayed in the absence of sufficient funding for the office to recruit more staff to audit the 47 counties and the State corporations. ""I want to confirm that the auditor-general's office fell short of the funding he had requested, but I will not agree with him that the government is not committed to the fight against corruption because I know what the President and the Deputy President have said on this,"" said Mr Linturi. But Mr Midiwo observed: ""I am looking at the future effect. Last year the auditor general got Sh1.8 billion to oversee one government, but now he has 47 other governments, a total of 48 to deal with, and you can see the governors have already started buying Prados and things that have little importance to the taxpayer. ""The corruption that we will see at the counties will be massiveŒæ because the Jubilee government has Œædenied the auditor-general the chance to prevent it. In any case, it would have made more sense to set up county audit offices before giving counties the cash. Otherwise the auditor-general will be playing catch up. ""This Jubilee government will pay dearly for rejecting the amendments I had tried to introduce to the Appropriations Bill and attempting to downgrade the top-most offices in the budgeting process that are Parliament, the auditor-general and the controller of budget. Someone is trying to kill devolution,""Mr Midowo added: ""I remember I had asked the parliamentary Committee on Finance, Planning and Trade Chairperson (Benjamin Langat) to explain the reason, but to date, the answer has not been provided."" Efforts to reach Mr Langat were futile as his phone was switched off. Mr Duale also defended the Jubilee government from accusations that it was not committed to the fight against corruption. ""There are other bodies that deal with corruption. It is not only the auditor-general's office. The auditor-general and other constitutional offices must also understand that in the budget-making process, the National Treasury uses certain ceilings, and no one can get money outside these ceilings,"" he said. The auditor-general is one of the two independent auditing and budget control offices in the Constitution, alongside the controller of budget. Prior to the promulgation of the Constitution in 2010, the two tasks were lumped together in a single office of the controller and auditor-general. The auditor-general's mandate is to ensure the revenue generated by both the national and county governments is not siphoned off. The office is mandated by the Constitution to audit accounts of all governments and State organs as well as accounts of political parties funded from public monies.Audit reports regarding the county functions are submitted to the county assemblies, while the audit reports of the national government go to the National Assembly. Parliament and the county assemblies are required to debate and consider the report and make appropriate recommendations. The auditor- general is also required to publish the respective reports for the public. Before March 4, the auditor- general's responsibility was only at one level, the national government, which consisted of ministries, about 300 State corporations and 175 local authorities under the ministries, the Judiciary, Parliament, the donor-funded projects and the debt of the country. Then, Mr Ouko told Sunday Nation, the responsibility was more narrow, and the Sh1.9 billion sufficed. ""But now, I have to audit the 47 counties and constitutional commissions and give an independent assurance to Kenyans that their money was well managed. I need more money to do this,"" he said. He said he was hoping the government would reconsider his office's needs in the supplementary budget."188,Daily Nation (Kenya),7/6/2013,Jacob Juma denies corruption allegations,,KENYA (94%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%),1144,Newspaper,ANDREW TEYIE ateyie@ke.nationmedia.com -1,ENGLISH,,16-Jul-13,,1143  words,CORRUPTION (74%); FASHION DESIGN (73%); WEALTHY PEOPLE (70%); FASHION DESIGNERS (68%); FASHION & APPAREL (68%); REAL ESTATE VALUATIONS (64%); APPEALS COURTS (60%),"Mr Jacob Juma's office, perched on the second floor of his Lavington Karbarsiran gardens building, overlooks James Gichuru road. A secretary leads one up the spiral staircase to the office which is on five acres of land. Before she knocks the door, which had been left ajar; a man in a soft raspy voice with a heavy Luhya dialect intonation welcomes me into the office. As the secretary recedes to the background, he walks round the curvy and well-polished desk made of palm timber for a firm, hearty handshake. And the man goes straight on to lodge his complaint on how the media has covered his case with the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB). After the handshake, he hesitates, perhaps sizing me up before walking back to his chair, behind the desk. There is nothing striking about his designer attire except the gold watch on his wrist. There is a huge painting on the wall behind his desk while, across him, is a flat screen TV mounted on the wall. On any day this office will pass for any normal office somewhere in Upper Hill. The first thing that strikes you when you meet Mr Juma is the opulence he displays. The man is chauffeured around in a Rolls Royce Phantom, a car associated with the upper crust in the richest societies of the world. His designer suits are imported from fashion houses of note and the man does not hesitate to describe his wealth. He especially revels in talking about his sprawling house in the heart of Karen, which he claims he started constructing in 1991 at the age of 24. ""I moved into my home at the age of 26. The timber in the house is drift timber. That is how special it is. I do not do laundry in my house. It is all done at Serena. From face towels to ... name it,"" states Mr Juma. In the office, you notice expensive collector items. Among them is the furniture made from palm timber and his gold laced cutlery. He hastens to explain that the gold is 18 carats. The office is adjacent to former Vice-President Moody Awori's home. He estimates the market value of the property to be Sh300 million. Ms Grace Wakhungu, Mr Awori's sister, was Mr Juma's business partner. Grace is the mother of Environment and Water Secretary Judy Wakhungu. So just who is this man, Mr Jacob Juma? The businessman who has been in the news for his plans to auction the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) is a complex figure, who has found his level in society after many run-ins with the high and mighty. In 1991, he bought 250 acres belonging to former President Moi's daughter, Jennifer, before Mr Moi stepped into the dispute that ended up in court. The matter is still at the Court of Appeal. The soft spoken businessman, who claims to have interests in mining, large-scale farming, real estate and construction, has a taste for the good things in life. During conversations, he reminds you that he is not cheap and corrupt and that is how he has ""managed to reach where he is in society and do the business he does"". But, like many businessmen, he hesitates to get into too much detail about how he has built his business empire. However, in confidence, he mentions companies listed in stock exchanges in North America, South Africa, Namibia, among others. At his office, an elderly woman in green and white-striped attire donning a white apron with a silver tray holding cups of tea interrupts our discussion. ""This is pure silver and 18 carats gold. Is this NCPB money?"" he poses, pointing at the tea pot and the cups. He proceeds to serve this writer tea with a word of caution that sugar is not good for health. As the discussion on Erad Supplies/NCPB payment dispute progresses, he interjects to state that he is a family man whose wife and children are feeling the full impact of negative publicity. ""I am big and wealthy. I have cushioned my family financially. However, this negative publicity on NCPB breach of my contract is adversely affecting my family,"" states Mr Juma, who goes ahead to display pictures of his family in his Karen home. His two children attend one of the prestigious schools in the country. ""I could be the only one with this car in this country,"" says Mr Juma of his black Rolls Royce Phantom.ŒæHe is proud of what he has achieved, insisting he is clean. ""If I was corrupt, you think I would have followed the channels I have to recover my money from NCPB? And there is no scandal here. These people breached a contract after I incurred huge costs and later losses to import maize from Ethiopia. This has nothing to do with supplying a grain of maize to NCPB"". Last year, Mr Juma raided NCPB to recover Sh500 million for breach of contract to supply 40,000 metric tonnes of maize to the country's national strategic grain reserve in 2004. Public Investments Committee (PIC) of Parliament is investigating the breach of contract which dates back to August 2004 when NCPB awarded his company, Erad Supplies, a contract to supply 40,000 metric tonnes of white maize. The contract between Erad and NCPB was signed on August 26, 2004 by NCPB managing director Tirop Kosgey and Erad Supplies managing director Grace Wakhungu and witnessed by Mr Baisama Duma. However, three months later, NCPB cancelled the tender due to lack of funds. Communication between then Special Programmes PS Mahboud Mohammed and Mr Kosgey shows how the contract was cancelled and a desperate attempt by Mr Kosgey to have Erad compensated for the breach in vain. ""We request you to take necessary action to resolve the matter by availing the required funds to facilitate performance of the contract,"" stated Mr Kosgey in one of the letters dated November 3, 2004 to Mr Mohammed. In an advertisement placed in the Daily Nation on October 21, 2004, then Agriculture minister Kipruto Kirwa states that there was a delay in releasing of funds. He states that government had not lost funds contrary to claims. On December 29, 2006, Erad, through lawyers Nancy Baraza and Company, invoked the arbitration clause in the contract after NCPB acting managing director AG Kamau denied liability. In response, Mr Kamau wrote: ""We deny liability for alleged breach of the aforesaid contract whose performance was frustrated due to government's inability to raise the funds required for opening the LC. Facts whereof are known to your client."" During the interview, Mr Juma gets animated when he talks about an affidavit from city debt collector Brian Yongo to Parliament. Mr Yongo testified last week. ""It's Mr Ahmednasir who brought Mr Yongo to my office here. He claimed that he was an auctioneer. I gave him a contract and when my lawyers did due diligence on him they discovered that he was a debt collector,"" stated Mr Juma. In the affidavit, Mr Yongo argues that he introduced Mr Juma to Mr Abdullahi to represent his company in the Erad Vs NCPB case. In court documents, Mr Abdullahi represented Erad in arbitration proceedings on February 24, 2009."189,Daily Nation (Kenya),7/9/2013,Kenya tops region's corruption league,,"KENYA (95%); EASTERN AFRICA (93%); AFRICA (93%); UGANDA (92%); SIERRA LEONE (92%); LIBERIA (92%); SUDAN (79%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (79%); ETHIOPIA (79%)",1144,Newspaper,AGGREY MUTAMBO amutambo@ke.nationmedia.com -1,ENGLISH,,16-Jul-13,,419  words,CORRUPTION (92%); RANKINGS (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); BRIBERY (89%); POLICE FORCES (88%); POLICE MISCONDUCT (78%); CIVIL WAR (76%); POLLS & SURVEYS (76%); POLITICAL PARTIES (73%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (73%); POLITICS (68%),"Kenya is among the most corrupt countries in the world, a report released by an anti-graft watchdog shows. The country has been ranked number four in the Global Corruption Barometer released by Transparency International (TI) on Tuesday. The top three countries are Sierra Leone, Liberia, Yemen then Kenya follows at number four. The top three countries have been torn apart by civil wars and Kenya is the only country in the top four that has not experienced civil strife. The barometer also showed that Kenya is also the most corrupt country in East Africa and the third in Sub-Sahara. At 70 per cent, it means Kenya is perceived poorest in East Africa in fighting corruption, followed by Uganda (61) and Tanzania (56). The report shows that people bribed their way in eight key sectors of public service but the police, lands department, Parliament, education system and the Judiciary led this poor grade. On a scale of 1 to 5, where one indicated ""not all corrupt"" while five showed ""extremely corrupt"", 1,121 Kenyans interviewed nationally perceive the police, Parliament, Judiciary and political parties as most corrupt with scores of between 3.5 and 4.8. The perception of corruption in the police service and the judiciary remains ""unchanged"" from previous studies, according to the report. This is despite the fact that the Judiciary under Chief Justice Willy Mutunga has put in place efforts to combat graft by issuing annual accountability reports, opening up channels of communication and increasing pay for judges. As for the police service which is currently under a new leadership of Inspector General David Kimaiyo, about 60 per cent of respondents told the researchers that they had to pay a bribe to get out of trouble, a fact also identified in previous barometers. According to TI, respondents complained that they had to part with ""petty bribes"" whenever they sought help from the lands registry. Average bribes ""The average bribe paid for land services is more than US$100 (Sh9,842) in Kenya and the average  bribe paid to the Judiciary in Uganda is more than US$200 (USh594,137),"" the report stated. Other Eastern African countries such as South Sudan and Ethiopia scored below 50. ""In too many countries, the institutions people rely on to fight corruption and other crime are themselves not trusted,"" a statement from Transparency International said. People in 36 countries including Kenya view police as the most corrupt, with at least half of people interviewed saying they had been asked to pay a bribe."190,Daily Nation (Kenya),7/10/2013,Fight against corruption requires change of tack,,KENYA (94%),1144,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,16-Jul-13,"NAIROBI, KENYA (58%)",103  words,CORRUPTION (91%); BRIBERY (88%),"A new report ranking Kenya fourth as the most corruption-ridden country in the world is sad news.

After losing to regional countries in many contests, Kenya has emerged tops in an activity that it has perfected over the years. Hey, this has nothing to do with athletics, cricket, rugby or football. It is not in any way connected with those games which have laid down rules. True, Uganda ""took"" Kenya's gold medal in the marathon during the Olympic Games in London last year, but even if Kenya fails to participate in international athletics meets for a decade, its medal tally will still be higher than the combined tally of all the regional countries. But I digress. For the past several months, many ""studies"" have shown how Kenya is tripping, and falling behind regional countries in several contests. I have to admit that I have been steadfast in, almost obsessed with, reminding Kenyans about their losses, starting with the one they supposedly registered against Ugandans in the bar when some study claimed that the latter consume more alcohol. Then there was the State of the World Mothers 2013, a report by Save the Children which ranks Kenya lower than all its neighbours. The Global Mothers' Index concluded that Kenya is only doing better than Somalia in terms of maternal and infant mortality. Some months back, there were reports that Uganda's tourism sector grew by 25 per cent, while South Africa and Tanzania realised growth rates of 21 per cent and 13.4 per cent respectively - and Kenya was not anywhere near them. A few weeks back, there was another report which declared Tanzania the best destination for safari tourism. This last one came at a time when Kenyans were so busy shouting themselves hoarse - mostly at each other - over the US President's visit to some three African countries, and they did not have the energy to protest over the study that placed them behind Tanzanians on the safari trail. But all that is now water under the bridge, and Kenya can now hold its head high, give itself a pat on the back and take a lap of honour because it has eventually gained a seat at the high table among other great nations. Trust Kenyans to whine about everything and fail to see the blinding light at the end of the pitch black tunnel. But the latest report should make them happy since it is proof that their efforts are eventually paying off and the country is being recognised in the global market of corruption. According to Global Corruption Barometer released exactly a week ago by Transparency International, Kenya is the fourth most corrupt country in the world after Liberia, Sierra Leone and Yemen. To put it in a simple manner which everybody will understand, Kenyans are very corrupt, after all, Kenya Ni Jina, Nchi Ni Wewe. Well, Kenya has been mentioned in previous surveys, but it has never passed the corruption test with such flying colours like it has done. Of course Kenyans have a right to whine all that they want at being placed fourth since they know that deep down inside their pockets - based on how prolific they are in engaging in corrupt practices - they should be top-ranked. Like with long-distance races, are there any other people who can beat Kenyans when it comes to passing something under the table to that long-suffering police officer, that government official, that politician, that judicial officer just to grease the wheels of the alternative economy which in essence is the main economy? Things have to move - how else would Kenya be the region's biggest economy and one of the fastest growing in the world, with the most vibrant construction, information technology, media and crime sectors just to name a few? There are miscreants who are itching to go against the grain, the collective national mindset and discredit the report, and even claim it is a part of a wider underhand scheme by Western nations to give Kenya a bad name, but there is no sector, anything or anybody which could have grown in this country if corruption was totally non-existent. Kenya has been very stable thanks to level-headed, highly-educated God-chosen leaders with Solomonic qualities and if corruption was such a bad thing, then they could not have nurtured it, fostered it and encouraged it at all levels of governance and livelihoods. Corruption has grown in Kenyans and vice versa; it is the only way of life, the legal tender in all transactions, the best form of negotiation, the capital in politics, the building blocks in all structures, the glue that holds the Kenyan society together in maternity wards, hospitals, jails, schools, churches, polling centres, farmlands, entertainment joints, newsrooms, courts, police stations, big and small offices, informal settlements, palatial residences, on the streets, superhighways and even in mortuaries, cemeteries and crematoriums. In Kenya, corruption is the alpha, the omega and everything in between - the shield and defender to forever hold, love and cherish without which this nation would not have grown, developed and become known. Corruption is that bottomless pit Kenyans of all walks of life have comfortably dug themselves in - and no matter how loud they wail, their voices will never be heard because they are still happily digging. Let us take the blame for our medical mishaps... It is no secret that Kenyans never waste an opportunity to blame outside forces whenever they encounter a problem. There is this notion that we are always innocent even when the reality on the ground shows otherwise. ""That is the work of my enemies,"" politicians invariably wail even after they have been caught red-handed, and before long, their supporters follow suit and blame people they do not know, have never seen and probably will never see. We cannot, and should not even make an attempt to deny the fact that we have never internalised our own shortcomings even as they continue to cause untold sufferance and deaths like it happens at Kenyatta National Hospital, the country's biggest referral hospital. According to Richard Lesiyampe, the Principal Secretary in charge of environment, who until the other week was the CEO of KNH, the national referral hospital cannot meet its objectives because corrupt doctors and administrators do not buy medical equipment with the funds allocated for the purpose. He said that there are some doctors ""who only make technical appearances at KNH and do not attend to patients yet they are paid huge salaries."" I highly doubt if those doctors and administrators are foreigners. ...and road carnage The other day, it was reported that the victims of road accidents in the past six months have surpassed that of road accident victims for the whole of last year. Well, some safety measures were put in place last year amid pomp and chest-thumping, and the authorities were emphatic that the rules would reduce road carnage. Of course there was gnashing of teeth by passenger service vehicle operators who felt the rules were too punitive and only the traffic police officers were going to gain. I hold no brief for the police service, but whenever Kenyan motorists are asked why there are so many road accidents, they do not talk about their poor driving habits, but they blame the traffic police officers for not being strict and only being too ready to accept bribes. But these police officers never bribe themselves - they are bribed by the motorists, Kenyan motorists I should add, the same people who drive recklessly, cause accidents then complain that traffic police officers only take bribes and do not arrest reckless motorists. Is that what is called a conundrum?"193,Daily Nation (Kenya),8/7/2013,GESAMI: Improved governance the best way to reduce corruption,,KENYA (96%),1144,Newspaper,RACHEL GESAMI -1,ENGLISH,,7-Aug-13,,756  words,POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); TREASURY DEPARTMENTS (75%); CIVIL SERVICES (71%); TAX LAW (71%); TAXES & TAXATION (68%); INFRASTRUCTURE (56%); LICENSES & PERMITS (50%),"Governance is the institutional capability of public institutions to provide the public and other goods demanded by Kenyans in an effective, transparent, impartial, and accountable manner, subject to resource constraints. Accountability and transparency are, therefore, at the heart of efforts to improve governance. Corruption often flourishes where institutions are weak, where the rule of law and formal rules are not rigorously observed, where political patronage is rife, and where the independence and professionalism of the public sector have been eroded. Once entrenched, corruption hinders economic performance, increases the cost of public investment, lowers the quality of public infrastructure, decreases government revenue, and makes it burdensome for citizens to access public services. It also undermines the legitimacy of government. Combating corruption is not straightforward or easy. But it is not impossible, especially with increased public awareness of the problem. Indeed, as the costs and consequences of corruption have become more publicly known, efforts to fight it have intensified. Although results take time, civil society organisations and the media have made corruption a public issue and challenged government to address it. Broad coalitions of civil society, the private sector, and government are required to combat corruption, underpinned by reforms that increase accountability and transparency. Therefore, Kenya needs to adopt anti-corruption strategies that are realistic, achievable, and consistently implemented; they also have to be Kenya-specific, because what works in one country may not work in another. Today, we all know that Kenya has made a lot of progress by reforming to some degree, tax laws and investment codes, elimination of price controls, reduction of permits and licences and revising public procurement procedures. By contrast, stop-start efforts, a piecemeal approach, over-emphasis on legal measures, and sporadic anti-corruption campaigns are unlikely to yield lasting results. Specialised agencies and anti-corruption bodies can only be effective if they have sufficient independence, authority and resources. Ineffective bodies that lack real power can undermine rather than enhance public accountability.We all agree that a professional, meritocratic, and qualified public service is essential to ensure effective and efficient delivery of public services and to combat bureaucratic corruption. In Kenya today, public agencies - our most direct point of contact with government - is synonymous with poor service and inefficiency. Popular dissatisfaction undermines confidence in public institutions, undermining government legitimacy. Just as other state institutions need to adapt to changing circumstances and be made more efficient, cost effective, and accountable, so does the public service. In Kenya, this will require a fundamental change in orientation. In the past, efforts at civil service reform have mostly been in the context of adjustments; programmes negotiated with Kenya's development partners and have focused on reducing the wage bill rather than on improving quality. While capacity has increased in some areas i.e. (Central Bank, National Treasury) there has been little progress developing public service institutions. Revitalising public service agencies will, therefore, require transparent, merit-based recruitment procedures, promotion based on performance, sound management, in service-training and career development, and interlocking checks and balances to counter corruption. Internal rules that deal with professional ethics have to be consistently and impartially applied.ŒæPiecemeal reforms are unlikely to be more than short-term palliative - what is needed is an over-arching strategy for sequencing changes. Political commitment at the highest level is also needed if reforms are to be successfully implemented. Pay policy in public sector has especially been challenging since independence. The public sector has been subjected to severe wage compression. But at the high-skill end, even after a recent trend toward widening differentials as part of the reform programmes, earnings are often far below market levels. As a result, the government cannot  retain qualified technical people. Unless a way is found to improve pay at the higher levels, it will be impossible to attract, retain, and assure the integrity of highly skilled public officials.

A cursory glance at local dailies, news channels and social talk in the last month reveals questionable financial malpractices covering the entire spectrum in the public sector. This is a sad state of affairs as we strive to become a middle income economy by 2030. Could we then say that the Sh1.6 trillion proposed expenditure this financial year is safe amidst the demonstrated financial malpractices? Reading the Constitution reveals various commissions and state agencies set up to check malpractices. So how come this trend continues with a rapid increase in the amounts involved? Should we continue using the same methods to fight the war against fraud, corruption, wastage and abuse of public resources? Without casting any blame or pouring cold water onto ongoing efforts to fight corruption, we are either too slow or too late in reacting to these malpractices in a deterrent manner. Most of these agencies come into the picture long after the horse has bolted. Is it good enough talk about where and how money has been lost and service delivery compromised, while the perpetrators drag the oversight agencies in long, frustrating litigation games? We need to strengthen institutions and mechanisms of ensuring that most of these anomalies are detected, deterred and acted upon in real time. The oversight agencies must be proactive if we are to sustain the fight against corruption. Whereas fiscal accountability has been the major focus of the Auditor General, there is need for continuous auditing if we are to respond to managerial accountability and assessment on service delivery. The new dispensation not only requires the Auditor General to determine whether the books of accounts are correct or not, but how the resources are managed and the impact in terms of changing lives of ordinary Kenyans. The constitution in 229 (4 and 6) requires the Auditor General to report and confirm whether or not public money has been applied lawfully and in an effective way. Focus on managerial accountability is going to be important because it responds to Kenyans' urge to see the top management uphold the principles of leadership and integrity under Chapter Six and the values and principles of public service under Chapter Thirteen of the Constitution. Consequently, offices such as the Auditor General must respond to Kenyans' urge for greater accountability. The Auditor General's involvement should no longer be a seasonal exercise that is done once a year but a continuous one that is relevant, timely, advisory and making appropriate recommendations to deter future malpractices. Internal audit in public institutions is critical, but only if effective. We may have to review the manner in which internal auditing function is constituted in terms of appointment, status and protection from management manipulation. There are many cases where internal auditors report to a much lower level in organizations for this function to be effective. The legal framework for internal audit should be clearly captured in a robust Public Audit Act. The Office of the Auditor General is drafting one.

His remarks come at a time when Chief Registrar Gladys Shollei is facing the Judicial Service Commission over allegations of impropriety. Mrs Shollei has denied any role in the loss of Sh1.2 billion in the judiciary.

She would have been horrified at the senseless slaughter of innocents. The Nobel Peace Prize Laureate was a humanist above all else and she would have wept at the scale of the carnage. But one part of her would have wondered what would have been if authorities in government had listened to her repeated pleas that the entire area around where both Nakumatt Westgate and Nakumatt Ukay stand is a wetland on which no construction should have taken place. In African society, they say one should not appraise the life of a dead man too closely during the mourning period before they have been buried. Now that the immediate horror of the events at Westgate has faded somewhat we must, as a society, reflect on the lessons to be drawn from that disaster.One of them is that corruption is a cancer that is the leading contributor to many of our self-inflicted crises. The question is often asked why Ethiopia, which has brutally intervened in Somalia many times and which has a bigger ethnic Somali population than Kenya's, does not suffer terrorist attacks. The answer is that Ethiopians are at once fiercely patriotic and much less corrupt than other East Africans with the possible exception of Rwanda under Paul Kagame.And not just Ethiopian public officials. Ordinary Ethiopians are the main guarantors of their nation's peace. Perhaps because of their history with Marxism, they have the Nyumba Kumi (Ten Houses) community policing set-up which means that a suspicious stranger would be reported very rapidly to the authorities. In Kenya, the people charged with protecting the nation's borders - the immigration department and the police - are legendary for their appetite for bribes. In a 2010 paper on the foreign Jihadist element within al-Shabaab, Prof David Shinn, an American academic and former ambassador, noted that one of the challenges Osama bin Laden faced in trying to set up a base in Somalia was the level of corruption in countries such as Kenya which was a key conduit for men and material. ""Al-Qaeda underestimated the cost of operating in Somalia. Getting in and out of the countryŒæwas costly, while expenses resulting from corruption in neighbouring states were high."" Al-Shabaab certainly exploited that culture of corruption in planning and executing their latest attack. There is no evidence that corruption was involved in giving planning permission for the construction on the contentious plots in Westlands. But on March 6, 2009, Lands Minister James Orengo gave a press conference in which he said the government would demolish several buildings in that area. He pointed out that this zone was a riparian reserve (nature makes this point eloquently every time there is a heavy downpour because the area always floods). At any rate, he said, the City Council allocated the plots for construction of residential and not commercial developments. Nothing came of those threats. But one of the reasons the Westgate mall was identified as a prime terrorist target was the fact that it is so difficult to defend, standing as it does smack next to a road, in contrast to other malls in the city which have a security barrier some way away from the main building. The thing about Kenya is that we suffer the most spectacular reverses - the 1998 US embassy bombings, the 2007/8 post-election violence - but we also often learn lessons and rebound strongly. There are few countries in the world which have responded to a near-civil war with as comprehensive a set of reforms and institutional changes as Kenya has known in the last six years. The Westgate terror attack should be another wake-up call. We must see some major changes to our approach to security matters. We should take lessons from Ethiopia on training security personnel to love their country and to resist the temptation to sell out to terrorists for a few thousand bob. And we should re-examine the legacy of icons like Wangari Maathai and learn not to value development above values."198,Daily Nation (Kenya),10/15/2013,WALUBENGO: Can technology eliminate corruption?,,KENYA (93%); RWANDA (79%),1144,Newspaper,JOHN WALUBENGO -1,ENGLISH,,15-Oct-13,,530  words,CORRUPTION (91%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (90%); EMBEZZLEMENT (90%); MISAPPROPRIATION (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (76%); EXECUTIVES (73%); EPIDEMICS (50%); AIDS & HIV (50%),"The government has in recent times put more pressure in the implementation and use of the Integrated Financial Management Information (IFMIS) platform within ministries. IFMIS is a computerised financial system aimed at capturing and reporting government expenditure in near real-time. It is assumed that by automating the financial processes across all government departments and agencies, it would be easier to reign in on the rampant corruption and pilferages frequently occasioned by government officials when dealing with tax payers money. But is IFMIS the magical solution to our Kenyan problem of embezzling and misappropriating public funds? First, we must acknowledge that automation does improve transparency and accountability. Without automation, the Auditor General used to be 4-5 years behind the fact or event.  In other words, audited government reports used to be discussed in Parliament 4-5 years after the theft had taken place and the culprits had long moved on. With automation, it is possible for the Auditor General to file audited accounts within 1-2 years of the event and therefore putting preventive pressure on the culprits who now know that their actions would be discussed fairly soon and within the institutional memory of their colleagues. But automation without top leadership commitment to fight corruption will not yield the desired outcome.  Indeed, corrupt deals in government can never be successfully executed unless authorised or blessed from ""above"". In other words, if the Principal Secretary or the chief executive officer of a parastatal wishes to rip-off the public, they will still find ways and means to do so and cover their tracks. Unfortunately, there is no amount of automation that can prevent this. One quick way to do this is by incurring the expenditure outside the IFMIS tool - that is use the manual and verbal ways of authorising expenditure. Another method - with the help of compromised IT professionals - is to use the IFMIS tool but disable or outrightly delete the corresponding audit-trail. But if the IT team fails to cooperate, the determined  high ranking government official still has the option of compromising the Auditor General staff so that they conveniently forget to highlight significant queries. Beyond that, he or she can always think ahead and spare part of the fraudulent funds with view to ""talking"" to the Prosecution or eventually the Judge; to have the case disappear or dropped altogether for lack of adequate evidence. In summary, dealing with corruption requires the same approach as dealing with a mutating AIDS epidemic.  It requires a multi-pronged approach that involves multiple players with different interventions in order to be successful. Isolated IT automation of processes is not sufficient and can never be the single sliver bullet to end corruption. Rwanda's civil service is for example considered less corrupt than Kenya's - despite the fact that their automation levels are much lower than Kenya's. Perhaps it is because their executive, judiciary, prosecution and professionals practice zero-tolerance to corruption while we on the other hand seem to celebrate corruption and its perpetrators."199,Daily Nation (Kenya),10/21/2013,Shollei protests her sacking over corruption claims,,KENYA (90%),1144,Newspaper,JOHN NGIRACHU -1,ENGLISH,,21-Oct-13,"NAIROBI, KENYA (90%)",1492  words,CORRUPTION (91%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); ADMISSIONS & CONFESSIONS (78%); WITNESSES (75%); LAWYERS (72%); PUBLIC HEARINGS (71%); PUBLIC RELATIONS (69%); PRESS CONFERENCES (56%),"The former Registrar of the Judiciary, Ms Gladys Shollei, on Monday came out to declare her innocence over allegations of impropriety. The former Registrar of the Judiciary, Ms Gladys Shollei, on Monday came out to declare her innocence over allegations of impropriety that led to her sacking last Friday. And no sooner had she finished addressing a press conference at the Hotel InterContinental in Nairobi than the Chief Justice said the time had come for the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) ""to begin telling truths"" about her. Mrs Shollei accused the commission and Dr Mutunga of subjecting her to a ""kangaroo court."" But less than two hours later, Dr Mutunga said: ""The fight against corruption is not a public relations exercise, it is a serious undertaking based only on facts."" Mrs Shollei had said that no money was lost in the numerous transactions that the JSC has raised questions about. She also said there has been no corruption in the Judiciary. She also said contrary to what her former employer said last Friday, she did not admit to any of the 33 allegations against her in which it was alleged that Sh1.7 billion ""was at risk or has been lost"". ""The JSC never heard me,"" she said. ""I have never admitted to any single charge. For the Chief Justice to say that, and the JSC, it is totally dishonest."" She also gave a detailed version of events and allegations against her, besides answering the queries raised against her. According to her, the mandate of the JSC did not extend to questioning the management of the Judiciary. She also questioned the process that led to her sacking, alleging that four of the JSC commissioners were biased against her and were unlikely to give her a fair hearing. During the Friday meeting, she said, she had sought a public hearing and the opportunity to call witnesses during her defence, both of which had been denied her. She had also asked for a personal assurance from the Chief Justice that he was not at the head of a ""war council"" targeting her and then asked for an adjournment of the investigations. ""My lawyers requested for the ruling on the issues in writing in order to allow us to appeal their decision on those preliminary issues at the court,"" she said. The matters would have had to be determined by a court, she said, and she had assumed that the JSC would not discuss the matter further until the process of having the matter handled by a court was completed. ""However, two hours later, to my shock, I received a resolution of the JSC terminating my services,"" she said. ""They did not hear me so the only conclusion I derived is that the ruling was written a long time ago by the so-called War Council."" She said she was also surprised that the ruling and the allegations against her were ready so fast. She also claimed that the ruling had been made available to the Nation earlier. (The detailed story in the Saturday Nation was, in fact, based on documents posted on the Judiciary's website within an hour of the press conference at the Supreme Court Building on Friday.) Mrs Shollei's reference to a ""War Council"" originated from a trove of allegedly leaked emails made available to the press in the two months of drama at the Judiciary headquarters since the allegations against her first emerged. Declaring that there is a leadership problem at the Judiciary, the former registrar alleged that most of the ""young, brilliant, highly motivated, hardworking"" administrative staff have been threatened with removal. She said she was fighting on their behalf. When asked what her next course of action will be, she said: ""I'm still talking a lot to members of my family, with my friends, my spiritual leaders and my lawyers just to know what will be my course of action. But yes, I have many options but I do not have an exact option now. The only thing we told the JSC is that we have the right of appeal against their ruling."" In response to Mrs Shollei's accusations, Dr Mutunga said: ""The commission observes that the smear campaign fuelled by misinformation, distortion and outright lies that characterised the two-month disciplinary process against her continues."" Findings on the allegations against Mrs Shollei would be posted on the Judiciary's website (www.judiciary.go.ke) on Tuesday, he said. The conclusions made so far are from the JSC's internal investigations, Dr Mutunga said, and the truth would unravel as the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission  and other agencies start working on the case. Both the CJ and Mrs Shollei said they had invited the EACC to investigate the matter. Parliament has also turned its spotlight on the Judiciary. The Public Accounts Committee has ordered the Auditor General to conduct a special audit of the Judiciary in regard to the reports that some Sh80 million has been lost, that allowances paid are well beyond the set limits and that there have been large salary advances. Acting on a petition by a private citizen, the National Assembly's Justice and Legal Affairs, has asked individual members of the JSC to appear before it. (READ: Women MPs' threat to strip over Shollei sacking unwarranted) The JSC has previously refused to honour the committee summons. In reports posted on the Judiciary's website on Friday, Mrs Shollei was accused of receiving sitting allowances for meetings she didn't attend. She denied the allegation, saying, she was not in charge of determining who would be paid for sitting in meetings and didn't get the documents when she asked for them. She termed claims that she took an eight-month salary advance of Sh3.5 million as ""untrue and incorrect"" adding, she took a three-month advance in December 2011 and finished paying it in November 2012. She received another advance of Sh2.3 million, has repaid Sh680,000 and has a balance of Sh1.6 million. ""The salary advance was to enable me to raise the requisite deposit for the Judiciary Mortgage Scheme just like other Judiciary staff. The salary advance is not irregularly acquired money,"" she said. But JSC had said that ""regulations state that salary advances should not be for more than two months and should only be granted when an officer has no other outstanding advances."" On the leasing of Elgon Place, Mrs Shollei said the building was acquired through an open tender, the JSC was depending on draft documents and that everything else had been put in order. (READ: The Judiciary has not lost any money: Shollei) ""There is nothing irregular about making payment in foreign currency equivalent. Standard public bid documents allow bidders to request for payments in foreign currency. For commercial lease agreements within the CBD and its environs, it is common for the rent to be quoted in dollars,"" she said. Sealink Holdings, the building's owners, were reported to have been paid twice, but Mrs Shollei said the money had been taken from the Judiciary Training Institute because of a cash shortage at the headquarters. But the accountants at the headquarters had already processed the payment and lodged all the information in the technology-based accounting system, and this was detected and it was agreed that the amount would be off-set against future work for partitioning. The first payment was at Central Bank exchange rates and the second at Kenya Commercial Bank rates, she admitted, and the Sh1.1 million difference ""has been treated as part of the deposit and is reflected in the register of deposits for all leases."" Mrs Shollei's defence for the Sh58 million paid to Lekha Trading Company for cabling that the JSC had said was substandard was that it came at the end of the financial year and had been delayed due to a reorganisation at the procurement department. To avoid sending the money back to the Treasury, Lekha was paid the full amount against a bank guarantee. She refuted reports that the bank guarantee had expired and said the work had eventually been completed satisfactorily. She also denied allegations that she acted irregularly in the hiring of staff and awarding them perks and allocating vehicles without the approval of the JSC. ""It is a practice in government that officers who are on secondment move with their salary and benefits from their previous employers as per the circular of the Public Service Commission,"" she said. Mrs Shollei also defended the appointment of a Ms Anne Ng'ang'a, the chief administrator at her office, and a Mr Nicholas Okemwa, a legal counsel in the same office. She defended issuing cars to them, saying, ""it is at the discretion of the accounting officer, but the decision is based on the nature of the job of the assigned officer and the need for them to be available as and when requested at the shortest available time and for those who must work either very early or very late."" Mrs Shollei said her sacking came just as the transformation of the Judiciary had started gathering momentum, having made progress over the past two years with her at the helm."200,Daily Nation (Kenya),10/25/2013,Kenya's corruption rate has dropped - VIDEO,,"EASTERN AFRICA (95%); KENYA (94%); AFRICA (93%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (92%); UGANDA (92%); RWANDA (79%); BURUNDI (79%)",1144,Newspaper,Nation Correspondent -1,ENGLISH,,25-Oct-13,,261  words,CORRUPTION (92%); BRIBERY (91%); POLLS & SURVEYS (90%); POLICE FORCES (74%),"Kenya has jumped one place in East Africa bribery index.

At India's Economic Times e-Governance Forum, speakers stressed the importance of technology in disaster management, service delivery and eliminating poverty. India's Minister for ICT, Mr Ponnala Lakshmaiah, noted that technology had helped to reduce fatalities from cyclones from 10,000 per year in 1970 to 30 last year in the state of Ander Pradesh. He finished his speech by warning of a violent revolution if the gap between the rich and poor kept on widening. A number of other speakers reiterated that ICT was key in reducing the gap between the rich and the poor. The potential for job creation is clear. Digitisation of government records globally created six million jobs and $196 billion in new revenue last year. As the forum progressed however, it became clear that whereas the technical approaches to propagating ICT were clear, turf protection - or the silo mentality - was the elephant in the room. Just like in Kenya, each department here does what it wants without making reference to any other department.  Infrastructure that should be shared is duplicated, making seamless integration difficult. For example, biometric data that already exists in the passport department is also collected separately by the electoral commission. The Indian Permanent Secretary for e-Governance, Rajiv Gauba, wants to eliminate parallel government systems and multiple data centres by implementing cloud computing. He feels a government mandate is necessary because India's ministries are not ready for integrated services. At lunch break, I met Pradeem Kumar, who has been to Kenya. ""You guys are lucky that you can learn from us and implement things immediately"", he told me. ""Here, we have very powerful and corrupt state governments. This talk that resources will move from the centre to the goal is nonsense if kickers in the field are wearing shoes with nails.  The ball is always deflated before we can score."" Corruption starts from the assumption that you will never win. Anil, a governance expert had a different view. Corruption, he argued, would persist until governance was taught in India's institutions of higher learning, because factual knowledge was missing. ""India has the best brains any country can have, but they cannot put their finger on that thing,"" he said.

When more and more of such personalities are charged in court, a general consciousness against matters corrupt may just begin to evolve among citizens. The ultimate goal should be to see a new Kenyan mind-set that frowns upon the despicable cases of corruption we witness around us but dismiss casually. To arrest the culture of tolerating corrupt practices will mean more of what the anti-corruption body is doing. And the President's active blessings is naturally a very necessary condition. Those who previously thought that they would abuse their offices without consequences should now be made to feel that they will be answerable personally. And if the President and his deputy are facing charges in a court, why should economic saboteurs in our midst be allowed to get away with it? Kenya will be different in the next few years when we see more of these VIPs being brought to court in graphic fashion.

But the ministry is disputing the designation on the grounds  that claims of corruption do not necessarily mean that their staff are involved in bribery schemes. It is the first time the MoD has topped all three indices of the EACC baseline survey on ethics and corruption - the likelihood of a bribery demand, prevalence of bribery and impact on bribery. The ministry is often opaque, especially on matters touching on procurement of what is regarded to be sensitive hardware that  that may have implications for national security. According to the EACC report, bribery during recruitment involves amounts ranging from Sh50,000 to Sh250,000 to get accepted into the military training school at Moi Barracks in Eldoret. The report shows that at least 50 per cent of Kenyans have been asked, directly or indirectly, for a bribe whenever they have come into contact with MoD officers. According to EACC spokesman Yasin Amaro, the perception survey captures the recruitment of soldiers and procurement processes at the Ministry of Defence as the major avenues for corruption. ""Most respondents said that they have either bribed or been asked for a bribe to access services while in contact with MoD officers,"" he said. The EACC uses baseline surveys to flag problem institutions. This is followed up with a detailed thematic study based on findings of the baseline survey to narrow in  on the sector or institution that has been flagged for corruption. ""The next step will be to identify departments in order to carry out in-depth studies. In the meantime, the Preventive, Education, Training & Public Awareness, Ethics & Leadership and Investigations departments will draw up intervention strategies and schedules,"" Mr Yasin said. But MoD spokesman Bogita Ongeri argues that the report does not mean MoD officers were directly involved in corruption. ""EACC cannot rank us the most corrupt institution when they know we have prevention measures in place. We have streamlined the procurement processes, which previous surveys pointed out some years back,"" he said. He claimed cartels outside the ministry were responsible for the widespread bribery. ""We have addressed this issue before in press conferences before the recruitment processes. We have done our best to sensitise Kenyans--youth and their parents--so they are not misled by the cartels,"" Mr Ongeri said A recent case of fraud in the recruitment of soldiers involved a city engineer who paid Sh400,000 to individuals to admit two of his children to military school. However, the individuals turned out to be con men, and the money was intercepted by military intelligence personnel before the individuals were arrested and charged in court. Mr Ongeri said that during the last recruitment, close to Sh7 million was paid out to the cartels that operate outside MoD. ""These cartels hand out fake admission letters to young people who present them to military schools. The perception that such cartels represent uniformed officers is untrue. When recruitment starts, they open parallel recruitment centres and collect money from unsuspecting Kenyans."" A senior military officer who spoke to the Sunday Nation on condition of anonymity said   some even had an M-Pesa account which they used to defraud Kenyans before it was shut down. ""We are now compiling a list of people who have been conned by these cartels. We will release it to the public when we are done,"" said the officer. The provincial administration is ranked second in bribery prevalence."205,Daily Nation (Kenya),12/2/2013,URP leaders accuse allies of corruption,,NETHERLANDS (79%),1144,Newspaper,TIMOTHY KEMEI -1,ENGLISH,,1-Dec-13,,376  words,LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); POLITICAL PARTIES (90%); APPROVALS (90%); CORRUPTION (74%); CONSTRUCTION COSTS (71%); RAILROAD CONSTRUCTION (70%); MASS TRANSIT CONSTRUCTION (70%),"The MPs allied to United Republican Party (URP) said the high ranking government officials wield massive influence and make decisions without the approval of President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto.

In an email sent to senior CBK staff, Prof Ndung'u said the contract award was above board and appeared to accuse the institution's tender committee of sabotage by rooting for losing bidders. He said the crux of the matter was a tussle pitting CBK's tender team against the evaluation committee. Prof Ndung'u said Horsebridge Networks Systems East Africa Limited-which won the tender-was the lowest evaluated bidder and that he would not seek to reverse the decision. The tender dispute went to the Public Procurement and Oversight Authority (PPOA) which awarded the contract to Horsebridge as the ""lowest evaluated bidder"", he said. ""A reading of the two decisions made by the PPOA tribunal clearly shows that the tussle is between the bank evaluation and tender committees,"" the CBK governor said. ""The tender committee ordered the inclusion of two bidders who had been disqualified by the evaluation committee. The two bidders failed even after re-evaluation,"" he said, noting that PPOA faulted the tender committee's orders. Prof Ndung'u has come under pressure to challenge PPOA's decision to award the tender to Horsebridge in court but he says the legal opinion on which this pressure is founded has not captured all the tender's intrigues. ""An opinion was written. But we knew someone was going to try and change that opinion. So we waited. Just like night follows the day, the opinion changed. This I will deal with administratively,"" he said without naming the saboteurs. He said that crucial information was withheld by CBK staff during the first PPOA hearing including the fact that the tender had been terminated on September 26. Minutes were also presented showing that CBK signed a declaration that the tender was not terminated, dealing a blow to credibility of the bank's records. Meanwhile, Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission spokesman Yasin Amaro Tuesday said that they had received the file from the Director of Public Prosecutions office, with the consent to prosecute. Mr Amaro said that the governor would appear in court over abuse of office arising from the award of tender of security software.

Under the then President Daniel Moi's rule, governance standards had fallen to the gutter with corruption becoming such a way of life that reaction to revelations of multi-million-shilling scandals was more likely to be a sigh of resignation rather than shock or outrage. Sycophancy and the attendant court poetry were richly rewarding careers while cronyism and tribalism were preferred to meritocracy in public appointments. Worse still, the difference between the public and private purse was blurred for some powerful individuals. The rot meant that there were few game-changing development projects to talk of beyond the usual public relations stunts. No wonder some quipped that the administration of President Mwai Kibaki that was taking over had a low hurdle to jump to succeed. But the ""Narc dream"" failed and the subsequent contentious election in 2007 that ushered in the Grand Coalition Government was no better. Admittedly, the political changes allowed the strengthening of institutions, the unveiling of mega development projects, and a new Constitution in 2010. Nonetheless, the intractable problems of the Moi era - ethnicity, cronyism and corruption - were never fully tackled. Indeed, it may even be argued that these ""primitive"" problems in a ""progressive"" Kenya only put on fancier clothes, became more sophisticated and were inherited by new benefactors. Last year, the Jubilee administration assumed office with a promise for a fresh start. The so-called ""digital government"" of President Uhuru Kenyatta has so far done a decent job. The highlights have been the appointment of a technocratic Cabinet as constitutionally prescribed and the initiation of massive infrastructure projects. With a majority in Parliament, which some have labelled the ""tyranny of numbers"", the government has not found it difficult to overcome legislative hurdles in implementing its agenda. Nonetheless, there are worrying signs that the Jubilee government is furthering the sins that past governments have been accused of. There have been allegations of corruption with perceptions that powerful individuals in the ruling coalition and their cronies are the beneficiaries. The proposed standard gauge railway, whose implementation the President seems to be bulldozing despite pertinent questions on the integrity of the procurement process and the cost, has particularly come under scrutiny. It is quite telling that the President and his Deputy have variously blamed brokers and corrupt networks for opposing the project. In short, corruption is thriving and there is little political will to fight it beyond the usual rhetoric. Public appointments have also been deemed as skewed and often used to pay ethnic or political debts. Once again, there is a perception that qualified individuals from groups not favoured by the political establishment have been locked out. We think it is important for the President to take deliberate steps to counter the perceptions of high-level corruption and ethnicity in his government. Anything less will either lead to protests such as the one last Thursday or a sinking feeling of dí©jíæ vu that will take Kenya back to the dark Nyayo days.

The county and national governments appear to be racing to outdo each other in the commissioning of new and ever-bigger development projects. The Standard Gauge Railway, the Konza and Machakos cities, laptops for school kids, ambulances and police vehicles, just to  name a few. These, we are told, will get us to the promised land of Vision 2030. Development would indeed be welcome. We all know that the country needs better infrastructure; that the education system is failing our children and needs to be overhauled; that we need to invest more in the capacity of our security forces to deter and arrest criminals; and to provide quality, affordable and universal health care to our population. These are the things we all want. However, successive kleptocracies have rent our national fabric and eaten away at our capacity to provide them. For half a century, the corruption of the regimes of Jomo Kenyatta, Daniel Moi, and Mwai Kibaki caused us to wander aimlessly in the desert of poverty during which time; we were constantly offered ever more grandiose promises of ""development."" It is this corruption that is singularly responsible for the fact that our children learn under trees or have to cross crocodile-infested waters to get to school. It is corruption that has denied us efficient health service and effective security agencies. It is corruption that has skewed our priorities, destroyed our infrastructure and created a society, to paraphrase the late JM Kariuki, a nation of 10 millionaires and 10 million beggars. Corruption today continues to be Kenya's enemy number one. Yet it is not an enemy we are always comfortable acknowledging. The disappointment of the last 50 years has left many desperate for any hint of progress. It is this desperation that many in power, both at the national and county level, have been preying on. So they continue to offer ill-thought out and, often, questionably procured high visibility projects, which demonstrate little regard for either the law or the real interests of the people. It is perhaps understandable that some are tempted to look the other way when confronted with evidence of rules being bent or broken. Some may reason that we are at least getting something for our money, no matter how much else is stolen or squandered away. But this is a dangerous attitude. We cannot hope to build our country on the sands of questionable policies, irregular procurement, illegal payments and underhand deals. It is this state of affairs that has led to, in the words of some wags on Twitter, ""ambulances for a county with no hospitals, and laptops for schools without electricity."" The fact is corruption is a cancer on society. If diagnosed early and eliminated, then the country can develop and grow. However, if left unchecked, it will spread and eventually consume the nation. The values espoused in the 2010 constitution are the rock on which we should build our country anew. But what we have seen recently are signs of the return of grand corruption. At the national level, from the ""Hustler Jet"" to the Standard Gauge Railway, the Jubilee government has been beset by scandal. It is less than transparent in its conception and tendering for its grandiose schemes, many of which appear designed to further enrich a few individuals at the expense of the nation. At the county level, a recently released report from the Auditor-General has also revealed many to be dens of corruption, with rampant misappropriation of public funds. We must act quickly and decisively to excise this cancer from the new institutions created by the constitutions, before it metastasizes. We must all do our part to end the culture of impunity. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission should urgently investigate the instances of illegality in the acquisition on goods and services as well as in the awarding of contracts and the handling of public monies, at both the county and national level. All who are found culpable should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. County assemblies should also hold their executives to account. In the Senate, we are studying the Auditor-General's report and will be taking appropriate action in line with our constitutional duty. Within the CORD coalition, we are determined that the spectre of grand corruption will not be allowed to again haunt the country. We will continue to reach out across the party lines to find like-minded partners and so strengthen the legislature to act as an effective check on Executive excesses. As the saying goes, a house divided against itself cannot stand. Finally, we must find ways to mobilise the great multitude of our people to stand against corruption. We will partner with the progressive elements within the media, civil society and the religious fraternity to strengthen governance and oversight mechanisms and to educate and sensitise citizens on the dangers of graft at every level. So yes, corruption does matter. Accountability and transparency do matter. These are more than mere slogans but are the fundamental building blocks for lasting peace and prosperity in our land.

The educated elite is wholly responsible for the carnivorous greed, moral putrefaction and intellectual mediocrity into which Kenya has steadily sunk ever since independence. I say ""class"" because, before the last General Election, the scions of my class managed to sell to the incorrigibly gullible people of Kenya the dangerously false idea that age-grouping - not looting and yawning gaps of wealth - was our country's number one problem. We were told that, if efficiency had taken a nosedive, if corruption festered, if tribalism had intensified, if mass poverty was abysmal - all this was because ""oldies"" had clung to the instruments of power for too long. The only solution, we were assured, was to ""empower"" the youth. And it was a hit. As a result, my son's age is now the average age of our parliamentarians, senators, governors, top civil servants, parastatal chiefs, cabinet secretaries. From a certain viewpoint, this is not a bad thing. A society should grow stronger and haler by perpetually rejuvenating the blood of its rulers. But that depends on how qualitative the younger blood is. Can moral, social and intellectual quality be measured by chronological age alone? Of course, not. One thing is certain.  If the outgoing generation had any wisdom, skills and savoir faire, it would have acquired them only through long experience on the job. That is why these tools can be passed on effectively to the younger generation only by means of a deliberate, gentle, steady and hand-managed flow of succession. If it becomes a spate - if, one morning, the youth simply descend upon society like the Niagara - there can be no time or desire to hand over to them willingly and smoothly. There would be no occasion to ensure quality among the heirs. We can gauge this statement by asking the question: Have grabbing, tribalism, inefficiency, and so on, taken even a dent ever since a squad of very young men and women took over from Mwai Kibaki's old codgers in Parliament, the Ministry and the parastatals? If scandal is the single most important word about the acquisition of laptops for our children, the question is: What is new? If the taxpayer is asking a string of embarrassing questions about tendering for a newly proposed railway system, the only comment we can make is: Dí©jíæ vu. (READ: Kaimenyi ducks key queries on laptops) The question is: How do these activities of our younger men and women differ from such activities of their fathers as Kenren, the All-Africa Games rip-off, Goldenberg, Anglo-Leasing? In one of his poems to Lucy, William Wordsworth has long ago answered that question for us: ""The son is father of the man""! In one of his laugh-a-minute skits, our own Okot p'Bitek has once summarised the alliance between tribalism and graft by corrupting an old English epigram: ""Birds of a father flock to gather"". What Okot is saying (in Song of Lawino) is that a ""python"" of greed (namely, my class) - and not merely a certain generation of it - is what has swallowed Kenya's MPs and other leaders. That is the reductio  ad  absurdum  to those who seek to divert our attention away by claiming that this greed is the property of a certain tribe - the Kikuyu - and that only a certain generation - ""the youth"" - can redeem us from it.  Yet newspaper headlines show us daily that this HIV belongs to my entire class, not to any tribe or generation of it. Clearly, the only answer is a systematic national attack - by sharper educational weapons and more severe punitive sanctions - on the mentality and activities of my whole class (on octogenarians, teenagers, MPs, lawyers and other professions alike).

When the news spreads that a relative has died, Kenyans in urban areas will normally gather together to raise some money for funeral arrangements. Despite the frequency with which such harambees are held, I have never heard of a single occasion where relatives complained that the money had been misallocated. Generally, the family that receives the funds will do their best to run a smooth programme. They will often stretch their own resources to buy a bull or whatever so there can be no murmurs that the dead have not been sent off in the correct fashion. Turn this situation around and you hear that the chief has called a harambee to fence the local school or that the local factory needs to raise some money to grade the road because of heavy rains. The moment people hear about such an arrangement, the murmuring begins. This is another scheme to steal from us, people will mutter. Even if they turn up to the fund raiser, they will certainly not give joyfully. They may chip in Sh50 or Sh100 to keep up appearances, but the zeal and enthusiasm with which they take part in arrangements for the funeral of a friend, the school fees fundraiser of a relative or neighbour, or even the wedding of a colleague will be noticeable for its absence. To my mind, the difference in the approach to these two issues is useful to understanding why runaway corruption thrives in the public service in Africa. It is certainly not that corruption is innate to Africans. Graft is a global phenomenon. Yet what we face in Kenya is a crisis where to receive any form of service from the typical government official or to be awarded a tender, one is expected to offer some 'tea'. Ordinary wananchi don't encounter that in properly functioning societies like, say, Singapore.  But why is it that we don't steal money for a wedding but will loot the last coin set aside to build a road in the village? The Nigerian scholar Peter Ekeh offers an interesting answer. He argues that in the West, the way politics evolved was as a public activity that looks after the collective interests of the citizenry. What an individual cannot do on his own, such as build roads or maintain a police force, was surrendered to the political sphere. It was the same in Africa before colonialism when the public space--the political space--was occupied by elders and traditional chiefs and other figures of authority. But then suddenly, the colonial order introduced a 'second public'. This new 'public' was an enemy of the people. It was alien. It collected illegitimate taxes. It punished arbitrarily. In sum, it was not regulated by the same moral codes as the legitimate 'public' Africans had grown up knowing. When colonialism ended, Africans made no attempt to establish a link between the people and the government. Government remained a hostile entity that has no real attachment to the mwananchi. Growing up in the village, the other boys and I would run away when we spotted policemen at a distance for absolutely no reason. That's because to society, the government, i.e. the public service, is a threat to be feared, not a legitimate entity concerned with the public interest. This is the mind-set of public servants and elected officials who see 'public money' as nobody's money that is therefore fair game. It belongs to the 'government' not to the people. In Sweden or Japan, on the other hand, every single coin in the hands of a public official is seen as belonging to the society at large and something to be treasured and put to the right use. To eliminate corruption in Africa, we must rethink the African state. We must ask ourselves how to re-establish its legitimacy and get everyone to understand the link between taxation and delivery of public goods and why stealing public funds is the same as robbing a grandmother in Kangemi who pays a huge amount of tax on her jerrycan of paraffin.

MPs were accused of micromanaging parastatals, some on the basis of financial interests, while Deputy Minority Leader Jakoyo Midiwo spoke of 'rent-seeking' by his colleagues. Mr Midiwo said some committee chairmen have demanded that cabinet secretaries give them office space in their ministries. ""I spoke here last week about the issue of rent-seeking because it is out there,"" said Mr Midiwo. ""All these clashes are not because of any lacuna in the Constitution or the Standing Orders. It is because of the value of that investigation, which members don't know. That value is what we must speak about,"" said Mr Midiwo. The infighting between committees first broke out in January when the Public Investments and the Transport committees locked horns over which one of them should investigate the Sh327-billion contract for the construction of the standard-gauge railway. Majority Leader Aden Duale claimed that some committee chairmen have offices in ministriesŒæ and have taken to playing the role of ministers, even  reading speeches on behalf of cabinet secretaries. Mr Duale asked the Speaker to ""rein in chairmen who have not understood their roles as the leadership of committees"" and their relationship with the Executive. Transport Committee chairman Maina Kamanda said sometimes, Œæsummons to ministers are issued because of personal interests. National Security and Administration Committee head Asman Kamama admitted that there is confusion and duplication of roles in the National Assembly because of the numerous cases where two committees separately investigate one issue."215,Daily Nation (Kenya),4/12/2014,"Act on corruption now, 18 envoys challenge Uhuru",,KENYA (98%); UNITED STATES (93%); CANADA (93%); EUROPE (92%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (90%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%); SOMALIA (79%); GERMANY (72%),1144,Newspaper,"Mike Owuor, Associate Editor @MikeOwuor mowuor@ke.nationmedia.com -1",ENGLISH,,12-Apr-14,"NAIROBI, KENYA (88%)",1363  words,TERRORISM (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); TERRORIST ATTACKS (90%); DIPLOMATIC SERVICES (90%); COUNTIES (89%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (89%); EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (78%); COUNTERTERRORISM (77%); EUROPEAN UNION (76%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (73%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (70%); BOMBS & EXPLOSIVE DEVICES (69%); ALLIANCES & PARTNERSHIPS (57%),"Top Western diplomats and donors in Nairobi have issued a bold warning to the Jubilee government that failure to tackle corruption is ""undermining Kenya's future"". A statement sent to the Sunday Nation and signed by 18 chiefs of mission that represent Kenya's biggest multilateral partners - including the American, British, German, Japanese, Canadian, European Union and International Monetary Fund representatives - makes it clear that President Uhuru Kenyatta should take more robust steps to fight corruption at national and county levels. ""At the moment when Kenya is restructuring government through the devolution process, attracting investment, expanding trade, creating jobs, and fighting terrorism, corruption is holding the country back.Œæ It is an unwelcome companion, and has no place in Kenya's bright future,"" reads the statement and calls for ""strong commitment"" and genuine political will from the government. And in the face of recent terrorist attacks and increasing security threats, the diplomats and donors offer assistance to tackle the challenges but also note a link between corruption and insecurity. ""The best way to combat terrorism is to have well-trained and honest security forces committed to serving justice through established legal means.ŒæSecurity officers must be beyond reproach, impervious to bribes, always seeking to help people,"" says the statement. Suspected terrorists thought to be affiliated to the Somalia-based Al-Shabaab have in recent weeks carried out deadly attacks - killing six people when gunmen stormed a church in Likoni, Mombasa, on March 23 and six others when two explosive devices were lobbed in crowded areas in Nairobi's Eastleigh on April 1. These come six months after the Westgate Mall siege where terrorists killed 67 people. Last weekend, US ambassador Robert Godec and High Commissioners Christian Turner (United Kingdom), Geoffrey Tooth (Australia) and David Angell (Canada) met President Kenyatta at State House and pledged to support Kenya in the fight against terrorism. It was a rare meeting because the Jubilee administration has in the last one year exhibited a lukewarm relationship with Western diplomats. In the backdrop of a tough first year for the nascent county governments, including incriminating reports by the Auditor General, and what commentators have cynically described as the ""devolution of corruption"", the diplomats' statement presented as an opinion write-up, calls for financial accountability. ""The 47 counties should also work to establish a fair, transparent, and accountable devolved governance system with strong institutions and checks and balances to prevent corruption from taking root,"" the chiefs of mission say. The carefully crafted statement that combines feeble slaps with gentle strokes while retaining sterilised diplomatic language, also expresses the willingness of the international partners to continue supporting the Jubilee government in tackling corruption and insecurity. ""As partners, we stand ready to continue helping Kenya put in place the systems, processes, and procedures needed to make progress in the fight against corruption,"" they say. To effectively fight corruption in the long-term, the chiefs of mission suggest strengthened governance and transparency, strong democratic institutions, enforcement of anti-corruption laws, resolving past corruption cases, assets recovery, and creating a conducive and predictable business environment. They also insist that the government should fight ""the impunity for corruption irrespective of the social and political status of someone suspected of having committed a crime"". Applaud president In an apparent effort to express a sense of balance, the chiefs of mission applaud the President's commitment to tackling corruption, citing his State of the Nation address to Parliament last month where he acknowledged the problem and committed to take on corruption head-on, including in his office. But critics, including the Opposition Cord coalition, have been keen to point out the gap between the Jubilee administration's public statements against corruption and the supposed failure to act. For example, the government has been fighting off allegations that the tendering of the multi-billion-shillings Standard Gauge Railway to be built mainly by a Chinese loan and contractors was overpriced and opaque to cater for corrupt interests. Parliament's Public Investment Committee chaired by Aldas MP Adan Keynan is investigating the deal while the Transport Committee led by Starehe MP Maina Kamanda gave it a clean bill of health. The flagship Sh24.6 billion project to provide laptops to Standard One pupils has also been halted, and is the subject of a court case over a tendering dispute, with hints of vicious behind-the-scenes fights pitting various corrupt political and business interests. India's Olive Telecommunications had initially won the tender to supply 1.2 million laptops before the Public Procurement Administrative Review Board reversed the deal following complaints filed by Chinese firm Haier and American technology giant Hewlett-Packard. But in a hard-hitting rejoinder to the envoys, the Director of Public Communication at State House, Mr Munyori Buku, told the Sunday Nation the ""foreign junior officers"" should keep their opinion to themselves or use the right channels to air them.""They must start to learn that the world has shifted and nobody really cares about what they think. They can neither take us to heaven nor deliver us from hell,"" said Mr Buku. He emphasised that the government had acknowledged the existence of corruption and was fighting it even without the diplomatic ""preaching"". President Kenyatta's government has had a difficult relationship with Western diplomats, mostly hinged on ongoing cases at the International Criminal Court (ICC). The President, his deputy William Ruto and journalist Joshua arap Sang are facing charges related to the 2007/2008 post-election violence. Their supporters believe the cases, which started before they were elected last year, as being pushed by the West at the behest of local political opponents. In the run-up to the March 4 elections, last year, the Jubilee Alliance accused Western diplomats of attempting to influence the outcome of the elections in favour of the rival Cord and its presidential candidate Raila Odinga. The criticism intensified after then US assistant secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson pointedly warned Kenyans that they risked diplomatic isolation if they voted in Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto before the ICC cases were concluded. Mr Carson's famous ""choices have consequences"" warning lent itself as a campaign slogan with Jubilee leaders using it to rally its supporters against perceived neocolonialism while Cord cautioned voters against the risk of turning Kenya into a pariah state by electing ICC suspects. The UK High Commissioner to Kenya Christian Turner ratcheted up the diplomatic hardball when he warned that his country would only have ""essential contact"" with the Jubilee duo if they were elected. After its electoral victory, the Jubilee administration has ill-disguised its disdain for the West and strengthened trade and diplomatic ties with China. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is expected in Nairobi next month on his African tour, becoming the first top leader from the world's biggest economic powers to visit the country. The Chinese mission to Kenya is conspicuous in its absence from the statement by the chiefs of mission released to the Sunday Nation. No African country also appears among the 18 signatories while Japan is the only Asian nation to endorse the anti-corruption message. But the guarded language used is different from previous statements from Western diplomats, especially during the Daniel Moi and Mwai Kibaki presidencies. For example, in a scorching speech on corruption in 2004, less than two years after the starry-eyed Narc administration took over, the then British High Commissioner to Kenya Edward Clay expressed the frustrations of donors and diplomats against the new government's rampant corruption, saying the corrupt in government ""eat like gluttons""."216,Daily Nation (Kenya),4/22/2014,EDITORIAL: Corruption to blame for Kenya's insecurity,,KENYA (92%),1144,Newspaper,Editorial -1,ENGLISH,,22-Apr-14,,307  words,ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS (93%); IMMIGRATION (92%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); BORDER CONTROL (78%); PASSPORTS & VISAS (78%); NATIONAL SECURITY (78%); IDENTITY SECURITY (78%); NATIONAL IDENTITY CARDS (78%); CITIZENSHIP (71%); TERRORISM (53%); TERRORIST ATTACKS (53%),"It does not make sense to weed out illegal immigrants when the supply chain is left intact. The ongoing crackdown on illegal immigrants aimed at enforcing security has gone some way towards ridding the country of unwanted characters and must be intensified to the logical conclusion. However, that is just part of a solution to a far bigger problem. As we reported yesterday, the greatest threat to our security is corruption that has made it too easy for foreigners to penetrate our borders, quickly acquire citizenship complete with birth certificates, national identity cards and passports,Œæand then engage in all sorts of nefarious activities. A close-knit cartel comprising brokers, officials in the departments of immigration and registrar of persons, the police and the administration, has perfected a corrupt system of transporting, registering and legitimising illegal immigrants, hence exposing the country to grave security risks. It is common knowledge that the terror attacks and other forms of insecurity did not begin spontaneously. They are a summation of a series of premeditated lapses induced by government officials with a get-rich-quick mentality. Thus the fight against insecurity must begin by tackling its root cause - weeding out those crooks in government who sell identification documents - while aggressively pursuing and punishing the brokers who negotiate the deals. It does not make sense to conduct swoops and weed out illegal immigrants when the supply chain is left intact. Even those flushed out will come back because the networks remain active and vibrant. The leadership must carry out a thorough shakeup of the departments of Immigration and Registration of Persons, shuffle border police and the administration and investigate and prosecute those involved in activities that compromise our  national security."217,Daily Nation (Kenya),4/22/2014,Poaching fueled by corruption: Study,,"AFRICA (95%); KENYA (95%); SUDAN (92%); UNITED STATES (92%); CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE (79%); CENTRAL AFRICA (79%)",1144,Newspaper,JAMES KARIUKI -1,ENGLISH,,22-Apr-14,,828  words,ANIMAL POACHING & TRAFFICKING (91%); CORRUPTION (91%); WILDLIFE (91%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); MAMMALS (90%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (90%); LOBBYING (90%); PARAMILITARY & MILITIA (89%); ETHNIC CONFLICTS (78%); NATIONAL PARKS (78%); WAR & CONFLICT (77%); INTERVIEWS (75%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (73%); CONFLICT MINERALS (70%); EXECUTIVES (70%); DIAMOND MARKETS (64%); FINES & PENALTIES (62%); GENOCIDE (50%),"A global wildlife protection lobby group has blamed corruption for increased poaching in Kenya and other African countries. A global wildlife protection lobby group has accused Kenya and other African countries of condoning corruption within its ranks leading to the raging poaching menace. Born Free USA's newly commissioned study claimed that corrupt government officials allowed militia from criminal networks to use locally sourced weapons in killing elephants and rhinos for their highly priced tusks and horns said to be sold in the underworld Sh86 billion market. The organisation's chief executive officer Adam Roberts Tuesday called for renewed global efforts to address poaching. He called for banning of  known markets and governments pressurised to fire corrupt officials who provide poachers and game trophy dealers with a conducive environment to operate. ""The elephant poaching crisis has reached historic levels and shockingly, some elephant populations face extinction in my lifetime,"" he said. The report dubbed ""Ivory's Curse: The Militarization and Professionalization of Poaching in Africa"" says that poachers in Kenya enjoy 'official' protection where they are provided with weapons to kill elephants with Mombasa's Kilindini port being the main transit point. The report prepared by C4ADS, a non-profit organization dedicated reporting of conflict and security issues worldwide, calls for political goodwill from world leaders where all security apparatus are fully engaged in the anti-poaching war to stop poaching across Africa. The report asserts that organised crime, government corruption and militia are linked to elephant poaching and ivory trade. In an earlier interview, Wildlife and Forestry Cabinet Minister Professor Judy Wakhungu reiterated the government's commitment to wiping out poachers with the Kenya Wildlife Service boss William Kiprono saying there were no sacred cows in the anti-poaching war. The two senior government officials said there was political goodwill in the anti-poaching war as evidenced by new laws that introduced stiff penalties on anyone dealing with game trophies. Since the beginning of the year, 51 elephants and 11 rhinos have been killed. There is a notable increase in rhino poaching at Lake Nakuru National park where six rhinos have been killed by poachers armed with high-calibre rifles. Kenya lost 59 rhinos and 302 elephants in 2013 compared to 2012 whereby 384 elephants and 30 rhinos were killed for their valuable tusks and horns. C4ADS Senior Analyst Varun Vira said: ""Ivory is a conflict, crime, and corruption issue with severe human impact. It has been a conflict resource for decades, just like blood diamonds or coltan in Central Africa, only without the same level of global attention."" ""From Sudan, government-allied militias complicit in the Darfur genocide fund their operations by poaching elephants hundreds of miles outside North Sudan's borders while in the Democratic Republic of Congo, state security forces patronize the very rebels they are supposed to fight, providing them with weapons and support in exchange for ivory,"" the report states. In Zimbabwe, it says political elites, including those under international sanction are seizing wildlife spaces that either are or likely will soon be used as covers for poaching operations. Kenya, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Tanzania and Sudan are the hardest hit  according to the study that added: ""where poachers move across borders with near impunity, slaughter elephants with complete disregard and use the ivory to fund violent operations across the continent. Global leaders cannot stand by while the human tragedy and poaching crisis continue."" In Mozambique, the report says, organised crime has been militarised and consolidated to an that it has dared to cross over into South Africa in search of the precious rhino horns without fear of the well-endowed army and well-trained rangers while In Gabon and the Republic of Congo, ill-regulated forest exploitation is bringing East Asian migrant labourers into contact with Central Africa's last elephants. The report also accused the Tanzania's political elites of aiding the industrial-scale depletion of East Africa's largest elephant population. ""Subsistence elephant poaching barely exists anymore since impoverished locals may pull the triggers but they have resulted to organized crime, which controls the scale of the poaching and nearly all profits. Saving both elephants and local communities will require moving from the bush into the world of global illicit networks in order to target transnational criminal profits,"" says Vira who adding that there were more young people willing to risk their lives to kill elephants for a shilling. One elephant yields about 20 pounds of ivory worth approximately Sh2.58 million($30,000). The handsome returns received by poachers could fuel poaching as scarcity of ivory and rhino horns will likely increase with the escalating retail price of ivory."218,Daily Nation (Kenya),4/22/2014,How corruption paves the way for illegal aliens,,KENYA (95%); SOMALIA (94%); ETHIOPIA (93%); ERITREA (79%),1144,Newspaper,SAMWEL BORN MAINA -1,ENGLISH,,21-Apr-14,"NAIROBI, KENYA (58%)",944  words,IMMIGRATION (95%); POLICE FORCES (91%); ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); ARRESTS (89%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (79%); PASSPORTS & VISAS (78%); TERRITORIAL & NATIONAL BORDERS (78%); CITY GOVERNMENT (78%); DEPORTATION (78%); BORDER CONTROL (76%); TRAVELER SAFETY & SECURITY (65%); TERRORISM (56%),"Corruption in the Immigration Department and police service has made it easy for foreigners to enter Kenya and secure ID cards in a matter of weeks. Corruption in the Immigration Department and police service has made it easy for foreigners to enter Kenya and secure ID cards in a matter of weeks, Nation has established. In the midst of growing terrorism threats and the resultant crackdown on illegal immigrants, the Nation traced the underground routes through which foreigners enter the country and secure key identification documents with the connivance of corrupt officials in departments clustered under the Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government. At the core of the racket are brokers known as 'mukallas' by immigrants who operate with utmost secrecy, thriving in jargon and masterminding specific routes. The immigrants are mainly from Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Sudan, who sneak in through porous borders and make their way by road to the Isiolo town where they begin the process of securing ID cards and passports. Thereafter, they make their way to Nairobi or other places of their choice. Mr Ibrahim Hassan, the officer in charge of Prisons in Isiolo, where those unfortunate enough to be caught are held for deportation, said the dream to gain entry into Kenya is overwhelming for the foreigners. ""Coming to Kenya, for them, is like the American dream. They sell everything they have to give brokers the money who sneak them into the country,"" he says. Mr Hassan says fining the immigrants is a waste of time since most of them do not have any money with them. ""Because it is expensive to accommodate the high number, we recommend that they be deported as soon as they have been arrested,"" he says. The border town of Moyale, which lies on the North Corridor, is cited as the key point where foreigners from Ethiopia and Somalia converge before heading to Isiolo. Somali immigrants mainly enter Kenya through Mandera and then proceed to Moyale using local guides. From Moyale, they are able to navigate their way to Isiolo despite the highway between the two towns having having nearly a dozen security checks. The 'mukallas' have links to networks in the police who alert them about the security barriers. For instance, when a truck full of illegal immigrants is a kilometre away from a roadblock, the passengers are told to alight and walk through bushes, and then board the truck again past the checkpoint. ""We catch up with the truck a kilometre after the roadblock. All along we are led by someone who knows the terrain well,"" an immigrant who spoke in confidence to the Nation in Isiolo Town said. Mr George Naibei, the police chief at Archers Post in the outskirts of Isiolo, said most of the immigrants arrested are from Ethiopia. The Nation learnt it is difficult to arrest immigrants from Somalia because they are well-connected and well-oiled with money. This makes it easier for them to make their way through bribes.""We have arrested several, especially when the water levels at the Ewaso river are high, this makes it difficult for them to cross, so they have to use a vehicle,"" Mr Naibei says. Isiolo Town is their first port of call beacuse of its strategic location and ethnic mix, which akes it easy to melt into the local population. Investigations led the Nation team to a man only identified as ""Mr Harrison"", who had at the ready all the tools for processing identity cards. Mr Harrison has a camera for taking passport photos, a roller for taking finger prints, IDs' registration forms and a vehicle. Thr Nation team met a group of 15 beneficiaries of Harrison's services at Nairobi's  Eastleigh. They were not supposed to get out of the house until their IDs were ready. To reach Harrison on phone, one has to use a certain jargon.""When you are seeking his help you say, 'niko na mbuzi iko Kiamaiko, unaweza zinunua?' (I have goats at Kiamaiko, can you buy them?),"" says a middleman. After agreeing on the mode of payment, the immigrants revealed, Harrison takes a down payment and then embarks on making the IDs. ""He came into the house where we were waiting already armed with a camera, a roller and the forms,"" the source told the Nation. The immigrants readily paid the money and Harrison took their credentials and set off  for Isiolo. ""He told us the IDs would be ready in three weeks, he was paid Sh100,000 on the spot, he is known to deliver, so we had no reason to doubt him,"" the source revealed. In Isiolo, Nation learnt, Mr Harrison goes into the interior, where he convinces poor peasants parents to provide their IDs and accept and pose as parents of the applicants in exchange of between Sh1,000 and Sh2,000. Mr Hassan Hokicha, a chief in Isiolo admits it is difficult to prove that the applicant is fake. ""We normally tell applicants to bring their birth certificates to prove they are from this area, but sometimes they say they have attained the age of getting an ID and they do not have any education, so do we turn them away yet the parents have said the applicants are their sons or daughters,"" he says. Mr Harrison then forwards the forms to the registrar of persons office in Isiolo using his contact inside. The forms are brought to Nairobi for processing like all normal applications. After three weeks, the genuine Kenyan IDs are ready for collection. Harrison brings them to the owners, who now become citizens of the country from Isiolo County, gets his cut and goes back to Isiolo to wait for another deal. With the ongoing police swoop in the country, we were told, Mr Harrison is lying low. By the time of going to press, we had forwarded all the details of Harrison to the CID and Immigration Department."219,Daily Nation (Kenya),5/3/2014,OTIENO: Fight against corruption in Kenya is not irredeemable,,KENYA (74%),1144,Newspaper,Otieno Otieno -1,ENGLISH,,3-May-14,,30  words,CORRUPTION (86%),"  As biblical stories go, the ones about redemption - where just about everyone seems to have a second chance to avoid certain destruction or become an unlikely hero - are my favourite."220,Daily Nation (Kenya),8/26/2014,Women decry corruption in award of govt tenders,,KENYA (74%),1144,Newspaper,REBECCA OKWANY -1,ENGLISH,,26-Aug-14,,474  words,WOMEN (91%); CORRUPTION (90%); CONTRACT AWARDS (90%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (90%); BANKING & FINANCE (89%); CARTELS (89%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%),"Women leaders from Mombasa County have said cartels are preventing women groups from getting government tenders. Women leaders from Mombasa County have asked Deputy President William Ruto's wife Rachel to assist them in containing cartels that they say control government tenders if they want women to benefit from table banking.  Mombasa County women representative Mishi Mboko said that many registered women groups have been unsuccessfully trying to get government tenders because of corrupt procurement officers who award tenders to their preferred people. Her remarks came a few hours after Mrs Rachael Ruto and experts from her office trained women on the table banking concept and the benefits of being in a registered group especially when seeking government tenders. ""I have received reports and even tried to intervene for very many registered women groups in getting tenders but because of these cartels they get nothing. ""Even the simplest of tenders such as cleaning, sweeping are given to people who are already rich,"" Ms Mboko said during the training at government training institute in Mombasa. URGED TO INTERVENE She appealed to Mrs Ruto to intervene in addressing the problem of cartels so that women groups can benefit from government tenders. She added that most of the companies that are awarded the tenders end up receiving the same or more tenders repeatedly under 'different names' supported by their corrupt procurement officers. Mrs Ruto advised women to keep their meeting places and individual plans secret to avoid attracting thieves who may target to rob them of their savings and work hard in their investments. She also warned women to avoid group projects which largely fail due to inactive and defaulting participants and instead use the loans they get from table banking to invest in personal businesses. Mombasa County Governor Hassan Joho who addressed the meeting before leaving to attend to other matters promised to support women groups which are focused on investment. TABLE BANKING CONCEPT Earlier, Senior Programmes Officer at Mrs Ruto's office and table banking guru Abraham Kipkemei taught women how the concept works and the requirements needed to run a successful table banking group. ""Your group must be registered with the Ministry of Gender and Social Services and must have a minimum of 15 to 35 members,"" said Mr Kipkemei. He had advised women to quickly form groups noting that the government easily gives priority to groups in table banking access to loans and tenders as they are able to prove they are disciplined and reliable in investments and repaying loans.  Mombasa is the 34th county so far to benefit from knowledge on table banking. The day-long meeting also saw table banking ward trainers being issued with certificates for their training which was conducted days earlier at Shanzu."221,Daily Nation (Kenya),9/30/2014,Court suspends Malema trial over corruption,,SOUTH AFRICA (94%),1144,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,30-Sep-14,,468  words,CORRUPTION (93%); POLITICS (89%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (78%); CONSPIRACY (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (78%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (75%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (75%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (75%); MONEY LAUNDERING (73%); RURAL COMMUNITIES (60%); INFRASTRUCTURE (50%); CONSTRUCTION (50%),"A South African court Tuesday suspended the corruption trial of firebrand politician Julius Malema, pushing the high-profile case against the self-appointed graft buster back by nearly a year. POLOKWANE, Tuesday A South African court Tuesday suspended the corruption trial of firebrand politician Julius Malema, pushing the high-profile case against the self-appointed graft buster back by nearly a year. Mr Malema, who heads the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters, faces charges of fraud, corruption, money-laundering and racketeering linked to a $5 million government contract won five years ago. The 33-year-old, who won fame railing against graft in South African politics, insists the charges are part of ""persecution"" by his former allies, now foes, in the ruling African National Congress (ANC). A sea of some 500 supporters, chanting ""hands off our commander-in-chief"", rallied outside the courthouse in the northern city of Polokwane, where police had erected razor wire barricades to keep them at a distance. ""You have covered our backs,"" Mr Malema told his followers after leaving court, dressed in a dark grey suit, white shirt and red tie. ""The masses are never wrong, the masses can see through conspiracy, the masses can see persecution, the masses can see a political agenda that seeks to undermine the leadership of the revolution,"" he shouted to a roar of approval from the crowd. Mr Malema's supporters, many dressed in red berets and T-shirts and dancing to music in front of the tribunal, slammed the proceedings as politically motivated. ""The problem is that political influence has made him to be seen as if he has done corruption,"" said TJ Malatjie, an electrician. ""We do feel that he is innocent."" PAY BACK THE MONEY The trial, now scheduled to open on August 3, 2015 and expected to run for a month, brings into sharp -- and ironic -- focus the drive against graft in South African politics. Last month Mr Malema led chants of ""Pay Back the Money"" aimed at his political arch-foe President Jacob Zuma, plunging parliament into chaos. He wants Mr Zuma to cough up the $24 million of taxpayers' money spent on ""security upgrades"" at his private rural home. Mr Malema himself, along with four business associates, is accused of lying to win a public works construction contract in his home province of Limpopo, worth 52 million rand ($4.6 million, 3.6 million euros.) The proceeds are alleged to have been used to help buy Malema a luxury Mercedes Benz Viano and a large farm. If convicted, he could spend a maximum of 15 years and be asked to pay a large fine. He would also automatically lose his seat in parliament, where he is endlessly posing troublesome questions for Zuma.  A former ANC stalwart, Malema was booted out of the party for sowing indiscipline two years ago.

The report also says that weapons sent to the national army and supposed to be used to defend the internationally-backed government have been seen on open sale in at least one market where Al-Shabaab agents bought arms. Underlying corruption as a system of governance has not yet fundamentally changed and, in some cases, arguably has worsened,"" the new report by the UN Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea said. The UN Security Council last year allowed a partial lifting of an arms embargo on Somalia to allow the national army to rearm, but ""some of the weapons and ammunition have been diverted to arms markets in Mogadishu"", the report said. TACTICAL SHIFT Financially, the UN experts said they had ""consistently found patterns of misappropriation with diversion rates of between 70 and 80 per cent."" ""The indications are that diverted funds are used for partisan agendas that constitute threats to peace and security,"" said the 482-page confidential report, which was provided by a UN source. Around a third of revenues from the capital Mogadishu's busy seaport, a key source of income totalling millions of dollars for the internationally funded government, cannot be accounted for. Meanwhile the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Al-Shabaab have shifted tactics in the face of sustained military assaults by the 22,000-strong African Union force and repeated air strikes, including last month's assassination of insurgent commander Ahmed Abdi Godane. But air and drone strikes are doing little to damage the militia in the long term. ""Strategic strikes have in general resulted in short term gains but significantly failed to diminish Al-Shabaab's operation capacity,"" the report read. ""There is no current evidence that they have the potential to 'degrade and destroy' Al-Shabaab."" REGIONAL THREAT At home, the Al-Shabaab have increased their use of bombs including the ""noticeable"" introduction of magnetic vehicle bombs, a tactic previously more commonly used in Afghanistan and Iraq, and which ""may represent a transfer of battlefield knowledge to Somalia,"" it added. The report also says the Al-Shabaab, who carried out the September 2013 massacre in the Kenyan capital Nairobi's Westgate mall, continue to pose a regional threat.

President Uhuru Kenyatta has rejected the proposed amendments to the anti-corruption law. President Kenyatta, in a memorandum to Parliament, said the changes aimed at strengthening the Anti-Corruption and Economic Act, 2003, discriminated against certain public officers.  The changes contained in the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2014, were passed in August. ""The proposed changes promote discrimination against public officers with executive powers,"" the President's memo said. The changes require a State officer with executive responsibility charged with corruption or economic crime to be suspended, at half pay, with effect from the date of the charge until the conclusion of the case within 24 months. President Kenyatta wants the phrase ""executive responsibility"" deleted. ""This amendment can be construed to be discriminatory against public or State officers with executive responsibility in that it excludes other public offices with similar responsibilities,"" said President Kenyatta. He is also uncomfortable with a change to the Act  that would have seen public or State officers adversely mentioned in parliamentary reports suspended until after investigations, which, he said, is also discriminatory. ""A committee report is normally presented after investigations and any public or State officer mentioned  is subject to sub-section (1). This therefore renders this section unnecessary,"" said the President. REMOVAL OF SECRETARIES The MPs also want to get involved in the removal of secretaries of constitutional commissions accused of corruption. They proposed that affected commissions would submit petitions to Parliament for the removal of  secretaries, a proposal the President said went against Article 250 (2) of the Constitution that gives such commissions power to hire and fire secretaries. The President also rejected a proposal that would have seen some universities stopped from offering law degrees. The MPs defined a legal studies education provider as 'a post-secondary institution licensed to offer legal education or training for the award of a certificate, diploma or degree, except those granted a charter under section 19 of the Universities Act, 2012.""

This is welcome. It is hoped that he and the National Police Service Commission will go a step further by instituting a framework for the audit.  Senior police officers should also be included, if the leadership hopes to bring about any meaningful change in the police force. The vetting of senior police officers earlier this year demonstrated the need for such a lifestyle audit as it was evident that some of them had amassed unexplained and undeclared wealth. The police department has topped all Transparency International Kenya's bribery indices since 2001. Complaints of corruption in the National Police Service have not dissipated despite the various efforts at police reforms. The Public Officers Ethics Act requires all public officers and their families to declare their wealth by filing returns every two years. However, the law has encountered much resistance from public officers. The courts have stopped the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) from pursuing cases premised on unexplained wealth on the principle of protection against self-incrimination, reducing the wealth declaration system to a mere farce. Despite the challenges that wealth declaration and lifestyle audit have faced in Kenya, they are still the most widely used approaches to preventing and detecting illicit wealth and corruption. STRONG TOOL A well-defined asset declaration and lifestyle audit system is a strong tool to fight public sector corruption and abuse of power. The Inspector-General and the National Police Service Commission should work with the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to institute a legal process to verify public servants' wealth. We, at Transparency International Kenya, are ready to work with the National Police Service to ensure that the audit takes off as well as help the service to institute and strengthen an integrity system. Political leadership is critical for the success of such an initiative. We hope that other public entities will support lifestyle auditing as a means to detect and prevent corruption in the public service. The audit should be supported by a robust wealth declaration system to ensure routine and accurate asset disclosure. The President should task the relevant government agencies with supporting the EACC in establishing an elaborate and effective wealth declaration system. This system should generate baseline information against which future disclosures can be compared to identify illegitimate increase in wealth. Civil servants with genuine sources of wealth can be protected from suspicion and allegations of misconduct or abuse of office. Undeclared or unexplained wealth should also serve as a factor in deciding suitability for public office. Sanctions for non-compliance with declaration requirements must be severe. For this system to succeed, it has to enjoy maximum support from our leadership at the highest level. The writer is the Executive Director, Transparency International Kenya. (skimeu@tikenya@org).

When President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the Access to Government Procurement Opportunities (AGPO) programme a year ago, the excitement among business-minded women, youths, and the disabled was electric. The programme sets aside 30 per cent of all purchases of goods and services by the government and all public entities for businesses owned by women, the youth, and the disabled.  It is a potentially far-reaching and revolutionary initiative. Thousands of youths, women, and disabled people stand to become economically empowered. What is more, millions of jobs would be created, reducing the number of the idle and the incidence of crime and drug abuse. Sadly, this seems unlikely to happen. For many women, young people, and the disabled, the past year has been a bewildering journey of heartbreak and frustration. AGPO has turned out to be a cruel and sadistic mirage that has left them even poorer. The reason for this goes to the heart of what bedevils Kenya today: Corruption. While top officials at the Treasury and Devolution ministries -- AGPO's key policy-implementing agencies -- have given their all to make the programme a success, the same cannot be said of procurement officers on the ground. They seem to regard the programme as an infringement on their ""right to eat"", a mere distraction from their normal practice of looting public organisations. To these officers, AGPO is a nuisance. TIME-TESTED TRICKS To frustrate enterprises owned by women, the youth, and the disabled from rightfully accessing business, the officers employ several time-tested tricks. One common trick is the awarding of contracts that do not make any business sense. One leading parastatal in the energy sector, for example, is reported to have asked several disabled businesspeople to go in person to its headquarters, deep in Nairobi's Industrial Area, to collect a quotation for just five reams of A1 paper. One disabled-owned business, after a lengthy and resources-consuming quotation process, got an order to supply pens worth Sh6,000. Yet another parastatal wanted to be supplied with just 500 letterheads worth about Sh4,000. To appreciate just how frustrating this is, one must remember that in all public procurement, the invited businesspersons must first collect quotation forms from the procuring entity, canvass suppliers for the best prices, fill the quotation form and stamp it, return it in a sealed envelope to the procuring entity, and then wait to be told whether one has won the contract or not. If one is successful, one must collect the local purchase order, purchase and supply the goods and have delivery notes signed, deliver an invoice, then wait for payment. All that for business worth, say, Sh4,000. The time and resources one would have used will probably be in the range of Sh10,000 or more if one is wheelchair-bound. Another common trick is disqualifying a bidder on technicality. In one case, an elderly disabled contractor was disqualified from a major power-related tender because a lawyer had not certified one leaf in his tender documents of more than 50 pages. Another one was knocked out because his documents did not show his business's physical address despite the fact that his letterheads on the tender documents clearly had one. TRANSFERRED SHARES But perhaps the most devastating trick is the simplest. To qualify for the AGPO programme, a business must be registered with the Treasury. The main shareholder in the enterprise must be a woman, youth, or disabled person holding no less than 70 per cent of the shares. To get around this, corrupt officers and their cronies have simply transferred shares in their old companies to their wives, mistresses, and children, making them compliant with the law and therefore eligible for AGPO. The truly deserving people are being thrown the crumbs. To salvage AGPO and restore hope to those who were meant to benefit, the government must move fast to address these concerns. For this noble initiative to succeed, it must not be business as usual.

Kenya's election officials pocketed millions of shillings in bribes to award lucrative printing contracts to a UK company over a two-year period, prosecution documents filed in a London court show.  In a legal battle that has left in its wake one of the best documented cases of an international corruption network in Kenya's history, the UK prosecutors have filed in court loads of written evidence implicating senior election officials in the corruption ring, including Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) chairman Issack Hassan. Court documents show that the Kenyan taxpayer paid dearly for the illicit dealings between senior Smith & Ouzman (S&O) officials and the senior managers and commissioners in the defunct Interim Independent Electoral Commission (IIEC), putting to shame Kenyan prosecutors and the anti-corruption agency officials who have yet to nail anyone for the offences. ""The scale of the corruption alleged by the prosecution is worth Œ£349,057.39 (Sh50 million) in Kenya,"" the prosecutor Mark Bryant-Heron says in court filings. For many of the printing contracts, costs were inflated by up to 38 per cent mainly to cater for the kickbacks -- commonly referred to in the mails as 'chicken' -- to senior election officials, the UK prosecutors say. The prosecutors say ""the corrupt payments were built into S&O's pricing of the printed materials so that the inflation in the price as a result of that corruption was passed onto those funding the institutions that contracted with S&O.""  Forensic investigations by the UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) show that top IIEC officials, the predecessor of IEBC, variously asked for bribes codenamed 'chicken' to facilitate S&O's winning of seven tenders to supply election materials such as ballot papers, voter registration forms, voter ID cards and nomination forms. Energy Cabinet Secretary Davis Chirchir, who worked as a senior manager at the IIEC, tops the list of senior government officials named in the corruption racket.

Kenya's private sector has been listed among the world's most corrupt, presenting the Uhuru Kenyatta government with yet another daunting task to tackle in the quest to make East Africa's largest economy the region's preferred investment destination.  International audit firm Ernst and Young says in a report released on Thursday that one in every three Kenyan companies surveyed had paid bribes to win contracts. The survey conducted in 59 countries ranks Kenya behind Egypt, Nigeria and Namibia as economies where private sector corruption is most pervasive and distorting of tender award processes. More than a quarter or 27 per cent of the chief executives, financial controllers and internal auditors surveyed in Kenya cited high levels of fraud in their companies -- only lower than 44 per cent in Egypt, 30 per cent in Nigeria and 28 per cent in Namibia. E&Y says private sector bribery, fraud and corruption is mainly driven by middle-level managers, especially men aged between 35 and 45. ""Their actions are mainly driven by pressure to perform and achieve set targets,"" said Miriam Gaituri, the associate director at Ernst and Young. The study found that most recipients of bribes do not ask for it but act in a manner that signals their hands need to be greased. ""We found that when someone wants a bribe they delay services and so you feel you have to grease their hands for things to move faster,"" said Peter Kahi, a partner at the audit firm, adding that up to 90 per cent of the interviewees said they have never been asked for a bribe directly.

The other day we celebrated International Anti-Corruption Day and Transparency International released its annual corruption index. Kenya is now ranked 145 out of 175 countries and on a scale whereby 100 rates a country as very clean and zero ranks highly corrupt, Kenya scored 25 which confirms this is a pretty murky society.  Kenya shares places with illustrious names like Somalia, South Sudan and CAR -- all failed states. Horrid tales of corruption provide easy news for media houses but the scandals are so plentiful that you cannot keep up with them. That noble gentleman Edward Ouko released his annual report as Auditor General revealing that in the last audited year Sh300 billion disappeared or was unaccounted for; after that came the chicken licking story from IIEC whereby 36 per cent of all contracts with British printing company Smith & Ouzman remained in Kenya as kickbacks for the finger dipping commission. Round the same time the PAC revealed that Sh2.8 billion from the Office of the President disappeared during the 2013 Kibaki transition. Corruption is so pervasive that the nation suffers from graft fatigue; nothing surprises us or shocks us anymore. We are just exhausted and overwhelmed by it all. EASY COUNTRY FOR TERRORISTS But bear with me to relate that according to Global Financial Integrity (GFI) Kenya is the easiest country in the world for a criminal or terrorist to open an anonymous shell company to launder money. Between 2002-2011, $13.5 billion flowed illegally in or out of Kenya and that amounts to more than our total budget for 2014-15. GFI also claim that Kenya lost $700 million in 2012 as a result of smuggling, mainly in the sugar industry. That may well explain why Mumias Sugar posted a $26 million loss last year. What is more worrying still is the last Sunday Nation story that claimed that the smuggled sugar is funding the heinous crimes of Al-Shabaab. In other words, our corrupted society is funding terrorists to kill Kenyan citizens. So don't pretend that corruption does not impact on you and never accept the perverted notion that corruption is an alternative economy and is here to stay. Tolerance of such false notions fails to acknowledge that corruption endangers the morals of the entire country and the worst affected is Wanjiku, who remains in the shackles of poverty and insecurity. Corruption has now been devolved to the village: Church councils grant themselves contracts; NGOs do deals with suppliers; headteachers believe in their right to misuse FPE funds. INTEGRITY OF THE HOME I don't subscribe to the slogan: security starts with you and me, but I do believe that fighting corruption includes the two of us. Someone said that the strength of the nation derives from the integrity of the home. The three major influences in a child's early life are father, mother and teacher. What values are these three passing on to young minds about honesty, accountability, service, resisting injustice, defending the weak?

It is not easy to win the war against corruption. Corruption has become a national tragedy whose effects are felt across the political divide. When an MP dictates who is awarded education bursaries, deserving and needy children are left out.  When a member of the county assembly corrupts the system so that a tender is awarded to a family member or a friend's firm, the rules of fair competition are flouted. To fight corruption, we must set aside our tribal, political, and religious differences and face it as a common problem. Tribalism has failed to work for us, instead only succeeding in dividing us even further. The situation is so bad that political disagreement could spark trouble worse than the 2007/2008 violence. A ROLE TO PLAY The Executive, the Legislature, the clergy, civil society, and ordinary Kenyans all have a role to play in freeing this country from the bondage of corruption. Ordinary citizens are the most exposed to corruption and this places them in an ideal position to provide information to the authorities for action. While Kenyans have demonstrated willingness to provide information related to corruption, there is lack of responsive action on the part of the government. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has not taken any decisive action against big corruption. The clergy, which is influential in this country, can regularly remind the flock about the disadvantages of corruption that affect the economy and retard development. The Legislature should make serious laws to address corruption, such as harsh penalties for those found guilty of graft. They should display the same zeal that they did when they passed the security laws last year. The Executive, headed by President Uhuru Kenyatta, has the power to worsen or improve the corruption situation. Together with his Cabinet and other appointees in government, he should strive to leave a legacy as a regime that made big strides in fighting corruption. He can use his authority to influence legislative action to the debate on corruption. POOR WORKING CONDITIONS I think that one of the hardest jobs in Kenya is that of a police officer manning a roadblock. Carrying a loaded gun in one hand and receiving a bribe with the other in the full glare of the public, which knows that you are breaking the very law you should be protecting, is not an easy task. I do not believe that corruption thrives in the police force because of greed; I think it is because of the poor working conditions of the members of the disciplined forces. Better pay and shelter would go a long way in decreasing cases of corruption among the police.  Civil society should have a bigger presence in the rural and urban areas and continue empowering citizens by providing information and resources to assist them to keep both the national and the county governments in check. I have no doubt that we can rewrite our country's narrative on corruption. We need to remind ourselves every day that we, the ordinary citizens, are the foundation and spark for the progress and development of our country. The bright future we yearn for is determined by what we do today. We must all play our part. The writer is a communication assistant at a local NGO.

Grand corruption is back and practised in such a big scale that no one can ignore its presence. It is a phenomenon that is slowly getting out of control. There is also petty corruption that you meet when seeking services in government offices as well as in private sector offices.  The causes of these two forms of corruption are also different. This difference is rarely appreciated. The face of petty corruption is very simple. You meet askaris ""eating"" from mama mboga. You meet the traffic police ""eating""  from matatus or the regular police literary eating from ordinary citizens. Petty corruption makes the life of ordinary citizens quite difficult. It makes it very costly for the ordinary person to seek justice or service from public officers. Petty corruption is the result of two problems. One is poor delivery of services by public institutions. The second is the failure to punish the corrupt. The corrupt usually get away with it especially if they have influential principals. Studies now show that poor supply of public goods is the single most important cause of petty corruption. People have to queue for public goods and services when provision is inadequate or inefficient. Those at the end of the queue usually jump the queue by paying a fee to the officials providing the service. They get quick services at the expense of those not able to pay. CORRUPTION HURTS THE POOR Corruption, whether petty or grand, generally hurts the poor more than the rich. It deprives the poor of the little they have. It adds more to those who already have. For the poor, corruption is such a tragic event that it leaves them mourning throughout. A particular real life incident some years back illustrates this in a clearer manner. Dick is a friend who fell sick and was hospitalised. Doctors in this public hospital recommended surgery. He remained in hospital in pain for several weeks because there was only one surgical bed. There was a long queue of other patients waiting for the bed. With excruciating pain, Dick approached one of the nurses for help. She had a very clear and short answer: ""Get about Sh50,000 and you will get the bed."" This money would help secure and hide the bed on a Friday evening and over the weekend until early Monday morning. This was ""facilitation fee"" for the nurse and a chain of others including probably the doctor. Dick raised the money through harambee. The bed was secured and Dick had a successful surgery. He recovered quite well. Dick benefited at the expense of other patients. Those not able to raise the money remained in the ward for long. The absence of enough surgical beds prompted this corrupt behaviour. There are instances where officials deliberately undermine service delivery to cause queues. They may occasion a breakdown of computer systems, the machinery and anything else required to provide efficient services. In all these instances, no one bears the consequences. Those involved get away with it. THE SOLUTION The solution to petty corruption is simple -- improve on service delivery. This solution lies at the doorstep of Cabinet Secretaries and Principal Secretaries as well as heads of service delivery parastatals. Unfortunately very few public institutions have shown improvement in service delivery. Neither is the law effectively applied to punish errant officers. The face of grand corruption is not complex either. It involves the big and influential individuals. It involves grabbing of public land, inflating prices of contracts given by public offices, and generally stealing from the government. Here you will meet MPs eating from government ministries and parastatals. They demand award of contracts to their own companies or those owned by friends. Parastatal chiefs are not left out in this too. They eat from where they work. Grand corruption involves plunder of public resources in a big way and involves ""big"" people. They are big in economic and political influence. The causes of grand corruption are few but intertwined. First is greed. This is quite common among the rich and politicians. The rich fear sliding back into poverty. They keep on amassing wealth especially through public sources to firmly seal holes of poverty. This is true especially for those who rise from poverty to riches through any way including working hard. With our weak rule of law and limited sense of accountability, those who steal from the public and have political influence get away with it. Greed leads to plunder without consequences. In fact, over time, there has emerged a new moral value that glorifies riches through corrupt and other illicit habits. Wealth through corruption is wealth like any other. GRAND CORRUPTION The second cause of grand corruption is political. Newly elected leaders usually get to power without money. Some would have spent lots of it in their campaigns. Once they get into public office, they begin to look for money for another election and to compensate themselves. They run protection rings around those with wealth but without political influence. Grand corruption involves just ""eating"" Kenya. It is done by already rich and influential elites who are keen to secure themselves. Viewed this way, the spate of corruption scandals witnessed in the last few years has everything to do with the next elections including the 2022 presidential election. Grand corruption, unlike petty corruption, has huge implications for the economy. It undermines quality of goods and services. It moves money away from public services to private hands. For example, the Auditor-General's report for the 2012/2013 budget noted that it is difficult to say whether Sh337 billion was incurred in a lawful manner or not. This amount represents about 24 per cent of the 2012/2013 budget. If this money was lost through unlawful means, then we can safely argue that we lost 24 per cent of the budget. Sh337 billion would have financed the ministries of Education, Water, Agriculture, Medical Services and even Roads in the 2012/2013 financial year. If this money was to be divided among the 18,000 public primary schools in the country, each school would get about Sh18.8 million. This would have transformed all public primary schools. Media reports show there is loss of a billion or billions of shillings in procurement scandals. If these were put to basic services, the result would be better access to services by the poor. Corruption simply erases the dream for the poor to live better lives. A solution to grand corruption lies in a very simple approach. This involves arresting and successfully prosecuting a few corrupt and powerful individuals. If arrests are done in a succession, one case after another, things will change. But the corrupt usually fight back in an organised manner. They can cause changes in the law. They can also terminate careers of many. The question then is: Who is to bell the cat? And which cat do you begin to bell?

Mr Sonko took the documents to the County Assembly early this week and demanded action against county chiefs including Governor Evans Kidero over what he termed as corrupt dealings at City Hall."233,Daily Nation (Kenya),2/14/2015,WAMUGUNDA: There is no other option than to tackle corruption,,KENYA (50%),1144,Newspaper,DOMINIC WAMUGUNDA -1,ENGLISH,,14-Feb-15,"NAIROBI, KENYA (50%)",447  words,CORRUPTION (91%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION (78%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (77%); CIVIL SERVICES (77%); LAND USE PLANNING (73%); COUNTIES (72%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (68%); RETIREMENT & RETIREES (66%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (63%),"Fighting corruption is not going to be easy because as you know it always fights back. Dear Mr President, I listened to you talk to young people who are being mentored in ICT so that they may then be absorbed into government service when you came to launch a presidential digital talent programme at our institution the other day.  You talked with passion as you pointed out to them what kind of a future they should aim at helping to build. As you admitted that we still are suffering from the yoke of corruption, you laid particular emphasis to the question of integrity and pleaded with these young talented people to bring freshness into the public service. As I listened to you, many things went through my mind. I found myself asking where this country would be if some scams such as Goldenberg had not happened. That is only one example. There are many more. The noise we hear about land allocation and records in the lands office is another example of the rot that has been taking place in public service. The many lives we may have lost because hospitals and health centres went without medicine is yet another. We can mention many. Take the many cases of retired people who have had to wait for decades for their pensions because their files were missing at the NSSF. The list is endless. The bottom line, however, is as I have often said in this column that there are many people even in very high places who understand government to be a cake that must be eaten in the here and now. On the same day you came to our university Mr President, you appointed a commission to deal with the Makueni matter. Governor Kibwana stated that he was quite happy to leave the job of governor if that is what it takes to fight corruption. What I understood Prof Kibwana as saying is that the MCAs in Makueni have wanted to impeach him because he has refused to allow public resources to be misused. The other day we saw a survey of what percentages of the devolved funds have gone into development and the results were quite an eye opener. NOT EASY The fights we have witnessed between the central and the county governments have been about nothing else other than people wanting to personally access public resources, which after all ""do not belong to anybody's mother"". Mr President! Fighting corruption is not going to be easy because as you know it always fights back. The question is; do we have an option? The monster is big but giving up is certainly not an option. The confidence of Kenyans can only be restored if some major corruption cases can be exposed and punished. You can do it.

A highly anticipated report on how millions of US dollars meant for fighting the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone were managed has indicted the government.  It revealed massive irregularities in awarding of contracts and management of the funds totalling over $30M meant for purchases of ambulances, building of treatment centers and payment of Ebola front line workers. The report, submitted to parliament confirmed a long held suspicion of corruption within the ministry of Health and Sanitation which has been managing the funds. This, critics say, may have slowed the response to the epidemic. The report found the ministry wanting for failing to produce any documentation for contract agreements amounting to Le17billion ($4M), including Le12.7 billion ($3M) meant for the purchase of ambulances and Le2.7billion ($700, 000) for the construction of a treatment center. The report, done by the constitutionally mandated Audit Service Sierra Leone, covers the months May to October 2014, shortly before the epidemic took a firm grip on the country. Payment of Ebola workers have also been shrouded in confusion. The report  also revealed a possible connivance between government officials and civil society activists working on the anti-Ebola drive. About $90, 000 was lodged into the personal account of a renowned civil society activist, it revealed.

Suspicions of corruption have particularly derailed the work of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) chaired by ODM Secretary-General Ababu Namwamba.  The committee investigates how government institutions and various parastatals spend public funds. When they gathered at their usual meeting room at Parliament Buildings last Thursday, PAC members had hoped that the disharmony in their team would be resolved amicably. However, disagreements among members and their unsuccessful attempt to kick out Mr Namwamba as chairman escalated after information about the infighting leaked out. The team had been so careful to keep their business secret that during an earlier meeting on Tuesday, the clerks who form the committee's secretariat had been asked to excuse the MPs. ""Our last meeting aborted and members parted ways acrimoniously,"" a member of the committee would later say. ""We don't know when the next meeting will be held but I have heard that signatures are being collected (to oust Mr Namwamba),"" he added. Members of the committee, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue and House rules, claimed that some of their colleagues were involved in bribery, coercion and improper contact with some of the individuals being investigated by the committee. There have even been claims that some members became concerned after hearing allegations that their colleagues collected bribes on their behalf but failed to deliver the money. If such claims are finally substantiated, the major concern to the public would be that MPs were not worried that their colleagues accepted bribes, but that they did not share them. Mr Namwamba has accused some of his colleagues on the team of being agents of those who do not want to be exposed. A day before the Thursday meeting, Speaker Justin Muturi had attempted to intervene but was informed that the issue would be resolved internally. ""The problems we are having at the PAC now clearly explain why we have not had any substantive input from Parliament by way of oversight,"" said Mr Samuel Kimeu, the executive director of Transparency International. ""There are too many allegations of corruption, some of them credible, and they find their way into Parliament, they are investigated but when politics and corruption come into play, nothing comes of the report,"" he said, lamenting that corruption has made Parliament toothless.  WAR AGAINST THE PARTY On Monday, the Cord leadership called for and then cancelled a parliamentary group meeting with the agenda, according to a text message sent to MPs being ""the war being waged against the party in PAC"". ""(I) am faced by a classical case of the vampire of corruption fighting back viciously. Please come to our coalition PG tomorrow 9am at Orange House and help me confront this impunity,"" Mr Namwamba had said in the message to his party colleagues. However, that meeting was called off an hour later, with Minority Whip Thomas Mwadeghu saying it had been postponed. A party official told the Daily Nation afterwards there was an internal disagreement over the matter. Members of PAC are tomorrow scheduled to vote on a Motion of no confidence against Mr Namwamba. Former Governance and Ethics Permanent Secretary John Githongo said: ""When Parliament's key oversight committees are perceived as being corruptly compromised, it undermines not only our democracy, but the rule of law. ""It makes a mockery of Parliament's oversight role, allows the plunder of national resources, betrays the public trust and further undermines the legitimacy of already mistrusted institutions of governance."" In the corridors of Parliament, allegations are that MPs can be bought for as little as Sh10,000 to vote in a certain way or to sway opinion in committees. Allegations are also being traded about two committee chairmen who were allegedly bought cars by a State corporation suspected to have lost billions of shillings in fake development deals. The claims are unsubstantiated but they point to the air of suspicion in the House. This suspicion of ""rent-seeking"" has persisted, despite concerns by the House leadership from as far back as March last year, when Deputy Minority Leader Jakoyo Midiwo said: ""I spoke here last week about the issue of rent-seeking because it is out there."" In a commentary at the end of 2014, the Speaker wrote of his worries that committee work was being used ""as a rent-seeking avenue by ravenous leaders"". ""You get indications that something is amiss when a committee is designated or seizes a matter, conducts investigations but takes ages to report back to the House,"" he wrote. Mr Kimeu said that while the allegations have been made over and over again, ""there seems to be very little resolve to deal with that challenge on integrity issues"". Integrity and the corruption allegations are likely to be on the agenda when the House leadership -- Speaker Muturi,  the Majority and Minority Leaders and the committee chairmen -- heads to Mombasa at the end of this week for a retreat. INTEGRITY Mr Muturi last year asked the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to advise the Parliamentary Service Commission on an integrity framework for MPs, with focus starting from MPs' fraudulent mileage claims. ""Parliament has a serious problem of integrity but the Speaker and the leadership of Parliament have a responsibility to protect the integrity of Parliament... It's a sorry state that we are in but I don't think we can afford to lose Parliament,"" said Mr Kimeu. Mr Githongo recommended more drastic action. ""The Speaker should quit if these allegations are coming in so thick and fast and he's doing nothing about it."" Minority Leader Francis Nyenze disagreed that Parliament has an integrity problem. ""I think some of these are speculation. If anybody has information about committees, or has given money, let them come forth,"" he said. According to him, corruption fights back."236,Daily Nation (Kenya),2/27/2015,KIAI: 'Rubbergate' scandal brings to the fore endemic corruption in Kenya,,KENYA (95%); UNITED STATES (79%); UNITED KINGDOM (57%),1144,Newspaper,MAINA KIAI -1,ENGLISH,,27-Feb-15,"NAIROBI, KENYA (78%)",651  words,BRIBERY (93%); CORRUPTION (91%); ELECTIONS (89%); FINES & PENALTIES (78%); ELECTION AUTHORITIES (77%); RACISM & XENOPHOBIA (76%); CROSS EXAMINATIONS (71%); TERRORISM (66%),"The issue of impunity in Kenya has once again been highlighted by the ""rubbergate"" scandal where a US company has been fined for bribing key officials to get contracts. It follows on the heels of the ""chickengate"" scandal where key officials of the election management and examination bodies allegedly took bribes to channel contracts to a British company.  In both instances, foreign courts unravelled the endemic corruption that exists in Kenya and this only because it involved their companies. But for these foreign efforts we would never have known about this. We can only imagine how much we have lost to domestic companies -- and to companies that do not have laws similar to the US and UK-- that bribe, safe in the knowledge that they have impunity. But corruption can only end when decision makers do not solicit or accept bribes. It is great to go after the bribe-givers but the real perpetrator is the decision maker who solicits and accepts bribes. This impunity is the challenge of our time. It pervades every part of our society. It is the reason for the existential challenges that we face with terrorism, insecurity and tribalism. And it is the reason why we almost descended into civil war in 2008, if we accept the ICC Prosecutor's brief in the Kenyatta case that was released in January. NOT SERIALISED The brief makes for fascinating reading, and it is amazing that not a single media outlet has serialised or condensed it into an easy read. We don't have to agree with it, and yes, it has not been tested in cross-examination, but the fact that it passed the confirmation of charges stage and only lacked verification of the assertions, should mean we take it seriously. Reading it makes it clear why Uhuru Kenyatta's British legal team has released its own dossier, but unfortunately it does not respond to prosecutor's stark arguments. For instance, the prosecutor asserts that the problems started in September 2007, when a group led by Francis Muthaura decided that President Mwai Kibaki would retain power, ""tupende, tusipende."" And when we remember that it was around then that the Electoral Commission of Kenya became the Electoral Commission of Kibaki, this begins to make sense. And things become clearer when we remember the attempt to use Administration Police as agents for Kibaki in known anti-Kibaki zones. The whole notion of ""revenge killings"" in Naivasha and Nakuru is challenged when we learn that the Mungiki teams sent there had already been tested in Nairobi and wrought serious damage to purported ODM supporters.  BEEN KILLED Other key points stand out. First, all the key Mungiki people reportedly involved in the planning and execution of the violence that Mr Kenyatta allegedly facilitated have been killed or disappeared since April 2008. Charles Ndung'u Wagacha, who was said to be in constant communication with Muthaura, was ""... killed by police in April 2008."" Maina Diambo, a key Mungiki official was ""arrested in June 2008 and subsequently disappeared."" Other senior Mungiki officials Naftali Irungu, aka Marcus, Anthony Mwenje (aka Noriega), Njoroge Gichere, Timothy Mburu Gatira, Njuguna Gitau Njuguna and George Njoroge Wagacha, were all killed or disappeared. Unsavoury as these Mungiki leaders may have been, there has never been investigations or accountability for their killings and disappearances. Second, it is noteworthy that a lot of the intermediaries are in senior state roles. Muthaura is the chairman of Lappset way beyond retirement age. Francis Kimemia, who attempted to become the new Muthaura, is Secretary to the Cabinet; Njee Muturi is Solicitor-General and John Mututho was appointed Nacada chairman after losing his parliamentary seat. In other words, even though the case against Mr Kenyatta was withdrawn, the brief shows that there are many unanswered questions around the post-election violence. mkiai2000@yahoo.com"237,Daily Nation (Kenya),2/28/2015,Spotlight turns on Judiciary in fight against grand corruption,,KENYA (94%),1144,Newspaper,MURITHI MUTIGA -1,ENGLISH,,28-Feb-15,,1334  words,CORRUPTION (93%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); PETITIONS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (89%); MAGISTRATES (78%); LAWYERS (78%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (78%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (78%); LITIGATION (78%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (78%); JUDGES (76%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (72%); DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS (66%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT (65%),"New cases will provide a key test to determine how much has changed in the halls of justice. The decision to prosecute the key players behind the Anglo Leasing scandal now turns the spotlight on the Judiciary, which some have accused of playing a less than sterling role in the war against corruption. Chief Justice Willy Mutunga has introduced a raft of reforms in the institution, sharply raising the number of judges and magistrates, narrowing the pay gap between employees at various levels and building courts across the country to make justice more accessible to Wanjiku.  But anti-graft campaigners say that over the last decades the courts have been staunch allies of those accused of corruption. The new cases will provide a key test to determine how much has changed in the halls  of justice. A long list of cases relating to corruption in the courts paints a picture of judges consistently taking the side of those accused of graft against investigators seeking to have them convicted. A review of the court battles shows the various tactics petitioners have used to block investigations. ECONOMIC CRIMES One of the cases relates to Petition Number 390 which involved claims by the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission that economic crimes were committed when Kenyan Government officials signed a deal for the supply of an integrated communication network for use by the Department of Defence. On October 30, 2008, a judge issued a decision that had the effect of stopping the commission's investigations, arguing that the Attorney-General had offered an opinion that the original agreement between Nedermar Technology BV and the Kenyan Government complied with the laws of Kenya. ""Granted that the contract was signed in the twilight days of the previous regime (in November 2002) and the legal battle is taking place in another regime (but) the office of the Honourable Attorney-General is an institution with institutional memory, and rules of common decency demand that the office maintains consistency in its opinions and representations based on the law,"" wrote Justice Joseph Nyamu, who was eventually forced out of his job by a subsequent vetting board. ""... The change of mind (by the AG) smacks of total lack of public morality and, even on this ground alone, the court finds that it would be difficult to conclude that what is driving the new position by the Attorney-General and the other government agencies including KACC is the public interest. On this ground alone, the court is entitled to stop them in their tracks."" This reasoning by the judge has subsequently been cited and applied in decisions relating to other Anglo Leasing security type contracts.  RIDDLED WITH IRREGULARITIES In another matter, a petitioner moved to court seeking to stop audit firm PricewaterhouseCoopers from investigating a contract for the supply and installation of communication equipment for  the administration police. PwC had found the process leading up to the award to have been riddled with irregularities. The court, however, agreed with the petitioner and issued a decision on July 10, 2008 whose effect was to quash the forensic audit report prepared by PwC on the grounds that procurement procedures were not followed in contracting the audit firm and that it was likely offences had been committed by the Treasury in undertaking the audit. An appeal by KACC against the decision was delayed after the copy of the judgment signed by the judge could not be traced. The anti-graft agency eventually wrote to the Deputy Registrar seeking a way forward on the matter. The judge's notes were finally found and a long delayed appeal lodged on August 25, 2014. Judicial review has been one of the most prominent methods of stalling investigations into corruption. Authorities in Switzerland, for example, have pursued the Anglo Leasing cases with a rare vigour because most of the looted money was channelled into the Swiss banking system, where a reputation for strict confidentiality among banks over client matters has meant that the European country is a favourite destination for individuals and firms whose income is suspected to have been obtained through graft. The help from the Swiss has come thanks to a Mutual Legal Agreement request sent from the anti-corruption commission to Swiss authorities on May 3, 2007 seeking help to investigate one of the Anglo Leasing type contracts in which the Kenya Government was to be supplied with computers, servers and satellite equipment. In a surprising verdict, judges in the High Court agreed with petitioners who had submitted that KACC had no powers to enter into a mutual legal agreement with a foreign government because it was not a state party. On that basis, the letter requesting MLA with Swiss authorities was declared irregular. However, the Court of Appeal quashed the High Court decision, holding that KACC had powers to pursue mutual legal assistance under section 12 (3) of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act (2003). Despite the success of many of the appeals by KACC, the fact that the earlier decisions have resulted in dragging out the process and causing delays has been a prime source of comfort to suspects. Investigators have often found themselves unable to act on information at hand in the face of court orders. In one case, Application number 114 of 2007 relating to the installation of a telecommunication network for the defunct Postal Corporation of Kenya, judges issued orders staying warrants and further investigations by KACC. Deepak Kamani whom KACC and Swiss authorities hold to have been at the heart of many of the Anglo Leasing contracts sued the Principal Immigration Officer and KACC over travel restrictions imposed on him. The court ordered the release of the passports of the Anglo Leasing suspects and gave orders whose effect was to bar the anti-graft agency from asking suspects to surrender their travel documents in the course of investigations. KACC won the case on appeal. The endless circus in the courts and the ready issuing of injunctive orders by judges has frustrated anti-graft campaigners. Writing in the Nation, Transparency International Kenya chief Samuel Kimeu called for speedy action this time. ""The prosecution team must be legally armed to tackle devices by suspects to manoeuvre the legal system; previous cases were botched by constitutional applications and other injunctions,"" he wrote. ""We expect that EACC and the DPP picked key lessons from previous investigations and prosecution that may be applied to ensure convictions this time."" Legal observers say some of the most damaging decisions issued by judges have included decrees that no criminal investigation should be launched into contracts bearing an arbitration clause. Despite the fact the overwhelming majority of the contracts in which corruption is alleged to have played a role relate to the security sector, judges have also held that contracts relating to national security should not be investigated by state agencies. Also, some judges have encouraged anti-corruption authorities to pursue asset recovery through a civil process and not through criminal prosecution. Bizarrely, a judge even queried why the anti-graft agents were investigating the existence of a ""ghost"" company yet the ""ghost"" had performed the contract. Anti-graft campaigners say the ultimate test will be whether the Executive and the Judiciary will have the political will and courage to push through with the cases. Mr Kimeu has called for asset recovery and also demanded greater levels of accountability from those at the top. ""The government is not out of the woods with regard to last year's Sh1.4 billion payments. Many Kenyans believe this payment, like others relating to Anglo Leasing, was unjustified,"" he said. ""Corruption scandals such as Anglo Leasing only serve to erode public confidence in the government, especially when no action is taken against public officers, other individuals and entities involved."""238,Daily Nation (Kenya),2/28/2015,ATWOLI: Corruption is a way of life here,,KENYA (94%); UNITED KINGDOM (90%),1144,Newspaper,LUKOYE ATWOLI -1,ENGLISH,,28-Feb-15,"NAIROBI, KENYA (78%)",563  words,CORRUPTION (94%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (90%); BRIBERY (90%); LARCENY & THEFT (90%); ETHICS (78%); SCANDALS (78%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (77%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (77%); ELECTIONS (74%); TRANSPORTATION LAW (62%); SPEED LIMITS (60%); DRIVERS LICENSES (60%); DRIVING & TRAFFIC LAWS (60%),"We have created an environment where thievery is rewarded. There's been a lot of talk recently about bringing to book suspects involved in mega corruption scandals, especially after a court in the United Kingdom convicted two businessmen of engaging in corrupt practices with some Kenyan public officials.  The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has finally moved to begin investigations, interviewing officials suspected of involvement in the bribery scams. All well and good. Unfortunately all Kenyans seem to know how this will pan out. The amount of cynicism out there is overwhelming. Over the past thirty years or so, numerous scams have been reported involving theft of huge amounts of money from government coffers, and most of the perpetrators are well known public figures. Interestingly, many are able to continue with very public lives, and even run for and win public office. As a matter of fact, involvement in such scams seems to give people leverage when it comes to elective office, perhaps because of the notoriety gained due to their audacious actions as well as the overwhelming desire among Kenyans for ""heroes"". Equally likely, though, these mega-thieves steal such huge amounts of money that make it easier for them to bribe their way into high office, including bribing the voters themselves. The question that arises, then, is why it seems so easy for perpetrators of corrupt acts to get away with it in this country. The answer is quite simple. THIEVERY REWARDED As a people, we have accepted that one cannot get ahead without greasing palms here and there, or stealing from wherever we work. We have agreed that stealing is only bad when you are caught, but that ""badness"" can be cured if you steal money in the range of billions of shillings. This kind of theft entitles you to privileges not available to common citizens. You are allowed to engage in antisocial behaviour at will, you get away with ""petty"" crimes, and you get to hog media airtime as desired. During elections you get your free pick on which candidates will win, and if you become a candidate yourself, most opponents mysteriously step down in your favour, of course in exchange for some monetary consideration. We have created an environment where honest labour is punished, and thievery is rewarded. We may not like this reality, but it is the truth. In December last year, while driving from Eldoret to Nairobi, I was stopped by a police officer somewhere near Burnt Forest. I had kept within the speed limit, I had not flouted any traffic rules, and the vehicle was in good condition. The officer examined the car for a while, found no problem, and then came round to the driver's side. She asked me to show my driver's license, which I did. She looked at it and then gave it back to me. The officer then smiled at me, and told me that everything was in order. She then went straight to the point. ""What are you leaving me with?"" She was very surprised when I looked shocked. We spent a bit of time discussing why she thought I should pay her for essentially doing her job. In the end she let me go reluctantly, suggesting that I was somehow being unfair not to ""leave her with something"". That is the sad environment in which we are bringing up our children.

The seventh anniversary of the signing of the National Accord and Reconciliation Agreement passed quietly on Saturday, overshadowed by bickering in the National Assembly where the chair of the Public Accounts Committee, Ababu Namwamba, narrowly survived an impeachment attempt following accusations of corruption. During the last week alone, Namwamba was not the only person facing accusations of corruption.  A US corporation was ordered to pay heavy fines because its subsidiary bribed Kenyan officials to obtain tyre supply contracts, an arrangement that recalls the jailing, two weeks ago, of two British company executives for bribing another set of Kenyan officials to secure printing contracts. When added to a new face of land grabbing, all these developments lead, yet again, to the conclusion that Kenya is facing a serious problem of corruption but lacks credible responses to address the problem. The fight against corruption is unlikely to succeed any time soon, despite the investment in formal anti-corruption arrangements. Kenya is a post-conflict society following the serious violence of 2007/8. Post-conflict societies exhibit unique governance challenges, some of which are evident in Kenya. Corruption is defined as behaviour that deviates from the rules for personal gain. One of the problems of conflict is that it reduces orderly society into chaos and displaces the ""rules"". In a post-conflict society, where there has been a very public and recent experience of the large-scale upsetting of the ""rules"", determining what constitutes corruption becomes problematic. Even after formal peace agreements are signed, the effects of conflict linger on, and need a lot of time to overcome. Usually, not all sections of society support the settlement that brings an end to a conflict. There remain sections that hold out against the post-conflict political order, and in whose eyes the new leadership lacks legitimacy. At the same time, other sections of society embrace the new order, and the fact that one section opposes while another supports the new status quo sustains the polarisation on which conflict was based. BECOMES A GOVERNANCE TOOL Secondly, because leadership remains so contested even after the conflict is over, loyalty acquires a premium since it is the currency that sustains the new political leaders in power. In this context, corruption becomes a governance tool, something that has to be tolerated in order to maintain political stability. At the same time, corruption becomes opportunistic, something that those who support the new order expect to be allowed to engage in as compensation for their loyalty. The intermittent quarrels within Jubilee about tenders and state jobs reflect this behaviour. Thirdly, even after a peace agreement, all sides know that conflict can recur. Corruption is seen as necessary for stocking up, in the event that conflict recurs in future. For this reason, partisans on all sides easily tolerate corruption if perpetrated by their side, and only condemn it if perpetrated by others. That is why both Jubilee and Cord condemn corruption, so long as it is not on their side. The ending of the Kenyan conflict of 2007/8 was followed by a peace-building programme which had a number of logically constructed steps, over which the chief mediator, Kofi Annan, maintained oversight for the remainder of the grand coalition's term in office. When Jubilee came to power in 2013, the mediation platforms were de-activated and, in the period since, there no longer is a reference to the conflict or a shared discussion on how its long-term effects can be addressed. In Kenya which is ethnically polarised, Jubilee is seen as a continuation of Kibaki's PNU, if only because of the ethnic base from which it derives its core support base. However unsatisfactory it was, the Kibaki/Odinga coalition government ensured a measure of inclusion for sections of the population that had come against one another in the conflict of 2007/8. The Jubilee government, whose composition is constructed on a different basis, has left some of the dominant warring groups of 2007 out of power, before there has been complete recovery from its long-term effects. DIFFICULT TO ADDRESS If Jubilee is viewed as occupying the same continuum as PNU before, the feeling by those who supported, say, Odinga against Kibaki, would be that Uhuru Kenyatta is a reincarnation of Kibaki, whom they accuse of electoral fraud, without which their side would probably still be in power. All significant national challenges, such as insecurity, poverty, unemployment, and now the fight against corruption, are much more difficult to address because of Kenya's status as a post-conflict society. It is understandable that to consolidate itself in power, Jubilee would have been tempted to dismantle the platforms created for the mediation process. However, on its own, Jubilee cannot address Kenya's problems, both because of the polarised nature of the country and also because some of the support for Jubilee was secured, and is currently maintained, on a rent-seeking basis. Kenyatta's weak position in Jubilee has been demonstrated by how easily his URP partners get him to maintain the exclusive approach to public appointments, which disproportionately favours the core Jubilee ethnic groups, with the Inspector-General of Police and the Internal Security Cabinet Secretary being the latest examples. Discarding the mediation process will prove premature, since the resolution of all serious problems has tended to need dialogue. As currently organised, the only thing Jubilee is capable of ensuring is its own survival in power, but cannot solve the country's problems on its own. Corruption will therefore continue, at least until the next elections. gkegoro@gmail.com"240,Daily Nation (Kenya),3/6/2015,MAKOKHA: Parliament just the right forum to probe corruption,,KENYA (93%),1144,Newspaper,KWAMCHETSI MAKOKHA -1,ENGLISH,,7-Mar-15,,649  words,CORRUPTION (95%); INVESTIGATIONS (91%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (89%); ETHICS (77%); PRIVATIZATION (77%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (77%); HOTELS & MOTELS (61%); MOTOR VEHICLES (50%),"These malicious gossips speak of millions of shillings changing hands, favours bought and delivered, and questions asked or silenced in investigative reports. Speaker Justin Muturi's decision to refer the allegations of corruption in the Public Accounts Committee to the National Assembly's Powers and Privileges Committee is just what the doctor ordered. No institution in Kenya matches the experience that Parliament has in concluding corruption investigations. Each time the nonsense of corruption has got to the National Assembly, its members have dealt with it in a manner that has left everybody deeply satisfied. Parliament's record with corruption investigations is only matched by police reputation for solving mysterious deaths.  A few examples illustrate Parliament's competence. After initially listening to rumours about large-scale theft in the export compensation scheme known as Goldenberg in 1993, the Public Accounts Committee not only found the whole scheme kosher, but recommended that Mr Kamlesh Pattni deserved a Sh1.2 billion reward for his genius. Later efforts to besmirch the character of then Vice-President George Saitoti by linking him to the Goldenberg Affair received an emphatic parliamentary response. MPs voted to expunge the so-called List of Shame from the report of a special anti-corruption committee in 2000, seven years later. MALIGNING INVESTORS During his tenure as chairperson of the Public Investments Committee, Mr JB Muturi himself got misled into maligning investors who had put their money into Safaricom through a firm known as Mobitelea Ventures. Had the Muturi committee's misguided recommendations to halt the privatisation of Safaricom until its questions were answered been followed, Kenya would have been robbed of a corporate giant that grosses billions of shillings in profits each year. As it were, the owners of Mobitelea Ventures sold their shareholding in broad daylight and took their profits where they would be more welcome. The Mobitelea matter would resurface briefly when Parliament was discussing the sale of the Grand Regency Hotel in 2008 to Libyan investors. Similarly, Parliament has investigated corruption in the Anglo-Leasing type security deals since 2003, found that whereas certain things might not have happened as expected, the honest traders who supplied oxygen during the great carbon dioxide epidemic deserved to receive their payment in full -- 10 years later. Given its record in catching and punishing the Executive on corruption, Parliament cannot trust the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to undertake a delicate, highly emotional investigation involving its own members.  SPREADING WHISPERS Jealous and lazy people, imprisoned by their poverty of wealth and imagination, have been spreading whispers of corruption after seeing members of the PAC on hard-earned holidays, constructing mansions with their mortgages, or driving sports utility vehicles acquired with a compulsory government grant. These malicious gossips speak of millions of shillings changing hands, favours bought and delivered, and questions asked or silenced in investigative reports. It is only a matter of time before the House Powers and Privileges Committee puts these rumour-mongers to their eternal shame by holding public hearings into the various corruption allegations, complete with live television cameras. A day is soon coming when the people alleged to have paid millions of shillings in bribes will, knock-kneed, swim in a deluge of tears before the Powers and Privileges committee, denying ever knowing the PAC members even through TV appearance. Others will be weeping and flagellating themselves as they deny ever meeting MPs in hotel rooms, and handing over privilege paper bags overflowing with cash in the legitimate expectation that the reports produced would shield their deeds. kwamchetsi@formandcontent.co.ke"241,Daily Nation (Kenya),3/7/2015,WAMUGUNDA: Resigned to corruption: We no longer care,,KENYA (95%),1144,Newspaper,DOMINIC WAMUGUNDA -1,ENGLISH,,7-Mar-15,"NAIROBI, KENYA (78%)",453  words,CORRUPTION (90%); BRIBERY (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (88%),"It is unfortunate that Kenyans seem to have accepted corruption as our culture. I like to define culture as the basis upon which a society, a community or a group of people interpret their experience of their social and physical world and order their relationships into a coherent way of life.  Culture serves the purpose of making the world less mysterious and less frightening. It serves the need of laying out a predictable world in which everyone is firmly grounded. In every society, there are three types of needs that have to be satisfied. These are the basic, derived and integrative needs and culture does provide such satisfaction. At that point, I ask myself the question: What is our Kenyan culture? When one looks at some of the stories we read, questions arise. How would we describe our political culture? How would we describe our economic culture? I followed with keen interest the episode regarding a parliamentary watchdog committee a week ago. What came out were accusations and counter-accusations between members of the said committee and the intention to kick out their chairman which did not happen. The issues in question had to do with corruption. We have heard before that our Members of Parliament are bribed to vote one way or the other. It has also been said that those committees are not completely innocent in this regard. The unfortunate part is that we Kenyans seem to have accepted that as our culture. We all carry on with our lives as if this does not matter. Our members of parliament seat in the most sacred space designated for deliberations aimed at making this a greater nation and making laws that govern a sane society. Isn't that why we call them honourable people? Which honourable people would even conceive the idea of being bribed so that they may allow the perpetuation of bad practices that hurt our very existence as a national society? When this information comes out in the public sphere they just do their intrigues, exchange a few words and in no time we forget about it and life goes on. In civilized society, people in public office usually resign when they are named as having been involved in some shady behaviour. That rarely happens in Kenya. It is not part of our culture. The point I am making here is that I am afraid corruption has become so entrenched in the running of our institutions that many of us have internalised it as part of our way of doing things. That is why those battles about members of parliamentary committees being bribed do not seem to bother many of us. In fact we have forgotten about that incident and gone on to other current matters.

The second anniversary since the Jubilee Alliance took power coincides with the re-emergence of the kind of runaway corruption that characterised the Kanu regime. Jubilee took power on a manifesto that promised to give the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission the power to prosecute corruption cases; set up local anti-corruption boards at county level with the power to refer cases to the commission; ban anyone convicted on corruption charges from working in government, in any public sector job; enact the necessary legislation so that Kenyan companies found guilty of corrupt practices will be liable to have their assets frozen by the courts; ban foreign companies found guilty of corrupt practices from operating in Kenya; and, introduce an automatic freeze on the assets of anyone indicted on corruption charges.  The new government inherited a dysfunctional EACC, a fact that is mainly attributable to the controversy surrounding the chair Mumo Matemu. While Jubilee could have taken a proactive role in resolving the problems at EACC, it has chosen to allow things to drift on their own, thus undermining the chances of meeting its manifesto promises. Why has Jubilee chosen to remain passive on the affairs of the EACC, even in the face of a return of grand corruption? It is important, firstly, to understand the controversy in which Matemu finds himself. The process leading to his appointment commenced in September 2011, during the life of the Grand Coalition government. Following interviews, President Mwai Kibaki nominated Matemu for appointment as chair, and four others as members of the EACC. The Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, designated to handle the nominations on behalf of the National Assembly, however, rejected Matemu's nomination and those of the two other commissioners, stating that theyŒæ""lacked the passion, initiative and the drive to lead the fight against corruption"". In plenary, however, the Assembly reversed the committee's recommendations and approved Matemu and the other members for appointment. After a five-month delay, in May 2012, President Kibaki appointed Matemu as chair of EACC but a suit was filed challenging the appointment, based on arguments that he did not meet the constitutional requirement for appointment because of acts and omissions on his part, including fraud, while holding a senior position at the Agricultural Finance Corporation. The High Court reversed the Assembly's approval of the Matemu nomination but a subsequent appeal to the Court of Appeal reversed the High Court ruling, clearing the way for his appointment.  Importantly, the Court of Appeal decision was based on technical reasoning. The court stated that its proceedings were not the forum for determining whether the allegations against Matemu were true or not. The court did not make a finding on the substance of the claims against him which, thus, have remained unresolved. Matemu assumed office in July 2013, and a further appeal to the Supreme Court, is pending. PARALLELS There are clear parallels between the Matemu situation and the situation that has faced Kenyatta and Ruto. Like Matemu, the two also faced suitability challenges before the High Court while seeking to run for president. The arguments against their candidature were the same as those made against Matemu. The High Court dismissed the case against them, clearing the way for them to run. Kenyatta and Ruto have often projected themselves as victims of people who wanted to use the judicial process to prevent them from ruling this country. Similarly, Matemu has projected himself as a victim of the use of the judicial process to deny him a position he has earned. Secondly, the Jubilee presidential venture, which began when Kenyatta and Ruto were both facing charges before the ICC, was based on arguments that elevate democratic rights, both of candidates and voters, over obligations based on notions of integrity. The High Court agreed with the argument that democratic rights are paramount, especially when coupled with the further argument that Kenyatta and Ruto were presumed innocent until found guilty. As a result, the court allowed them to run for office. There is a similarity between the Matemu and Kenyatta/Ruto situations. Matemu's argument is built on the fine point that, notwithstanding the existing allegations, there is no adverse finding against him, and, secondly, that he meets the formal qualifications for appointment, and was in fact appointed, to the office he holds. Like Kenyatta and Ruto, his is a sophistic argument based on a sense of entitlement. LAME DUCK Thirdly, Matemu is currently in the kind of situation that Uhuru has been in for the last two years, and one which still affects Ruto. As long as he faced charges before the ICC, Kenyatta remained lame-ducked, not knowing what his fate might be. The practical effect of the questions surrounding Matemu is that he is also lame ducked and so is the EACC. Between all three, a sympathetic relationship is only logical. While Matemu's personal situation is clearly hurting the EACC, and the fight against corruption, the Jubilee government is unlikely to be keen on promoting a process that resolves it. Fourthly, Matemu independently justifies the Jubilee ideology, that accountability is not important so long as one is popular. Letting him go because of integrity arguments would only create a precedent that could be used against Kenyatta and Ruto. Also, although Jubilee does not acknowledge it, the cases at the ICC against the President and the deputy have been a drag, and have left time for little else. Since the end of the President's case, he has appeared freer and more able to concentrate on his job. Finally, and particularly in the face of the ICC cases, addressing the Matemu situation has inherent political risks which Jubilee could not freely take while their own cases remained unresolved at the ICC. These reasons explain the lethargy in confronting the problems at the anti-corruption commission, and also indicate that for the time being, resolving the Matemu situation is not a priority."243,Daily Nation (Kenya),3/10/2015,"KABERIA: With House at the centre of corruption claims, what options do Kenyans have?",,KENYA (97%),1144,Newspaper,TIMOTHY KABERIA -1,ENGLISH,,10-Mar-15,,710  words,CORRUPTION (93%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); BRIBERY (90%); ADMISSIONS & CONFESSIONS (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); POLITICS (78%); CIVIL AVIATION (71%); AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (71%); INVESTIGATIONS (68%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (67%),"Mr Ababu Namwamba, the chairman of the Parliamentary Accounts Committee, is under siege. He has been accused of abetting corruption, receiving bribes, and doctoring documents. He has also made counter-accusations of corruption against members of the defunct committee he led.  Before Mr Namwamba's tribulations came out in the open, Parliament's leadership retreated to Mombasa and came up with a raft of rules for MPs in what it described as an effort to ""restore the image of Parliament."" This was a rare confession that the hitherto honourable House had completely lost the respect, honour, and dignity befitting a national legislative body. However, what followed leaves more questions than answers about the real motives of the retreat. Was it really an effort to rehabilitate Parliament's image or a scheme to strategise the fall of Mr Namwamba and his committee? Whether Mr Namwamba is the captain of ""MPs for hire"" or a victim of political machinations remains to be seen. However, there is no doubt that both he and the committee members he accuses of ""eating chicken"" are culprits in this circus of corruption. Mr Namwamba's tribulations are not unique. In fact, this has become the norm rather than the exception in Kenya's Parliament. Those levelling accusations against their peers in the committee do not even pretend to be fighting corruption in the PAC; rather they are lamenting that the chairman and other members did not share the bribes. Were it not for Mr Namwamba's party ODM's perennial factional fighting and the ruling Jubilee's strategy of striking at the weakest link, allegations of corruption within PAC would never have become public knowledge. It is a classic example of the enemy of my enemy is my friend. The PAC is not the only committee of Parliament that needs to be disbanded because of corruption. Speaker Muturi's interest in investigating the PAC allegations and subsequent takeover of its functions is suspect. He could be serious about fighting corruption in Parliament. Unfortunately, most Kenyans have little, if any, faith in Parliament as an anti-corruption crusader. Many are wondering about the Speaker's motives for suspending the committee. Was the committee scheduled to summon some sacred cows in coming weeks? What about the re-emergence of Anglo Leasing? Can the Speaker or Mr Namwamba make public the PAC's schedule for the next few months? Obviously, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission's ""Chickengate"" and Mumias Sugar's woes are top candidates for PAC grilling. LANGATA ROAD Were Kenya Civil Aviation Authority officials expected to appear before the committee to explain how they lost land to the  developer who attempted to annex the Lang'ata Road Primary School's playground? Whether Mr Namwamba is guilty or not, the sudden ""love"" he has received from western Kenya politicians is a clear indication of what ails Kenya. Western Kenya politicians seem to believe that Nyanza politicians in and outside the PAC had ganged up against Mr Namwamba to settle ODM scores. On the other hand, western Kenya MPs are leading an onslaught on Governor Evans Kidero in the Mumias Sugar scandal. There are too many corruption scandals involving MPs. It is, therefore, foolhardy to expect the current crop of MPs to rehabilitate the image and authority of Parliament. The Waiguru impeachment drama is a case in point. The architect of this soap opera, Igembe South MP Mithika Linturi, made a joke of parliamentary process when he fled as he was expected to table the Motion against the Cabinet secretary. Several MPs alleged that Mr Linturi had been persuaded to abandon, at the eleventh hour, a Motion he had so vigorously lobbied for.  There were threats of disciplinary action against Mr Linturi, but the Mpeketoni massacre took the focus off him. Parliament is charged with protecting the public's interests, but the fact of the matter is that the current crop of MPs cannot be trusted with any oversight role. Perhaps we need a snap election or the return of the recall clause that the MPs killed, to help Parliament clean up its dented reputation as a corrupt institution.

Foreign diplomats have told the government to pursue all top corruption suspects if it is to tame the monster that is threatening to devour the economy. This comes as constitutional and economic experts say integrity laws should be strengthened to tackle the crisis.  US Ambassador Robert Godec, his Swiss colleague Jacques Pitteloud and British High Commissioner Christian Turner said the Kenyatta administration should find and prosecute the masterminds of corruption-related scandals. The diplomats spoke in the wake of the ""MPs for hire"" scandal that has rocked Parliament. Graft-related issues have also surfaced at the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission where top officials are clashing over cases under investigation. Claims have been made of top officials secretly meeting suspects on the agency's radar while others have been accused for delaying investigations in certain high profile cases. Also in the spotlight are Cabinet Secretary for Energy Davies Chirchir and top electoral commission officials, including Chairman Ahmed Issack Hassan, over the ""Chicken"" scandal. ""The governments of the United States, United Kingdom and Switzerland welcome recent actions by the Director of Public Prosecutions to combat corruption by ordering prosecutions linked to the decade-old Anglo Leasing scandal,"" the diplomats said in a joint statement. They said the subsequent arrests were important steps in the fight against corruption. ""We encourage the government to build further on these actions, to include through independent and vigorous investigations of all allegations of corruption, and through fair trials and equal treatment under the law for all those charged,"" they said. ETHICS SYSTEM Commission for the Implementation of the Constitution chairman Charles Nyachae said Parliament should use existing integrity laws to deal with the graft claims bedevilling it. ""Laws on leadership and integrity are in place and should be used to deal with the cases,"" he said. But constitutional lawyer Wachira Maina said Kenya should design an ethics system to check MPs' voracious appetite for easy money. ""MPs might retort that there is, in fact, such a code of ethics. True. But it is the generic one under the Leadership and Integrity Act 2012 which, invariably, is honoured in breach by all those to whom it applies,"" he said. ""The EACC is also rocked by corruption scandals of its own. The emerging problem is clear: neither the PAC nor the discredited EACC can credibly attack corruption. More is the pity given that Kenya will have a General Election in two years when votes and money, not necessarily in that order, win elections,"" Mr Maina says.  The Institute of Certified Public Accountants-Kenya has also weighed in with a call for an independent body to investigate the PAC graft allegations. ""We are not comfortable with the Powers and Privileges Committee investigating their counterparts in the PAC,"" the institute's chairman, Mr Benson Okundi, said. ""If any MP is found culpable and they belong to our professional body, we will not hesitate to delist them,"" he said. He asked other bodies like the Law Society of Kenya to similarly punish any of their members if found guilty. Mr Okundi was speaking in Kisumu during the institute's annual meeting for members from the region. EXECUTIVE ORDER Last week, President Kenyatta, who appears helpless as the monster envelopes his administration, issued an executive order in which he complained about widespread corruption among State and public servants. ""My office continues to receive numerous briefs, reports and complaints from citizens of blatant breaches of ethical standards, pilferage and outright theft involving civil servants, State and public officers. These unsavoury, unethical and corrupt practices continue to thrive in spite of various reminders and warnings,"" he said. On Friday, two MPs involved in the PAC scandal accused embattled chairman Ababu Namwamba of hiring a comedian to mimic his colleagues in a recording tabled before a House team. The MPs, who have been mentioned in the bribery scandal, claimed they were victims of a well-planned and executed blackmail plot by Mr Namwamba after they tried to oust him from his powerful position. ""He only produced the so-called recording days after members of the committee decided he should be kicked out for incompetence and doctoring reports. In fact, he is on record saying he will not go down alone,"" said Nyatike MP Edick Anyanga. He denied meeting Defence PS Mutea Iringo to discuss or take a Sh1.5 million bribe. ""It is laughable for Mr Namwamba to claim that I sat somewhere to discuss a bribe of a mere Sh1.5 million ... people know I can't be that cheap,"" he said angrily. The MP said Mr Namwamba is trying to smear his name due to his previous interest in the PAC chairmanship. ""This is a desperate attempt by a man under siege to divert attention,"" he said. Nakuru Town West MP Samuel Arama said he was surprised to hear of the recording. ""Namwamba engineered my removal from the Public Accounts Committee claiming that I was a rebel. How then could it have been possible for me to sit down with him and Mr Raila Odinga to discuss things that I had nothing to do with? That recording is the work of a good trickster,"" Mr Arama said. The two lawmakers, Maara MP Kareke Mbiuki and his Runjenjes counterpart Cecily Mbarire are said to have pocketed Sh200,000 each from a Sh1.5 million bribe allegedly paid by Mr Iringo."246,Daily Nation (Kenya),3/14/2015,MPs' ability to play watchdog role undermined by corruption allegations,,KENYA (97%),1144,Newspaper,CAROLINE WAFULA -1,ENGLISH,,14-Mar-15,,623  words,INVESTIGATIONS (93%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); BRIBERY (90%); EXTORTION (89%); POLITICS (74%); CIVIL SERVICES (72%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (72%); CONSULTING SERVICES (68%),"Over the last one year, a number of committees have been accused of being on the take. The ability of MPs to conduct their oversight role over government has been drastically diminished following recent claims of extortion and bribery in House committees. The Public Accounts Committee is not the first. Over the last one year, a number of other committees have been accused of being on the take.  The claims will affect the credibility of investigations by the Agriculture Committee, Public Investment Committee and others into governance issues. In the past, persons and institutions under investigation have claimed that MPs demanded bribes with threats of bad reports if they did not play along. In the 10th Parliament in 2012, members of the Committee on Health almost came to blows over findings and recommendations of a final report. Their investigation into alleged corruption and mismanagement of a civil servants' medical cover scheme ended on a fiery note with chairperson Robert Monda receiving death threats after he tabled the final report in Parliament. At the end of it all, Dr Monda was left standing alone to present the report that faulted the health scheme amid jeers as members of his committee disowned its contents. In the current Parliament, the Agriculture Committee is also on spot over its investigation into the sugar sector where it is alleged that money changed hands. VESTED INTERESTS The Sunday Nation has also learnt that there has been an attempt by some members to reopen investigations that were concluded by their predecessors. Some of the involved people claimed members of the committee demanded cash, threatening a fresh investigation if they did not pay up. Some committees allegedly delay tabling reports in the National Assembly and use their findings to blackmail those under investigation. Vested interests have been cited as the main reason why some committees clash over particular investigations, resulting in duplication of inquiries. This happened when the Public Investments and Transport committees insisted and went ahead to conduct parallel investigations into the standard gauge railway. Both teams gave the project a clean bill of health, with the PIC only adding that the project should proceed on condition the government hired an independent consultant to review the design and oversee construction. Some reports of committee investigations have been criticised for being influenced by political and financial interests. Speaker of the National Assembly Justin Muturi is quoted saying Parliament, charged with oversight of other institutions, cannot demand accountability from other institutions ""yet we are rotting from inside"".  ""We must always stand tall as the towering institution of integrity and accountability,"" he said. In a 2012 report, the Institute for Social Accountability said party politics and supremacy fights often hinder MPs from objectively carrying out their oversight tasks. The institute said parliamentary committees often have no intention of addressing the root causes of corruption or following up their findings, especially when those implicated are allies of the ""investigators"". ""Parliamentary committees sometimes whitewash issues,"" it said. In a meeting in Mombasa last year, Mr Muturi confirmed fears that some committee proceedings were driven by the selfish interests of members. He wondered why cases of members or committees clashing only arose on matters involving the awarding of contracts and never on legislative issues. The National Assembly Speaker reiterated this when, in his end year appraisal of the House, he cautioned members that committee work of the National Assembly must not be used as rent-seeking avenues by greedy leaders."247,Daily Nation (Kenya),3/14/2015,MUTIGA: Citizens can take steps to tackle grand corruption,,"KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); UGANDA (92%); ASIA (79%); PHILIPPINES (79%); KENYA (79%)",1144,Newspaper,MURITHI MUTIGA -1,ENGLISH,,14-Mar-15,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (79%)",712  words,CORRUPTION (91%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (90%); POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS (89%); ELECTIONS (89%); SCANDALS (89%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (89%); POLITICS (89%); VOTERS & VOTING (86%); POLITICAL PARTIES (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (75%); PETITIONS (64%); TERRORISM (50%); INTERNET & WWW (50%),"Only we the people can take a stand. The most dangerous thing about all the corruption scandals in the news in recent months is that they have become so routine that the public may soon react with a yawn. A friend who was an editor in Uganda in the early 1990s tells me that in those days, when there was still a lot of hope in the Museveni team, any Page One story about high-level graft would cause a sensation. In time, the public became numbed. Hope in the administration ebbed away as happens with any government that stays in power for too long.  These days in Kampala, he says, when you run a Page One story about corruption the public wonders: So what's new? They have grown to expect the plunder of their nation by those in power. Kenya could soon enter that club if we are not careful. Witness, for example, the fact that the detailed front page story in this newspaper last week about the plot to grab a piece of land near State House did not draw any reactions at all. Yet citizens can do more than just lament that their tax money is being stolen with impunity. They can instead choose the path of tactical activism as the South Koreans did in 2000. The population of that country was tired of a class of politicians -- in government and opposition -- who were indistinguishable from one another and were united in serving their own interests and those of big business. So a coalition of 500 public interest groups came together and formed the Citizens' Alliance for the 2000 General Election (CAGE). The group decided to compile a list of dozens of candidates from all the political parties who had been credibly named in various scandals and were standing in legislative elections scheduled for April 2000. They took advantage of the growing use of the internet among the population and launched a petition urging voters to reject the candidates who were demonstrably ""corrupt, lazy, incompetent"" and ""unfit"" for high office. The campaign drew worldwide attention. It was, one diplomat said, ""the most interesting political movement in Asia since the People Power revolution in the Philippines in the 1980s"" (which ended decades of dictatorship). The political parties were furious. They united in denouncing the list as an act of ""political terrorism"" and demanded that action be taken against its promoters. South Korea's electoral body sided with the parties, but it had to backtrack in the face of strong grassroots support for the initiative, with polls showing 80 per cent backing of the CAGE list.  LOST SEATS The campaign worked. A remarkable 59 of 86 of the candidates who had been designated for rejection by the electorate lost their seats. The South Korean case has been cited since as a powerful example of peaceful people power shaping a society for the better and helping to hold the elite to account. There is no reason why Kenya, with its deep civic traditions, young, mobilised population and relatively high access to the internet can't replicate this success. The key lies in having credible grassroots movements which can take the lead in campaigning against graft to save future generations from crushing poverty. As former Treasury PS, Joseph Kinyua said the country loses about Sh300 billion every year in corrupt deals. Imagine what that money could  do for the people. It would be dangerous to sink to the level when reportage on major corruption scandals draws only a shrug of the shoulder. No political party can lecture another on corruption in Kenya today essentially because all sides must mysteriously raise around Sh6 billion for their campaigns. Only we the people can take a stand. Citizens can set up something like Ufisadi (Corruption) Watch and mount a campaign against individuals implicated in abuse of office and try to defeat them or at least embarrass them into changing their ways. This can range from those who  demand ""nipe nikupe"" services from their secretaries, those who grab playgrounds, those who maltreat police officers and parliamentarians who auction committees to the highest bidder. The great advantage the South Koreans have, however, is that they are one people without the ethnic divisions and ""our people"" syndrome which would be the greatest obstacle to such united action. mutiganews@gmail.com"248,Daily Nation (Kenya),3/14/2015,EDITORIAL: Corruption: President must walk the talk,,KENYA (92%),1144,Newspaper,EDITORIAL -1,ENGLISH,,14-Mar-15,"NAIROBI, KENYA (79%)",666  words,CORRUPTION (93%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (90%); CAMPAIGN FINANCE (84%); ELECTIONS (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); BRIBERY (78%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (78%); HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS (78%); HEALTH CARE (75%); PRIMARY SCHOOLS (75%); INFLATION (74%); ECONOMIC NEWS (74%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (74%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (70%); LAPTOP COMPUTERS (70%); MISDEMEANORS (69%); PRIME MINISTERS (63%),"The President must take urgent action. President Uhuru Kenyatta has in the past few days issued a stern warning to holders of high office involved in corruption. It was not the first such proclamation the President was making. Warnings to public officials about graft have become a running theme of Mr Kenyatta's speeches on  this subject.  The President should know that it is high time he moved beyond rhetoric and began to take action. Corruption is arguably the greatest impediment to Kenya's progress. Before the Goldenberg scandal, many services in hospitals and schools were free, and dispensaries in nearly all corners of the country were well stocked. That scandal sent the economy into a free fall and, by the mid-to-late 1990s, petty crime was commonplace, and crucial institutions like free public healthcare and agricultural extension services were no more. President Kibaki promised high-level action against corruption. His inaugural speech at Uhuru Park was one of the most ringing rallying cries against grand corruption this region has known. Unfortunately, the new administration was long on promises and short on action. The Anglo Leasing scandal, which broke out even as Narc was settling into power, punctured all the early euphoria that had seen wananchi arresting policemen extorting bribes from operators of public transport vehicles. Mr Kenyatta has arguably fared worse. The signature promise of the Jubilee team, the delivery of laptops to pupils entering primary school -- a promise which was all along of dubious sustainability and whose budgeting implications were doubtful from the start -- collapsed amid jostling to supply the laptops among well-connected Jubilee-linked businessmen. From then on, there have been mounting reports of tender inflation and influence peddling with other arms of government, particularly Parliament, also seemingly swimming in the mire. The President must take urgent action because he himself has admitted that some of the biggest corruption cartels are to be found in his Harambee House office. Failure to act will feed claims that he is helpless and,  therefore, ineffective or that he and his Deputy President are turning a blind eye to reward supporters. More broadly, a national conversation is necessary to address some of the structural issues that feed grand corruption. Top on the list is the campaign financing model. According to the Coalition for Accountable Political Financing (CAPF), a Nairobi-based think-tank, President Mwai Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga spent about Sh6 billion on their presidential bids in 2007 -- and that only involved money that could easily be traced. The analysts estimated that the Kenyatta and Odinga campaigns required up to Sh9 billion each for the March 2013 elections. These are staggering sums by any standards. The model has to change. The proposal under the Campaign Finance Bill mooted in 2011 for caps on campaign spending is unrealistic and can easily be sidestepped. Instead, it might be better to adopt a voluntary donations model which would see Kenyans contribute money to back their preferred candidates instead of the current situation where well-connected businessmen bankroll candidates in return for future favours. To achieve this, political parties should be strengthened and should adopt grassroots members-based models to encourage an attachment to the parties' platforms and therefore help them fashion a fund-raising mechanism such as membership fees. This would be a more sustainable model than having campaigns that are in the debt of a few shadowy and immensely wealthy figures. Secondly, President Kenyatta must ensure that in making key appointments, such as in the looming shake-up of parastatals, merit is the watchword. Appointing political cronies does not encourage an approach to spending taxpayers' money which puts the public good first. Mr Kenyatta's words imply he knows the scale of the problem. The time has come to move from rhetoric to action."249,Daily Nation (Kenya),3/16/2015,Uhuru needs to find extraordinary methods to deal with corruption,,BRAZIL (79%); KENYA (77%),1144,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,17-Mar-15,"NAIROBI, KENYA (77%)",443  words,CORRUPTION (90%); PUBLIC FINANCE (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (89%); BRIBERY (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (76%); LAWYERS (73%); WEALTHY PEOPLE (73%),"When Kanu was baba na mama, only a few could steal with impunity. However, low level corruption was rampant. The economy was in permanent reverse gear; tax collection was dismal, hence there was little money to steal.  Then came Kibaki with his policy of delegation, and ministers started becoming overnight billionaires. But the economy and tax collection improved, so there was more money to satisfy greedy parasites. Indeed, corruption was the root cause of the post election violence since Kenyans wrongly thought that with their tribesmen in power, they could get more than their fair share of the national cake. 2008 violence After the 2008 violence, we settled for a nusu mkate (power sharing) government, where the two sides competed to steal from the public coffers. Everyone was eating and happy, with no one seeing, hearing or talking evil. We rewrote the Constitution with the main objective of neutering the ""imperial presidency"". We created many centres of power, in the naive belief that they wouldŒæ keep each other on the straight and narrow. IMPECCABLE INTEGRITY We did not carefully consider how to ensure that only persons of impeccable integrity would become our leaders. And the Constitution did not include mechanisms for quickly removing inept and corrupt leaders from office. Corruption has now become endemic. From the low level corruption, we now have mega deals of billions of shillings. The most bizarre occurrence is that public officials now bribe other public officials, using their ill gotten money, to avoid prosecution. In our case, we cannot differentiate the thief from the gatekeeper. President Kenyatta should watch carefully the events which are unfolding in Brazil, since he may be next in line unless he slays the dragon of corruptionŒæ before it engulfs him. I sympathise with him, however, since he can only operate within the confines of laws that are weighted heavily in favour of the corrupt. Those who steal use their filthy loot to hire clever lawyers, and bribe their way to freedom. It is naive for us to expect the President to eradicate corruption using the same useless methods that have never yielded a single successful prosecution. If we had a Meles Zenawi, or a Paul Kagame, he could eradicate corruption in weeks, with culprits facing the firing squad, and others being incarcerated for long periods. The President should form a multi disciplinary commission to carefully analyse the corruption industry, and then formulate unorthodox but highly effective methods of eradicating the vice. The circus by EACC, DPP, courts, clever lawyers, and Parliament is simply unacceptable. BEN NJENGA.

It started off with the suspension of the deputy CEO by the commission, quickly revoked by the CEO the following day. Then accusations started flying, first against the chairman and other commissioners, and later against the CEO and his deputy. The Office of the President weighed in to inform the public that a petition signed by two commissioners against the chairman had been received in September 2014. The two commissioners disowned the petition, stating that they were misled.  After a week of back-and-forth, the commission and the CEO announced that they had resolved the sticking issues that had led to the public spat. They said they would work together and that the deputy CEO's suspension had been lifted. It later emerged that the deputy CEO had agreed to go on leave as investigations carried out. It is now public knowledge that Parliament has received a petition seeking the investigation and possible removal of the chairman and vice-chair of the commission. It remains to be seen what action Parliament will take. READ: ANGLO LEASING PROBE TO BLAME FOR EACC FALLOUT In all this drama, one thing is clear: serious allegations have been levelled against commissioners and senior officers of the commission. These allegations should be investigated fully and expeditiously, if the image of the commission is to be redeemed. The saga brings to mind eerie memories of the disbandment of the Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority (Kaca). Then, as now, trouble for the authority started when it took a powerful figure to court. In what seemed to be well-choreographed processes, Kaca was swiftly disbanded. This history informed the contentious inclusion of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission under Chapter Six of the Constitution of Kenya 2010; to forestall future attempts to disband the commission should it grow teeth and be seen as a threat to corruption syndicates. SERIOUS QUESTIONS Some serious questions come to mind: Are there powerful forces bent on using EACC's current tribulations to annihilate it? Are senior personalities at the commission beholden to political and corruption cartels? Could the commission's recent investigations have touched a raw nerve among powerful circles? The serious allegations levelled against officials at the commission should be thoroughly investigated by an independent entity and anyone found culpable dealt with in accordance with the law.  However, it is also important to consider the possibility that the allegations of impropriety could be an excuse to intimidate or even kill the commission -- a classic case of burning the house to kill a rat. Institutions act through individuals. Culpability is personalised. Wrongs are committed by individual officers. Those alleged to be gatekeeping for corruption interests should be investigated and punished and the commission left alone to continue its work. Kenyans must be vigilant and demand accountability from all institutions, while at the same time being alert to any forces that may want to weaken or kill institutions of accountability. That is why the February 27 judgment of the High Court that the mandate of the Commission on Administrative Justice is only limited to advisory and unenforceable recommendations is alarming and should be appealed. An independent audit of the work of the EACC should also be carried out. Kenyans need to understand why a commission that is mandated to fight corruption is unable to recover stolen assets and mete out punishment to the thieves of public wealth in a country where most public procurements are tainted by corruption. The fight against corruption cannot succeed if there is impunity for those who steal public funds. We must move beyond generalised condemnations of institutions and hold individual officers responsible for their misdeeds. Accountability at individual, unit, or departmental level must build up to accountability at the institutional level. This will make it possible to strengthen public institutions and protect them from powerful forces that may want to destroy them.

The number of the so-called tender wars are on the rise. Indeed, procurement disputes registered either in the High Court or at the Procurement Oversight Authority have escalated to unprecedented levels.  The hearings of these proceedings provide valuable insights into the games being played by the corrupt elite. The fact that cases of land-grabbing are back in the headlines is another pointer. It would appear that the targetsŒæfor the corruption cartels are the leases owned by Kenyan-Asians, especially the ones held by immigrants who no longer live in the country and which are about to expire. The on-going controversy over the ownership of Caxton House is a good example. The Lang'ata Road Primary School saga is another. And, away from the limelight is an explosive dispute over the ownership of Integrity House, which houses the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. Anecdotal evidence gathered from disappointed contractors also point to an upsurge of graft. Admittedly, what a disappointed foreign contractor tells you about how he lost out in a deal is not always true. Some of it is pure sour grapes. However, in my many years as a journalist, I have come to realise that disappointed contractors are among the best whistleblowers. They give you good insights into the activities of influential corrupt individuals. It is through the disappointed contractor that you get to know the size of the bribes that corrupt government officials demand. From what I gather from big contractors these days, it would appear that the corrupt are demanding inordinately large kickbacks. I sometimes wonder whether these greedy people appreciate the damage they do to the reputation of this country when they demand big bribes from foreigners, who do not keep secrets. Suddenly, you will find that Kenya's ranking on some bribery perception index compiled by some nondescript anti-corruption watchdog operating in some Western capital has soared. IT IS POLITICS STUPID But perhaps the biggest blowŒæto our international reputation right now are the shenanigans surrounding both the Public Accounts Committee and the Ethics and Anti- Corruption Commission. When you have a situation where the institutions created to fight corruption are the ones being investigated for graft, it tells you that the vice has reached endemic levels. As was the case in the times of Jesus Christ, the money-changers have taken over both our temples -- the National Assembly and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission.  When members of key parliamentary committees publicly trade accusations over bribery allegations, it is a statement about the extent to which corrupt networks have captured this key oversight institution. It is also a statement about the ease with which influence can be bought in our National Assembly. President Uhuru Kenyatta has been honest enough to accept that corruption is on the increase. Such an admission, coming from the top leadership of the country, shows that we no longer want to bury our heads in the sand. But why are we in this difficult situation? It is politics, stupid. It is because of lack of a powerful centre and the fact that many Cabinet and principal secretaries have come to believe that they are insulated from disciplinary action. Since the centre appears to be weak and disorganised, parastatal headsŒæ have found room to engage in freelanceŒærent-seeking activities. These days, no large procurement project is concluded without allegations of corruption. Sending some big fish to jail may help, but the emphasis must be put on reforming the system. As we have learned, Huduma centresŒæ can help reduce the need for bribes for things such as licences and identity cards. You create overlapping bureaucracies to provide the same service. Because you can have your identity card or driving licence replaced at the multiple Huduma centres, you do not have to payŒæthose petty bribes to civil servants. At times, I feel that we do not give adequate attention to the type of corruption that affects the ordinary man and woman. I think we should consider creating multipleŒælow-level tribunals and ombudsmen to come to the aid of ordinary citizens faced with routine bribery demands. jkisero@ke.nationmedia.com"252,Daily Nation (Kenya),3/19/2015,"Declare corruption a national disaster, says ACK Archbishop",,KENYA (96%),1144,Newspaper,OUMA WANZALA -1,ENGLISH,,20-Mar-15,,320  words,CORRUPTION (97%); RELIGION (96%); ETHICS (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); WAR & CONFLICT (78%); CANCER (52%),"President Kenyatta must take charge of war on corruption, says Archbishop Eliud Wabukala.

British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has said the Kenyan government needs to tackle corruption as it will slow the country's economic growth. Mr Hammond, who met with Kenyan business leaders, said thriving corruption will harm the economy regardless of how well sectors perform.  ""The problem with corruption anywhere is that it is damaging to the economy. It is a huge tax to the economy. It is a tax on business, it deters investment,"" he said during a meeting in Nairobi. Mr Hammond told a gathering of representatives from the Kenyan and British chambers of commerce that despite policy changes to improve ease of doing business, corruption remains the biggest headache. ""Defeating corruption will send an incredibly important signal to business. It will help business to thrive, it will encourage investment and it will ensure that the fruits are spread more equitably and more fairly."" FIGHT CORRUPTION Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed argued Kenya was giving priority to improving the business environment and corruption is one of the issues. ""Corruption is not unique to Kenya and therefore it is not an issue of criticism to Kenya. It is about working to overcome the menace. ""The ease of doing business has just improved tremendously. I will tell you for sure that a lot of effort has been invested to fight corruption,"" she said. The British Foreign Secretary is visiting Kenya for the first time since President Kenyatta's government came to power. His visit comes at a time when the National Assembly, the Ethics and anti-Corruption Commission and several senior government officials are facing integrity questions over their conduct. Last week, envoys of the UK, US and Switzerland issued a joint statement cautioning that corruption would drain economic gains Kenya has made. At the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, top officials have clashed over corruption cases under investigation. Also in the spotlight are Cabinet Secretary for Energy Davies Chirchir and top electoral commission officials, including chairman Ahmed Issack Hassan, over the ""Chicken"" scandal. The National Assembly is also on the spotlight, with members of parliamentary committees being accused to taking bribes from subjects under investigation to write favourable reports. ETHICAL STANDARDS President Kenyatta has issued an executive order in which he complained about widespread corruption among State and public servants.  ""My office continues to receive numerous briefs, reports and complaints from citizens of blatant breaches of ethical standards, pilferage and outright theft involving civil servants, State and public officers. ""These unsavoury, unethical and corrupt practices continue to thrive in spite of various reminders and warnings,"" the President said. But Mr Hammond expressed hope that Kenya's efforts in fighting corruption may bear fruit. ""The Jubilee government has made an important commitment to improve the business environment and I applaud President Kenyatta in his call to all Kenyans in eradicating corruption.

Cord leader Raila Odinga has accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of sleeping on the job in the fight against corruption. Mr Odinga paints a grim picture of the country's anti-graft campaign, saying it was apparent that the institutions that are supposed to tackle the vice had failed.  He says despite highly publicised declarations by the President that corrupt government officials will be punished, no action had been taken against those implicated in multi-million-shilling scandals and powerful individuals accused of grabbing public land. In an interview with the Sunday Nation at his Opoda home in Siaya County on Saturday, the opposition chief said the Jubilee leadership was playing public relations with corruption which had morphed into a ""national crisis"". ""There is no commitment to fight corruption by the top Jubilee leadership. The cancer continues to spread but there has not been any attempt to address the matter since the Jubilee Government took over,"" said Mr Odinga who described President Kenyatta's executive as ""rotten"". His argument is that an executive whose members have a history of corruption or are involved in the vice cannot be trusted to lead the anti-graft campaign. According to Mr Odinga, failure by the President to take concrete action had fuelled corruption mainly in government tenders and grabbing of public land whose leases were expiring. ""We are experiencing a complete system failure. The Executive is rotten. The Legislature is more rotten. The anti-corruption commission is rotten. It is a dangerous situation,"" he said in the morning interview. ARE BENEFICIARIES According to Mr Odinga, the Jubilee coalition was incapable of tackling corruption because its members are beneficiaries. Secondly, the Opposition leader thinks that the Uhuru-Ruto Government is glaringly incompetent, low on substance but strong in public relations. ""On PR and propaganda I will give them an A-minus. On substance and delivery of things that can improve the lives of Kenyans, I give them a D-plus,""ŒæMr Odinga said. He called for the disbandment of the Mumo Matemu-led Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission saying it had failed to deliver on its mandate. The commission has been entangled in wrangles lately with two of its commissioners petitioning the President to sack Mr Matemu for alleged malpractice. However, Mr Odinga faulted the move, saying the commissioners should have petitioned Parliament to set up a tribunal to probe the matter.  ""The commission is supposed to be independent of the President. By writing to him, Œæthe commissioners were suggesting that the commission takes instructions from the Executive."" The former Prime Minister said that being a businessman, the President is ""fully aware"" of the corruption networks in government that were brokering kickbacks in mega contracts. ""The President is not naí¿ve. I have told him that his legacy will be based on his performance. Not rhetoric. It is not enough to give warnings. He accepted that there was corruption in his office and declared that heads will roll. No heads have rolled."" Just this month, the President repeated that corrupt government officials will be dealt with. Earlier in January, President Kenyatta sounded a warning to inept and corrupt public officers saying they will be fired. He cautioned that laziness and graft would not be entertained and that those not willing to work hard were free to go home. ""There are so many young and educated Kenyans who are willing to replace such government officers,"" he said. And as part of his effort to address graft in public tendering, the President on March 6 ordered that matters of procurement be handled online to ensure transparency and ordered an audit of tenders awarded for the two years that Jubilee has been in power. Mr Odinga spoke amidst concerns by key voices in the private sector, international community and civil society about what appears to be unprecedented high levels of corruption in government but also disturbing official inaction. Members of the civil society and trade unions have threatened mass action if the President does not come up with a strategy to fight runaway graft. They claim that 20 mega scandals have been reported in two years of the Jubilee Administration. WALK THE TALK Anglican Bishop Eliud Wabukala, who chairs the National Anti-Corruption Campaign steering committee, on Friday asked President Kenyatta to walk the talk on corruption. ""The level of corruption being witnessed in government is only comparable to the 1990s during the Kanu era,"" said anti-graft crusader and former Ethics Permanent Secretary John Githongo who was a critical player in exposing the Anglo Leasing scandal during the President Mwai Kibaki administration. In the interview on Saturday, Mr Odinga also accused the Jubilee Coalition of selective prosecution of Anglo-Leasing suspects, saying some individuals with a strong relationship with the Kanu regime had been left out. Mr Odinga has questioned what he calls reluctance by the Jubilee Government to prosecute election officials involved in the Chickengate scandal involving bribery by a British printing firm whose managers have since been jailed. To address corruption, he suggests reforms in the public service, security sector and implementation of Agenda Four issues identified by the Kofi-Annan panel in 2008, mainly creation of jobs for the youth. The other is strict implementation of the Constitution, particularly Article 10, which demands that only people of integrity be entrusted with public offices. 'A HUGE TAX' British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond on Friday warned that unless tackled, corruption will slow economic growth. ""The problem with corruption anywhere is that it is damaging to the economy. It is a huge tax to the economy. It is a tax on business, it deters investment."" ""Defeating corruption will send an incredibly important signal to business. It will help business to thrive, it will encourage investment and it will ensure that the fruits are spread more equitably and more fairly."" On Saturday, Mr Odinga said that members of the private sector had raised concern with him that corruption had increased the cost of doing business in Kenya. He said that investors have to bribe members of the Executive for award of tenders, the Judiciary in case of court cases arising from tender disputes and committees of Parliament purporting to be investigating issues relating to the contracts. ""The MPs who pretend to be investigating the tenders are only looking for a cut. They give approval after their hands have been greased,"" Mr Odinga said. He claimed that members of key House committees were being bribed by forces in the Executive to stop investigations into the theft of taxpayers' money. ""The focus should be on the individual in the Executive who is throwing money at members of the Public Accounts Committee in order not to be mentioned adversely in investigations."" The former Prime Minister was making reference to claims in Parliament that members of the committee chaired by ODM secretary-general Ababu Namwamba were bribed to shield a senior government official. But Mr Odinga was uncomfortable with suggestions that having been accused of bribery in House committees, Cord MPs -- including Mr Namwamba -- had no moral authority to raise questions on corruption. ""That is nonsense. A majority of the MPs in the committees are from the ruling coalition,"" he said. However, Mr Odinga could not hide his excitement over the Kajiado by-election, which his party won despite a spirited and highly-oiled campaign by the Jubilee coalition. But he strongly thinks that Jubilee should not have fielded a candidate in Kajiado having ""poached"" Mr Joseph Nkaissery of ODM for appointment as a Cabinet Secretary. He argues that ODM should have been given a free hand to retain their seat. ""It was an act of terrible bad faith but the Kajiado people taught them a lesson, that we in ODM stand for bigger things than public appointments and false promises of development."" The seat was won by ODM's Elijah Memusi against Jubilee's Patrick Tutui."255,Daily Nation (Kenya),3/23/2015,"KISERO: To beat corruption networks, we must strengthen our financial management",,KENYA (92%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%),1144,Newspaper,JAINDI KISERO -1,ENGLISH,,24-Mar-15,,721  words,INTERNAL AUDITS (91%); AUDITS (91%); TREASURY DEPARTMENTS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); ACCOUNTING (89%); BOARDS OF DIRECTORS (78%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (77%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (76%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (72%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (50%),"The other day, the Cabinet decided that internal auditors will now report to the Cabinet secretaries of their specific ministries. This is a glaring manifestation of lack of appreciation of the proper place and role of auditing in an organisation.  Is it not the height of irony that we have been shouting about corruption, then refuse to allow auditors to operate independently? Even in the corporate world, the internal audit function ultimately reports to the board's audit committee. Why are we changing from the system where all internal auditors in the civil service reported to the National Treasury? Where is the evidence that the current system, where all economists report to the Ministry of Planning and Devolution and all procurement officers to the National Treasury, has failed? Where is the research and analytics to justify these haphazard changes? I have always maintained that the war against corruption will not be won by merely locking up all the big fish in jail.ŒæWe live in a society where corruption is related to political patronage. One of the major things that bestows political legitimacy is how one sharesŒæthe proceeds of corruption with cronies and supporters on activities such as harambees. Thus, although an anti-corruption strategy based on throwing people into jail is good at giving the populace emotional gratification and a sense of closure, in reality, it cannot take us very far. Considering that corruption in this country is systemic, we may find ourselves staggering under the weight of packed jails. Imagine having to throw in all members of parliamentary committees! Instead, we must concentrate on strengthening and modernisingŒæ institutions of accountability -- procurement procedures, internal audit systems, parliamentary oversight institutions, the Judiciary, the Ombudsman, the Directorate of Public Prosecutions, and the Office of the Attorney General. HIGH PRIORITY Corruption is on the upsurge in this country because public financial management and accountability has historically not been a high priority. There was a time when the person in charge of public financial management carried the designation ""principal finance and establishment officer"". These people had no training in finance and accounting. On the advice of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the position was abolished and replaced by the cadre known as ""finance officers"", most of whom were former district commissioners with no professional training in accounting and finance.  Today, the National Treasury is basically run by economists. There are very few qualified accountants in the employ of the institution charged with running our public financial management systems. Mr Martin Oduor Otieno is the only professional accountant to have served as permanent secretary at the Treasury. The rest were either former district commissioners or economists. Truth be told, public financial management in Kenya is weak. Why do I say so? Because public financial management is about recording, classifying, analysing, and reporting. In South Africa, every ministry is required to produce audited accounts three months after year-end. In Kenya, you would be lucky to see a ledger of all assets owned by a government ministry. How often do we come across the consolidated accounts of the whole government? Yet we all know that financial reporting is the heart of financial management. Today, the government touts the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) as a major success. Yet it is well known that in terms of generating information critical to financial management, IFMIS is way inferior when compared to core banking systems which most banks use or enterprise resource planning (ERP), which many corporate companies use. Why is the government finding it difficult to institute a system that centralises procurement of common user items? Considering its size, the government should be purchasing common user items way below market rates. I read that in the United States, the General Service Administration purchases common user items for the government at 30 per cent below market rate. Our supplies branch at the department of Public Works became moribund several years ago. Let us put public finance management at the top of the agenda. jkisero@ke.nationmedia.com"256,Daily Nation (Kenya),3/25/2015,"Stop exam cheating, lest children think corruption is the norm",,KENYA (69%); INDIA (52%),1144,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,26-Mar-15,"NAIROBI, KENYA (69%)",225  words,SCHOOL CHEATING (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (90%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (78%),"Stephen Muthini's letter, ""In impressive KCSE results, there's reason to smile and worry"" -- Nation, March 25 -- echoes my sentiments.

Even with all this effort, I did not score A, for the grade was reserved for a few. The highest one or two students scored A-, a few had Bs and the majority Cs. Fast forward to 2014 and 80 per cent of the students are passing exams so highly both at primary and secondary levels. A lecturer at a university in Nairobi lamented that the same students who scored As were struggling to pass university exams, and academic performance had deteriorated over the years. A trend is swiftly creeping into our education system where students seem to be excelling in exam cheating. A story by the BBC last year suggests that students in India feel they have a right to cheat. The rich can bribe their way to examination success. I'm not suggesting that all students who have excelled are to be questioned; some of them worked tirelessly and scored impressive grades.

He urged the other arms of government such as the legislature and the Judiciary to do the same. SURPRISE MOVE The President's surprise move on corruption won a standing ovation in Parliament as MPs from both sides thunderously cheered him. (READ: Uhuru's State of the Nation speech - as it happened) Earlier, the President mentioned various parliamentary committees, the EACC and the judicial system of undermining the war against graft in the country by engaging in activities that undermined the government operation against graft. Some of the key figures recently featured in cases under investigations by the EACC include the chairman of the IEBC, Ahmed Issack Hassan, and the Energy Cabinet Secretary Davies Chirchir who are both mentioned in the Chickengate scandal. Two weeks ago, the President warned that persons involved in corruption in his government would be expelled from government. In his address, the President also announced he was initiating a restorative process in the country by offering a State apology for all wrongs and ills committed against Kenyans by his government and the past regime. The President's apology is in line with a recommendation in the Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission report which was handed over to him in 2013. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE He announced a Sh10 billion fund to support the restorative justice similar to the one started in the post-apartheid South Africa after the African National Congress took over power. The President took advantage of his State of the Nation address in Parliament on Thursday to enumerate various achievements by his government as he begins second anniversary in office. President Kenyatta, whose administration has been accused by the opposition for abetting corruption and exposing the country to high levels of insecurity, told Kenyans that his government had made tremendous gains in enabling a strong economic growth since he came to power. He said his government would now increase the number of recruits to the country's National Police Service to 10,000 as part of a major plan to face insecurity concerns head on. His speech touched on a number of issues and sectors including the economic growth, development in the energy sector, healthcare systems, the standard gauge railway and the digital television migration among others."258,Daily Nation (Kenya),3/26/2015,Raila faults Uhuru move on corruption,,KENYA (97%),1144,Newspaper,NATION REPORTER -1,ENGLISH,,28-Mar-15,,219  words,CORRUPTION (96%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (90%); COUNTIES (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%); SCANDALS (77%); ETHICS (72%); ELECTION AUTHORITIES (66%),"Cord leader calls President's speech a ""hypocritical lamentation"".

The appointment of Chris Okemo as a board member of the Kenya Seed Company has been termed a mockery of the fight against corruption in Kenya. Mr Okemo was appointed to the board of the parastatal two weeks ago in what is seen as an attempt by Jubilee government to win the hearts and minds ofŒæwestern Kenyan voters in readiness for 2017 General Election.  Mr Okemo is wanted in Jersey, UK, for allegedly defrauding the Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) Sh900 million and laundering the money in Jersey. Together with former KPLC managing director Samuel Gichuru, they have, for the last three years, contested the Island of Jersey's extradition orders at the High Court in Nairobi. Former Ethics and Governance Permanent Secretary John Githongo says that Mr Okemo's appointment was an insult to ""all Kenyans fighting corruption"". He wondered how the government can appoint a man with an international warrant of arrest. ""The appointment is a mockery to all Kenyans in their efforts to fight corruption. It is an insult to the people of Kenya to appoint a man who has an international warrant of arrest. The gentleman can't even travel. Where can he go? This is just impunity and an insult to Kenyans,"" says Mr Githongo. 'SCANDALOUS' International Centre for Policy and Conflict (ICPC) Director Ndung'u Wainaina termed the move by President Uhuru Kenyatta to appoint Mr Okemo scandalous. ""His appointment is such a scandalous and huge public disappointment. It confirms the contradictions of the Uhuru Kenyatta presidency. Broad statements of the value of integrity, transparency, accountability and ethics gain general agreement from all sides of politics and public debate,"" says Mr Wainaina. Mr Wainaina argues that government's integrity demands more than issuing executive orders. ""It demands more than general expressions of goodwill. Enhancing transparency and accountability requires supportive structures and cultivating ethical behaviour needs more than simple, sweeping statements of expectations. Integrity in government and in politics is more than simply a declaration of the importance of individuals behaving ethically,"" says Mr Wainaina. In Jersey, the two are wanted for false declarations, fraud and money laundering. The court documents state that they misled auditors of Wartsila that Windward Trading was receiving consultation fees. ""The charges were in fact inflated to meet or recover the cost of making corrupt payments to his Jersey company, Windward Ltd,"" state the court documents.  The warrants say that Okemo opened bank accounts in Jersey under his name and Arus Management service where the funds were deposited between August 1, 2000 and August 3, 2001. The two individuals were summoned to the Island of Jersey court on April 20, 2011 and subsequently on May 5, 2011 but failed to show up. They are wanted on 53 counts of money laundering and fraud. The funds were allegedly paid as commissions to Mr Gichuru and Mr Okemo who were powerful individuals in former President Moi's government. Mr Okemo was Energy minister from 1999 to 2001 and then Finance minister from 2001 to 2003 while Mr Gichuru was KPLC managing director from 1983 to 2003. According to court documents the volume and value of payments to Windward increased dramatically from January 1997. The accounts were frozen. ""The evidence proves that Gichuru's method of committing the offence involved inflation of the contract price. Okemo and Gichuru conspired together to enable Okemo receive into his bank account in Jersey, property, namely, funds credited to the said bank account following transfers from Windward Trading and Arus Management Services, knowing the same have been acquired by Samuel Gichuru by conduct outside Jersey which, had it occurred in Jersey, would have amounted to an offence, namely misconduct in public office and fraud"" state the court documents. Last week, KNCHR called on Mr Kenyatta to revoke Mr Okemo's appointment."260,Daily Nation (Kenya),3/28/2015,EDITORIAL: War on corruption must be stepped up,,KENYA (97%),1144,Newspaper,EDITORIAL -1,ENGLISH,,29-Mar-15,,304  words,CORRUPTION (93%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); SCANDALS (78%); POLITICS (78%); ETHICS (73%),"Kenyans have been demanding that the President confront the corruption monster. President Uhuru Kenyatta has taken a bold move in the fight against corruption. Already, five Cabinet secretaries and a number of principal secretaries have left office after they were named in the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission list he presented in his State of the Nation address to both houses of Parliament last Thursday.  On Tuesday, Parliament is expected to make public the full list, which is said to include scores of senior officials. Our hope is that all those under suspicion will have the decency to quietly step aside while due process takes its course. It is important to point out that being under investigation is not an indication of guilt. Temporarily leaving office serves to ensure that the person under scrutiny is not in a position to tamper with likely evidence or otherwise interfere with investigation. For a long time, Kenyans have been demanding that the President confront the corruption monster. Perceptions have built up that the Jubilee coalition administration was not only soft on graft, but was actually presiding over the return of mega corruption reminiscent of the Goldenberg and Anglo Leasing scandals of past administrations. It is unfortunate, however, that some are already employing political manoeuvres to get themselves off the hook. Legitimate questions can be raised about the process employed and the authenticity of the list. However, these queries can be raised in a manner that does not indicate crass politics of opportunism or efforts to sabotage the anti-corruption war. What we would want is that the war is stepped up, not slowed down, and that it proceeds to nail and punish all corruption officials irrespective of political persuasion, status in society, or family and business links."261,Daily Nation (Kenya),3/30/2015,List of Shame: Corruption laid bare,,KENYA (97%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%); AFRICA (56%),1144,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,1-Apr-15,"NAIROBI, KENYA (92%)",1418  words,INVESTIGATIONS (92%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CITIES (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); CONSTRUCTION (90%); URBAN DEVELOPMENT (90%); ECONOMIC NEWS (90%); HOUSING AUTHORITIES (89%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (89%); TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE (78%); REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT (78%); PASSPORTS & VISAS (78%); BRIBERY (78%); CITY GOVERNMENT (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (76%); SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES (76%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (76%); TRADE TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (75%); COUNTIES (75%); INFRASTRUCTURE (75%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (75%); POLICE FORCES (75%); CIVIL ENGINEERING (73%); CONSTRUCTION SECTOR PERFORMANCE (73%); EMBEZZLEMENT (72%); EXECUTIVES (71%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (68%); IMMIGRATION (65%); LICENSES & PERMITS (64%); HIGHWAYS & STREETS (53%); INTERNATIONAL TOURISM (50%),"Dossier documents graft, from the grand multi-billion shilling scams to the petty.

Parliament on Tuesday opened debate on the list of public officials under investigation over corruption cases. There was overwhelming support for President Uhuru Kenyatta, who submitted the list to Parliament last week and directed that it be debated while those implicated were asked to leave office pending investigations.  However, the list has sparked furious discussion, with critics faulting it as a smokescreen to hoodwink the public while no concrete action was being taken to deal with corruption. Except for Cabinet secretaries, principal secretaries, and some parastatal chiefs, others adversely mentioned in the report have stayed put. In particular, governors and other elected leaders whose names appear on the list have vowed not leave office. There is danger that too much heat is being generated at the expense of execution. Both the government and the opposition are seeking to score political goals instead of fighting corruption. For one, tabling and debating the list in Parliament does not add much value in the anti-corruption campaign because the House does not investigate or adjudicate cases. Second, questions have been raised about the process. Some of those being asked to leave office were never told about allegations made against them, which goes against the rule of natural justice. Corruption must be fought vigorously and decisively, but there is danger in politicising and trivialising the matter and missing the goal. Let the investigations be concluded expeditiously and those found culpable taken to court to answer to the charges. More importantly, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission must provide watertight evidence that can sustain the charges and restore confidence that it has the capacity to lead the war."263,Daily Nation (Kenya),3/31/2015,OBBO: Kenya's corruption war; the problem is as much the 'eating' as the how,,KENYA (95%); AFRICA (93%),1144,Newspaper,CHARLES ONYANGO-OBBO -1,ENGLISH,,2-Apr-15,,745  words,LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); POLITICS (90%); ELECTIONS (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (78%); CIVIL SERVICES (78%); BRIBERY (76%); ELECTION AUTHORITIES (70%); WAGES & SALARIES (69%),"A technocratic Cabinet was a structural reform to avoid the situation that Kenya is in. You never see these things coming. President Uhuru Kenyatta goes to Parliament to make a regular State of the Nation address, and indeed it starts as such. Then he drops the hammer, and asks government officials being investigated for corruption to step aside.  Matters would have ended there, and they have done in Kenya and elsewhere in Africa in the past. However, he then released the now famous ""List of Shame"", as Kenyans on Twitter quickly dubbed it, and the dominoes starting falling. So far, five members of his Cabinet have had to do the side dance. Though many have sniggered at the move as mostly symbolic, and most of the people on the list will be cleared and back in government and back to their old ways, clearly the public appetite for some corruption blood is high. Many people are excited and happy that the President did what he did. The List of Shame should, however, trouble us for bigger reasons. The Kenyatta Cabinet is technocratic, and one of the things the country's new Constitution sought to achieve by providing for a Cabinet of unelected politicians was to eliminate corruption and improve efficiency. ELECTORAL POLITICS All over Africa, we have come to the view that corruption in politics is primarily driven by electoral politics; political ministers collect bribes and steal public funds to pay off the debts of the last election, build a war chest for the next contest, and to keep their constituents happy, all things they cannot do from their salaries. Secondly, civil servants, fearing they will be sacked or demoted with the change of government at election, steal as a way of fast-forwarding their terminal benefits. However, we have seen that Cabinet secretaries, who have no constituencies to nurse, are on the List of Shame. Some, if not all, might be cleared, but the fact that the majority of Cabinet secretaries are not on the list means it was possible to avoid it. A technocratic Cabinet was a structural reform to avoid the situation that Kenya is in -- of serious progress against corruption happening only if the president as an individual stepped into the fight. So what else is left? My sense is that the outrage about corruption is not just over the ""eating"". Rather it is about outcomes. If, for example, the technology that the Interim Independent Electoral Commission bought for the 2013 polls had not failed so dismally, and had instead worked flawlessly, there would not have been so much anger at its cost, or at the commission.  LIKE WAR Secondly, too many times, public officials fail to understand that corruption is like war. You need to take contested territory, and then occupy it effectively. Thus, in the case of the standard gauge railway (SGR), the arguments against it and the queries about its cost have raced far ahead of the project. When Mwai Kibaki was president, in his last years he seemed to have appreciated this point. He just did not stand around fondling his golf clubs. By the time most people woke up to the scale of the Thika Road project, it was nearly half-done. From that point the critics of the design and cost of the Thika highway were playing rearguard action. Which goes back to our first point; that this would not have been done if all the Thika Road money had been chewed. In other words, you have to lay down a marker. If the SGR was nearing Malaba at the border with Uganda and there were photographs of villagers along its path dancing and celebrating its arrival, there would be a different conversation around it. Which leads us to our final point: People rail against corruption most when they are getting nothing and living through hard economic times and then see big men living large on their taxes. If the economy is growing and the benefits are been distributed fairly, there is less gripe about corruption. EVIL BONUS It would seem, then, that the people see corruption as an ""evil bonus"". The smaller people hate it more when the CEOs cut big cheques for themselves when the company is doing poorly and when they are getting a pittance or nothing. In other words, you have to earn your corrupt wage. Rather than trying to fill the State with angels, the more practical thing seems to have a competent government that delivers on projects, grows the economy, and divides the cake even-handedly.

There have been murmurs that President Kenyatta's focus on corruption was getting fuzzy, that his determination was waning, his commitment doubtful. However, he has taken the bold step of asking State officials suspected of involvement in corruption to stand down pending investigation into the allegations.  By doing so, the President has taken the risk of either destroying his political career or earning honours. Past attempts at fighting corruption have always failed. If the latest campaign follows that route, then Kenyans may never recover from the resulting disillusionment. It will mean that if you steal public funds, you only need to invoke the name of your tribe or clan, then hire several lawyers with your ill-gotten wealth to get you through a long court process. You will never be asked to return the money you stole and you can safely launder it in such innovative ways as investing in real estate. It will not be easy for the President to keep his focus on fighting corruption in this politically charged country where the next election is all that matters. As a minimum, he will need to demand that those working for him be without reproach. He will soon realise that it is lonely at the top, especially if you have to fire your top staff. He may want to borrow a leaf from Rwanda, where President Paul Kagame's anti-corruption strategy is to force those who steal public resources to return them, then face prosecution. REDEMPTION Of course, the President cannot be expected to undertake the task of fighting corruption alone. There must first be a thorough assessment of the capacity of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) and other relevant State institutions to ascertain that they are qualified and dedicated to eradicating graft. EACC must see the investigations through and make sure that those found culpable are prosecuted. The voices of civil society groups will grow louder against corruption. The opposition is on the lookout for bad news. A success for the President is bad news for the masters of corruption and for the opposition, which must now decide where it stands on this issue. A win will offer redemption on the institution of the presidency. President Kenyatta can even win back the political capital the government has lost due to the perception of ethnic exclusion. President Kenyatta's anti-corruption drive is dicey, comparable to when you realise that there is a snake under your bed. You can choose to snore the night away and risk having the reptile slithering into your bed or get up and kill it. This is not a moral war or even an ethical dilemma. It is a war on a criminal conspiracy against the nation. This is about the future of our children and a generation whose tomorrow is on the precipice. In attempting to tackle corruption, the President is also seeking a solution to insecurity as the two are intricately linked. Capitalism has placed great significance on the tag of success. Many people believe that one must strive to be prosperous at all costs to be termed successful. The problem with corruption as a means to prosperity is that it creates inequalities that lay the foundation for social seclusion. To defeat this, President Kenyatta has no option but to run the full race.

Mr Munya argued that most governors used their private cars for official duties after the elections yet he was the only one indicted. ""I was named because there are people fighting me politically.

The incentives that are built into the institutional framework play the decisive role in shaping the kind of skills and knowledge that pay off."" Case in point. When I was graduating from university, I cannot recall anyone wanting a career in procurement. Purchasing and supplies was a low status back office job that people ended up in by accident. Today, one out of three job applications I get from bright young people are for jobs in procurement. I think this tells us a lot about what has become of our institutions over the last three decades. What happens to a society where the dominant aspiration of its youth is to find opportunities to be corrupt? It should not surprised. This country was founded for, and built on, plunder. The colonialists came here empty-handed.  First, they grabbed land. Then they compelled African's into labour and suppressed wages. They prevented Africans from adopting high value crops and European cattle breeds so as to prevent them from competing with European produce and also to keep labour flowing to settler farms. By 1950, immigrants who accounted for less than 10 per cent of the population, commanded 50 per cent of the income. It is impossible to achieve this kind of income redistribution in a free market. The only way to do so was by means of the State.  Our institutional legacy from colonialism was a State designed to enrich and protect a privileged minority. Let us fast forward to 1972.  I am referring to the infamous Ndegwa Commission. The mandate of the commission was to rationalise civil service pay. Hitherto, pay in the public service was based on race. Europeans earned more than Asians, and Asians earned more than Africans in the same job. On this, it did a good job. But its legacy is the position it took on whether it was legitimate for civil servants to do business. The report began by acknowledging corruption: ""The achievement of independence in Kenya has brought with it great opportunities for individual advancement both as to main careers and in other less orthodox ways. It is understandable that public servants should have taken their opportunities like other citizens but if the benefits in some cases seem out to be out of proportion with other citizens, it is inevitable that questions be asked as to how this came about."" Still, it went on to draw the now infamous opinion: ""There ought in theory to be no objection to the ownership of property or involvement in businesses by members of the public services to the point where their wealth is augmented perhaps substantially by such activities."" It is commonly argued that this Ndegwa Commission is the root of our inordinately corrupted and corrupting state. I do not share this view for two reasons. First, as demonstrated by the first part of the excerpt, corruption was already rife.  Second, it is not at all evident that we are more corrupt than other African countries that did not adopt  similar policies. Some, like the DRC and Nigeria have been plundered more than we have. The contention seems to rest on a presumption that the counter-factual i.e., what would have happened otherwise, is that we would have progressed on the path of a modern market economy. This is improbable. The more likely scenario would have been State domination of the economy. The enterprises that the Kenyatta elite ""Africanised"" to themselves would have been nationalised instead. They would have been badly run and plundered. WEALTHIEST PEOPLE This is not to say that the declaration is benign. It may have been the lesser 40 years ago, but it is certainly  not the route to progress today. There is no civilised country where public service careers produce the wealthiest people in society. Recently, we have been entertained by police officers who have claimed that sudden large deposits in their bank accounts are perfectly legitimate business earnings. If a police officer can be such a good entrepreneur while employed full-time in such a time consuming job, how much better off would they be if they devoted all their time and energy to enterprise? And so would we -- they would create more jobs and pay taxes. There is no war without casualties and collateral damage. How would a real war on corruption in Kenya unfold? First, we have a national elite composed predominantly of people with no other skills other than finding opportunities to profit from the State. As North observes, fortunes in the United States are made in industry, not in Washington. I have heard some of our oligarchs compare themselves with the 19th and early 20th century American robber barons.  Nonsense. Vanderbilt, Carnegie, Rockefeller and all the other so called robber barons were phenomenal industrialists. They built railroads, steel plants, oil refineries and more. None of them was in government. Their notoriety was ruthlessness in business, not plundering the public purse. Our oligarchy, by contrast, has not build anything of substance. It is, as Fanon observed, ""not engaged in production, nor in invention, nor building, nor labour"" but rather in ""activities of the intermediary type"". Every so often, we get a glimpse of its fragility, such as the sudden demise of Mugoya, once the mightiest construction company in East Africa, and the more recent expose and subsequent implosion of CMC. There are few African ""old money"" fortunes in this country that would survive the end of graft and State patronage. Second, we have a public service where the only things that get done are those that further private interests, in plain language, the ones where people are eating. Suppose, for argument's sake, the President's war was to stop all the procurement rackets in their tracks, that from one day to the next, there would not be a single ""cut"" paid big and small alike?  Government spending would slow down to a trickle. We might even run budget surpluses for a year or two. Many property development projects would stall. High end private schools would suddenly find themselves struggling to fill classes. Shopping mall parking lots would empty, as would those of Nairobi's exclusive clubs. Of course in time, people would learn that the cheese has moved, and they would have no choice but to acquire new skills. Instead of honing chicken trapping skills, those whose appetites exceed the number of chickens that the public pay can afford would be compelled to learn how to rear chicken. But the transition would be painful. Not all plunderers would find poultry farming appealing.  They are used to easy money.  Institutionalised corruption is a form of organised crime. Many plunderers would transfer their skills to other forms of organised crime -- narcotics, bootlegging, people trafficking, poaching, smuggling and so on. And now a few words on the Presidents' war on corruption.  His sights, as far as we can see, are trained primarily on the procurement rackets in his government. It has been an open secret for several months that the President was losing grip of the government as even MPs and key operatives in his TNA wing of the coalition had jumped on the gravy train. Moreover, the political and the bureaucratic corruption networks have converged. Using corruption to fight political battles is a temptation that many leaders fall into. More often than not, it is counter-productive, resulting in loss of both the political and corruption wars. Prosecuting the corrupt is necessary but not sufficient. It is necessary because corruption is a crime and crime should be punished. That's a rule of law issue. But just like many other crimes, it does not end the committing of crimes. China routinely executives high profile people for corruption. A prominent businessman was executed in February. It does not seem to deter corruption. The EACC dossier the President tabled in Parliament suggests that Chinese contractors are in a league of their own. OPTIONS AVAILABLE Of the options available to him, the President in my view chose a bad one. As I pointed out in a previous column, the Constitution has shorn of the Presidency of most of the command and control authority it had accumulated under the old constitution. The President has no control of the institutions that he needs to prosecute his war on corruption. The clumsy handiwork displayed in the attempt to dismantle the EACC demonstrates this. The Anglo-leasers and the new barons have between them more than enough money to corrupt all these institutions. Goldenberg probably did more to destroy our old Judiciary than all other assaults on it put together. The political class will close ranks. It is already in election mode. It is not lost to them that the President does not have to fret about financing his campaign. I see at least two strategies that in my view would have been superior. The ideal would have been to build a very strong national consensus for it, say, by convening a national conference and getting all important constituencies -- the opposition, religious leaders, private sector, civil society and the media -- to sign on and own it. The challenge with this strategy though, is that the Jubilee government has spent the better part of the last two years burning its bridges with these constituencies. The second one would have been to limit his action to the domain of his authority. He could have fired his cabinet secretaries and bureaucrats and left it at that. He need not have declared a war.

Corruption has increased in the past one year and the National Police Service is the worst culprit, a survey has found. In addition, the public feels the government is not doing enough to fight the vice, according to the latest Afrobarometer survey.  The findings released in Nairobi on Tuesday show that seven out of 10 respondents think the government has handled the fight against corruption badly. The study was carried out between November and December last year, several months before President Uhuru Kenyatta tabled the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission report in Parliament that triggered the investigation of high-ranking government officials for corruption. However, looking at such ""momentary actions"" by  government officials and the immediate public opinion they elicit are not as important as considering the long-term impact of policy decisions, said Afrobarometer project manager for East Africa Abel Oyuke. ""These will easily move up and down depending on such government actions or inaction but quickly fade away. ""For that reason these results are not redundant, they are relevant and (we) expect (the government) to apply them to inform policy,"" he said. In the survey, the respondents said the ruling coalition had performed poorly in tackling corruption, but a majority (69 per cent) felt the government was doing better than  the Opposition could have done in the war against graft. The police, yet again, emerged as the most corrupt institution, with nearly one in three Kenyans admitting to have bribed an officer in the past year. Three out of four respondents said the police were corrupt. These findings fly in the face of the reforms aimed at giving Kenyans a more transparent police service. For instance, the vetting of senior officers has revealed that some individuals accumulated immense wealth not commensurate with their salaries. The study also puts the civil service on the spot, with 46 per cent saying it is corrupt. Also adversely mentioned are MPs (45 per cent), county assembly members (36 per cent) and the Kenya Revenue Authority (34 per cent). The survey polled 2,397 respondents in the 47 counties. The Presidency ranks on the opposite end of the spectrum, with only 27 per cent of the respondents perceiving it as corrupt, as is the Kenya Defence Forces, with a corruption perception of 22 per cent. The Judiciary, however, was perceived to be more corrupt, at 33 per cent."270,Daily Nation (Kenya),4/16/2015,Joho sacks 55 officers over corruption,,KENYA (97%),1144,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,17-Apr-15,,178  words,CORRUPTION (92%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (90%); MISCONDUCT (90%); BRIBERY (88%); POLICE MISCONDUCT (88%); CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES CRIME (87%); ARRESTS (87%); HEROIN (67%); DATE RAPE DRUGS (67%); DRUG TRAFFICKING (67%),"Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has sacked 55 officers from the County Inspectorate Department over misconduct and corruption.

Crafty middle-level and senior officials are devising new schemes to rig tenders and line their pockets with huge sums of money in shady deals, even as President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday reiterated his order that all government procurement must be electronic and warned corrupt officials will be sacked.  Multiple Sunday Nation sources disclosed that an increasingly popular scheme is ""support tendering"" which involves crooked government officials colluding with a closed group of tenderers to ensure various contracts are awarded to the group's members on a rotational basis to crowd out other bidders. Under the plan designed to beat the scrutiny of auditors and anti-corruption investigators, the individual or entity from the closed group marked to win the bid is required to quote a reasonable figure and meet all the technical specifications -- using insider information. The figure includes mark-ups for officials who manipulate the process to ensure only the cartel members are listed. The other bidders in the group will then deliberately quote outrageously high amounts or unreasonably low figures to allow the chosen one to win the tender. The winner will then pay them a ""thank you"" fee that has also been loaded onto the price quoted. The ""support tendering"" cycle rotates to allow other members of the cartel to benefit in turn. Suppliers who follow the regular channels have absolutely no chance of even being pre-qualified by the Supply Chain Management Department, let alone being awarded tenders by the procuring entity. ""It is a deliberate, calculated, sinister and sustained effort by individuals across the public sector with a similar agenda and attitude. It works through inefficiency, deceit, outright lies, bribery, intimidation, and manipulation of accounting and procurement systems,"" said an official of the National Anti-Corruption Campaign Steering Committee, who spoke in confidence. The cartels position themselves to control the paper trail in ministries, from anticipated tenders to minutes of various meetings and the entire procurement process. ""Where and when necessary, paperwork is altered, minutes doctored, letters disappear and reappear when the deal is done,"" said our source. The key players in the schemes are the deputy secretaries who normally double as the administrators for the ministry and chairpersons of the ministerial tender committees, the heads of procurement, the legal officers, and the directors in ministry projects and commissions, committees and other strategic projects in ministries that have their own budgets.  Another important link in the chain are the accountants without whom no payments can be made. Sometimes things get dirty with officials deemed uncooperative ending up ""fixed"" and exposed to auditors and other investigative agencies, according to our source. VANISHING INK In what reads like a script for a Mafia movie, some of the cartels go to the extent of purchasing pens that use disappearing ink which ensures any writing vanishes in between 24 and 48 hours. The disappearing ink pen is used by a government official, who is part of the cartel, to write a cheque with the correct details. This is then presented to a senior official, who is unaware of the scheme, with authority to sign the cheque using ordinary ink. Once the cartel has obtained the genuine signatures from the unsuspecting officials, the payment vouchers and cheques are kept for between 24 to 48 hours after which the details of amounts and payees are changed. When the auditors eventually show up, the approving officer finds himself in hot water as his records of what was signed on differ with what was actually paid. ""Some of the people you see being investigated by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) may be innocent. Often their only mistake is usually that they refused to dance to the tune of the entrenched interests,"" an official said. The cartels are so entrenched that some insiders believe President Kenyatta's order for electronic procurement may not solve all the problems. ""I am convinced that the single largest avenue for loss of public funds is through these cartels that are faceless and ruthless. They design internal systems that for all and sundry look to be protecting public funds, but because they themselves have designed them, they also know their inherent weaknesses and how to exploit the same,"" the NACCSC official said. Another opportunity that officials exploit to loot is the production of goods and services for mass distribution like the printing of government documents. Because of the volumes  involved and the wide distribution, the officials produce less than the numbers budgeted for well aware nobody will take time to count them, so they  pocket the difference. VARY SPECIFICATIONS In the construction industry, the government may budget and release funds for say 10,000 bags of cement. However, in collusion with the implementers of the project, only part of the consignment is delivered. In road construction, resident engineers who oversee the implementation of the projects often collude with contractors to vary specifications and fleece the government of tidy sums of money. Other avenues that are being brazenly exploited by these corrupt officials are trainings and workshops. Last October, two employees of the Export Promotion Council (EPC), Rebecca Mpaayei and Reuben Wanjala, publicly spoke about the brazen looting of government through fictitious projects and ""capacity building"" workshops. ""I am here today because of the misappropriation of funds at EPC that has resulted in poverty among many Kenyans. This is an institution in crisis and the negative trade balance by Kenya is because of these people,"" Ms Mpaayei, then EPC's Women Enterprise Development manager, said. The two accused the EPC of massive misappropriation of funds disguised as training workshops for exporters in Kenya. ""There is no clear monitoring and evaluation to guide the council's activities,"" Mr Wanjala, who at the time was the EPC's ICT and e-Trade Services manager, said. Sunday Nation was also told of a parastatal making a proposal for countrywide training of 40 people in 100 centres. Because the ""capacity building workshops"" were to take place across the country, the institution had to book hotels, pay per diem for staff involved and provide transport. The institution made a proposal and sent it to a United Nations agency that agreed to partially fund it. In reality, only a handful of the workshops took place yet the hotel bills were paid and the attendees paid their fare, accommodation and subsistence allowance. The 'attendees' also signed against their names. ""People create hypothetical projects, and they can even invest in professionals to develop proposals for imaginary projects. Every other public institution has something they are doing and which on the face value looks pretty convincing,"" a civil servant with knowledge of the transactions said. While a lot of national and media focus has been on the ""mega audit queries"", the breathtaking reach of corruption by public servants and the cartels that work with them continues. The local chapter of Transparency International, the anti-corruption watchdog, said while there has been no specific study on the issue, ""a significant amount of money is lost in government"". ""If you combine wastage and this type of sleaze, the amounts of money the public loses to these cartels is huge,"" Mr Samuel Kimeu, the executive director of Transparency International (Kenya), said. FORENSIC AUDIT Edward Ouko, the Auditor-General, remained guarded on the matter. ""In addressing the issues raised, our policy dictates thatŒæwe do not discuss specific client issues. Our discussion is only through audit reports that are public documents. If there are any specific issues that anyone wants the Auditor-General to consider, they could be forwarded to his office to consider carrying out a forensic audit/special audit,"" Mr Ouko said. Kenya Institute of Supplies Management (KISM) chairman Chris Oanda said people who ""manufacture"" documents are not professionals. ""Organisations by their very nature are not bad, but there could be one or two bad eggs which should not be generalised to vilify the procurement professionals who do their work [honestly]. In a situation where people manufacture documents, the criminal justice system should take its course,"" said Mr Oanda. Mr Oanda said a procurement process can only be completed with the involvement honest suppliers who can deliver value. ""But sometimes things do not go right because of misdirection of the procurement process and the many players involved,"" he said. He said that to improve professionalism, a legal framework should be put in place to eliminate ambiguity and place the procurement professionals at the centre of the process. He alluded to a proposed procurement law that will replace the existing Public Procurement and Disposal Act."274,Sudan News Agency (SUNA),4/5/2014,"California's senator Yee indicted on gun, corruption charges",,UNITED STATES (94%),391,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,"CALIFORNIA, USA (94%); PACIFIC OCEAN (58%)",5-Apr-14,"SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA (93%); SACRAMENTO, CA, USA (92%); SAN DIEGO, CA, USA (79%)",711  words,INDICTMENTS (93%); CORRUPTION (92%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (91%); POLITICAL PARTIES (90%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (90%); FIREARMS (90%); GRAND JURY (89%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (89%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (89%); CONSPIRACY (89%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (89%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (89%); FUNDRAISING (88%); ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE (78%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (78%); ILLEGAL WEAPONS (78%); GUN CONTROL (78%); FELONIES (78%); LAWYERS (77%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (76%); POLITICAL CANDIDATES (75%); ARRESTS (72%); SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES (71%); MAYORS (69%); EMPLOYEE LEAVE (66%),"SACRAMENTO, California Fri Apr 4, 2014(Reuters) - A prominent Democratic California state senator and gun-control advocate was indicted by a San Francisco grand jury on charges of corruption and conspiracy to traffic in firearms, according to court documents released on Friday. The indictment adds to the troubles facing state Senator Leland Yee, who was arrested last week and criminally charged along with two dozen others in the same case. He has since been suspended with pay. Yee, 65, is the third California state senator to face criminal charges this year in separate cases that have cost Democrats a cherished two-thirds legislative majority in an election year and prompted them to cancel a major fundraiser planned for this weekend. Senate Democratic leader Darrell Steinberg, who has said that the charges against Yee ""sickened"" him, on Friday renewed calls for the senator to resign. ""Senator Steinberg renews his demand that Senator Yee resign, and resign now,"" spokesman Rhys Williams said in an email to Reuters. The party, which dominates both houses of the legislature and holds all statewide offices, effectively lost its two-thirds majority in the senate last month. Senators Ron Calderon and Roderick Wright were placed on paid leave of absence after Calderon was indicted on corruption charges and Wright was convicted of lying about living in the district he sought to represent. Both were later suspended with pay along with Yee. ""The people of California deserve elected officials who embody the highest levels of integrity,"" said Republican senate leader Bob Huff, who pushed for suspending the three senators. ""It is very troublesome that we have three separate Senators in one year convicted or charged with various felonies."" In canceling a glittering fundraiser that was slated to begin on Friday at the picturesque Torrey Pines Golf Course overlooking the Pacific Ocean near San Diego, Democrats acknowledged ""extraordinary breaches of the public trust"" in the three cases. ""These are unprecedented times and they demand that we take a step back and take stock of how we all do the people's business and balance it against the demands of running for office,"" Steinberg and lawmaker Kevin de Leon said in a joint statement on Tuesday. In a 31-page indictment that sharpens but does not materially change the allegations against Yee, he is charged with six counts of corruption and one count of conspiracy to traffic in firearms. Last week, his lawyer said he planned to plead not guilty, but yesterday Yee hired a new attorney, who did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Among the allegations contained in the indictment is that the one-time San Francisco mayoral candidate accepted cash from an undercover FBI agent seeking to purchase illegal weapons. The indictment says Yee and his campaign consultant, Keith Jackson, sought to enrich themselves and pay off debt from Yee's failed mayoral campaign by accepting bribes, both in cash and by check, from undercover FBI agents. In one instance, Yee wrote a letter on behalf of a technology company that an undercover FBI agent claimed to represent, and in another he helped an undercover FBI agent who said he was working to legalize marijuana in the state, the indictment says. In the indictment, the two men are also accused of offering to help another undercover FBI agent to obtain illegal guns. Yee was arrested along with more than two dozen others last week in a broad sweep of suspected organized crime and corruption activity in San Francisco. Among those charged in the indictment is Raymond ""Shrimp Boy"" Chow, a Chinatown figure who is accused of money laundering and conspiracy. An indictment is likely to make it more difficult for Yee's attorney to argue that the charges should be dismissed, because the process for fighting an indictment is different than the process for fighting a simple criminal charge. Yee is scheduled to appear in San Francisco court next week to be arraigned on the charges, according to court documents. Each of the charges against him carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, according to a press release issued Friday by the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California, whose office will be prosecuting the case. hu"275,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),1/10/2012,"Don't Punish Corruption, Prevent It [opinion]",,ZAMBIA (93%),,Newspaper,Murray Sanderson,ENGLISH,,10-Jan-12,,863 words,CORRUPTION (89%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (89%); CIVIL SERVICES (78%); PREVENTION & WELLNESS (75%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (74%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (71%); PASSPORTS & VISAS (65%); LICENSES & PERMITS (65%) Zambia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"TODAY everyone is talking about punishing the massive corruption which took place under the MMD government. Fine, let's do that. Corruption does great harm to the country, and all honest Zambians want to see it punished. We all cheer when a big fish is caught and put behind bars. We want the Attorney General's Office strengthened and offenders prosecuted, and we want to bring back the law that treated as evidence of corruption the failure by government officials to account for unexplained wealth. But successful prosecution, when achieved, is less than half the battle. Prevention is far better than punishment. It is less exciting, but more effective, just as preventing disease is better than curing it. And with corruption, which is a social disease, prevention is also better than treatment. How can we prevent corruption? By removing, or greatly reducing the opportunities for it. It is, of course, not possible to remove ALL such opportunities. But there is great scope for removing, or at least reducing, most of them. I refer to the countless instances where civil servants in government offices, and in governmental institutions like NAPSA and the ZRA, are responsible for providing services to members of the general public. What kind of services? Almost anything you can think of: issuing national registration cards or passports, issuing any kind of license or permit, paying out any benefit to which a person is entitled, admitting students to institutions of learning, etc., etc. For there are countless requirements which ordinary people need to obtain from 'the powers that be' in order to make progress. The official approached for the document may not have the power to refuse to issue it, but he or she can usually find a way to delay issuing it, and delay can cause the applicant great inconvenience, as well as serious loss or expense. That gives the official concerned an opportunity to extract 'speed money'. If the official approached lacks the power to issue the document applied for, he can delay in recommending its issue to a senior who has the necessary authority. The point here is that civil servants at various levels can so manipulate a situation as to frustrate an applicant in order to extract money for performing an official duty in a timely manner. They may well not make any demand for payment. It is enough to delay and delay, until the applicant becomes so desperate that he or she resorts to offering payment for a service to which they are legally entitled. An alternative route for people who do not know how to apply, or who fear to get involved in corruption, is to pay a hefty sum to an 'agent' or a 'facilitator' to act on their behalf. The fact is that delays create desperation, which often leads to corruption. Indeed delays can virtually compel honest people to be corrupt in order to obtain a benefit to which they are legally entitled. So how can this kind of corruption be prevented? Many countries succeed in preventing it by getting public institutions to publish customer service charters or citizens' charters. Each charter commits the issuing institution to perform within a stipulated period each of the specific services which it offers. The charter is put on display at the institution's offices for members of the public to read. Then, if stated performance times are not met, applicants have the knowledge and the justification to appeal to senior staff. Charters of this kind are used in many countries. In Ghana every government institution has one, and they are very effective. There is even a ministry for government reform! In our own country the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) issued its Taxpayer Charter in February 2008. And in June that year the Ministry of Labour and the Immigration Department both published charters. Since then there has been talk of other ministries and government institutions issuing charters, but these have yet to be published. It is, of course, one thing to issue a charter, and another to make it effective. That is far more difficult. But it can be done, if there is determination, such as has been shown by the ZRA. The Authority invited the Zambia Institute for Public Policy Analysis (ZIPPA) to monitor the performance of the Taxpayer Charter, and to comment in the press on the ZRA's quarterly publication of results. Early last year the ZRA asked ZIPPA to carry out a detailed study of its Taxpayer Charter, and the Authority is now undertaking improvements recommended in the consultant's report. Apart from the three charters introduced in 2008, no other ministry or governmental institution has yet introduced a charter. But several are said to be planning to do so. Charter introduction is one good initiative started during the last government, although it was not persevered with.

Rebecca Kadaga, Speaker of Parliament threatened to put up a list of corrupt legislators. The idea sounds good but puts the Speaker in a metaphoric position of ""making a high political babel. "" It falls short of realising achievable significant impact in the fight against corruption in Uganda. No sickness can be cured by reading out a list of its symptoms without an effective remedy. If Kadaga was genuinely championing anti corruption crusade in Parliament, then she should dig deep but stay outside the hole. Our Speaker should strive to ensure that stringent anti corruption laws are enacted. Such laws will enable courts of law to even order the sale of properties acquired by the Government officials in a corrupt manner to recover embezzled funds. Kadaga needs to know that bad laws are the worst sort of tyranny against the voiceless Ugandan majority in the face of corruption. Weak anti corruption laws have made many Ugandans devices in a wheel for politicians to ride on to their corruption bonanza. Whereas is a major obstacle in the process of our country's economic development and modernisation, Ugandans affected by negative impact of corruption are questioning Kadaga's political intentions of hastening with the list of a strong legal framework against the vice. At best Kadaga is making corruption more unmanageable by blowing hot and cold in her position as Speaker of Parliament. It would seem the 9th Parliament is already stung by poisonous corruption flies! The public is more interested in seeing sophisticated anti corruption laws in place than Kadaga's proposed list of corrupt legislators. The ghost of corruption that has for years dined in various government departments is also residing in Parliament but hidden under the Parliamentary carpet. I am afraid if the Parliamentary carpet is turned upside-down, the ghost of corruption may not spare any member in the House. Remember the 9th Parliament led by Hon. Kadaga herself has made the House a popularist tool against corruption but plays seek and hide game when it comes to enacting the required laws to stamp out the cancer. Still it is the same Parliament that threw journalists out of the House before legislators could bribe their own consciences to give themselves hefty salary and allowances, hence turning themselves into ""slave drivers"" who have forced Ugandans to carry the heavy burden in the mug of poverty. If this is not an act of political corruption and impairing integrity, then what is it? It is true that some corrupt legislators will always turn a blind eye to the suffering that corruption inflicts on others. For instance, after doing itself the best service, Kadaga's 9th Parliament became blind when it came to teachers salary increment. The reason is simple, heavily satisfied horses will not understand that there are hungry folk outside their own domain! So, how will Kadaga's list reconcile this kind of Parliamentary conspiracy? The Speaker needs to understand a philosophical saying that, ""If you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you."" The longer Kadaga takes to enact tougher anti corruption laws, the more culpable she will become before the public eye. Since the Speaker of Parliament has power on her side, let her save poor Ugandans who cannot find drugs in the Government hospitals due to corruption and give us better anti corruption laws. Remember these words: ""Then I looked again at all the injustice that goes on in this world. The oppressed were weeping, and no one would help them. No one would help them, because their oppressors had power on their side,"" Ecclesiastes 4:1. Finally, let our leaders mean business and stop sowing the wind in a society bleeding with serious effects of corruption, else they should expect to reap a storm. We should stop politics of ""old pretenders"" and show real action. Uganda deserves a list of excellent anti corruption laws not a list of corrupt legislators.

New Vision also learnt that the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament, Nandala Mafabi, is expected to face grilling for allegedly failing to act on complaints against some suspected corrupt party officials.

Of these, 836 were corruption cases accounting for the highest number of complaints. The officials were arrested for offences that included abuse of office, soliciting and receiving gratification, causing financial loss, theft, uttering false documents, embezzlement, false accounting. Other offences included bribery, conspiracy to defraud, obtaining goods by false pretense and disobedience of IGG's summons. Among the charged officials were cabinet foreign affairs minister Sam Kuteesa, Government Chief Whip John Nasasira and the Labour State minister Mwesigwa Rukutana. The three ministers were charged with abuse of office charges relating to the mismanagement of the funds meant for Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 2007. However, the Constitutional Court recently stopped the IGG from prosecuting the three ministers because the inspectorate is not fully constituted.

Bwambale on April 3, pleaded guilty to charges of embezzlement and uttering false accountability to chief accountant of Parliament and was accordingly convicted by the Anti-Corruption Court. The Inspectorate of Government has now asked the Speaker to take action against Bwambale. In a letter dated May 18, the deputy IGG, Raphael Baku quoted section 80(2)(f) of the Constitution which stipulates that a person is not qualified for election as an MP if that person has, within seven years immediately preceding the election, been convicted by a competent court of a crime involving dishonesty or moral turpitude ""This, therefore, is to forward the matter to you for your appropriate action,"" Baku said in a letter. However, when contacted over the matter, Bwambale said he had not received the letter asking him to vacate his seat. He said the IGG was acting unfairly and wants him to be punished twice for the same offence. ""Court did not rule that I should vacate my seat. I was asked to pay a fine which I did. I cannot be punished twice for the same offence. Baku is acting unfairly,"" Bwambale said. By Tuesday, Hellen Kaweesa, the spokesperson of Parliament, said she had not received the letter asking Bwambale to vacate his seat. Justice Catherine Bamugemereire sentenced Bwambale to a fine of sh1m for uttering false documents, a fine of sh2m for embezzlement and ordered him to refund sh10m paid to him as Constituency Development fund with interest to be determined by court. Bihande admitted that he stole the Constituency Development funds that he received between 2009 and 2010 and failed to account for. MPs used to receive sh20m every financial year as development funds for their constituencies and they were to account for it. The scheme was later stopped.

Under the proposed arrangement, a whistleblower will be entitled to a 10% of all the money recovered by the Authority. The KCCA executive director, Jennifer Musisi announced the move. The move is part of efforts to fight corruption and improve efficiency in revenue collection at the Authority. Last year, a special audit of the Authority by the Auditor General discovered over sh52b lying idle on over 152 bank accounts managed by the defunct Kampala City Council (KCC). The sources of the money are still unknown. The 10% whistleblower reward offered by KCCA will be one of the biggest awards offered by an institution, and twice the pay offered under the Whistle-blowers Protection Act, 2010. The Act states that a whistle-blower shall be given 5% of the money recovered as a reward for the disclosure and the money is meant to be paid within six months after it is recovered. It also provides for a five-year jail term for anyone who reveals the identity of a whistle-blower. In case of danger, the state will provide security for the whistle-blower and his family, it adds. The Act also guarantees the whistle-blower's job and protects them from victimization. However, if a whistle-blower is found to be lying, they will serve five years in prison as well.

In his acceptance speech, Odoki vowed to use his newly acquired position to instill values of tolerance, unity and respect for diversity of views in the Ugandan population, explaining that they are the cornerstones of building peace. ""Peace is an important value for a country that has seen her fair share of conflicts; it is the foundation for unity and justice. Now that there is peace, there is opportunity to grow,"" Odoki said. ABETO is a non-governmental organization (NGO) established in 1996 aiming to promote tolerance in governance in Africa. It has awarded several African leaders for promoting peace across the continent. Recipients of ABETO peace awards include former South African president Nelson Mandela, South Sudanese leader, Salva Kiir and Uganda's Yoweri Museveni."289,New Vision (Kampala),7/27/2012,Try Genetic Engineering to Sort Out Corruption [opinion],,CHINA (96%); UGANDA (95%),,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,NORTH CENTRAL CHINA (72%),27-Jul-12,"BEIJING, CHINA (57%)",548 words,BIOTECHNOLOGY & GENETIC SCIENCE (94%); GENETIC ENGINEERING (91%); CORRUPTION (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); BIOLOGY (90%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (90%); GENES & CHROMOSOMES (88%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (78%); POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (78%); BIOCHEMISTRY (74%); DNA (74%); CHANGE MANAGEMENT (73%); PSYCHOLOGY (67%) Uganda; Corruption; Science and Biotechnology,"The brutality and pathological incompetence of the past regimes induced a kind of post-traumatic stress disorder from which Uganda seems not to have recovered. Ugandans do things that are unbelievably ridiculous; they are restless and convulsive as if the liberation wars of the yesteryears introduced a virus into the organism Uganda. Did you know that the substandard goods from China are custom-made at the behest of Ugandan traders and businessmen? Morally, Uganda appears to be stricken, even dying or convalescing from a life-threatening greed and corruption illness which some suspect of retarding development. A senior UN Official in whose company a senior civil servant and I traveled to China recently suggested that an experiment in genetic engineering may be necessary to create a corruption-free development oriented society. His comment was prompted by what we saw in Beijing: efficiency, effectiveness, development and organisation perfected to a fi ne art and a science both rolled into one. A consensus of molecular biology scientists in the 1970s opined that genetic code discoveries and the mechanism of genetic transcription and translation constituted the greatest intellectual achievement of modern science, which could be utilised for understanding DNA and improving the human species. An interdisciplinary approach: genetic method, genetic engineering triangulated with social psychology to focus on studying individual attitudes, their formation and change. Genetics has medical applications and is used in animal and plant breeding. Is it not possible that corruption is a result of flawed genetic instruction? Neuropathology experiments could focus on isolating the genes that is responsible for corruption so that it can be inactivated. While we were in China, a manned submarine dived to the deepest level ever under the sea in the Mariana Trench and within hours the first Chinese woman Astronaut was also sent into space. China has been quietly developing without gloating about it. Effectiveness is achieved when a country attains its desired outcomes. Efficiency can be defined in economic terms as the least necessary expenditure of resources to attain desired outcomes. It is a measure of how well resources are utilised to produce output. To attain effectiveness and efficiency to pave the way for the kind of development for which South Korea and Vietnam are renowned, there is an urgent need to change attitudes and perception of political and economic rationality. Understanding when and how to implement change is a vital part of management science but technology, a keyword in President Museveni's speeches, is the conversion process used to transform inputs into outputs. Because of the rapid rate of technological innovation, change is important to countries with the correct vision for development. China has changed the way many things are done, how it relates to other countriesand react to situations of adversity. Change creates problems of legitimacy and viability whereby the former is established when a country finds that output fills a need but society's needs and judgments change. The realistic way forward for Africa is to copy the China model.

Mbabazi was speaking at the 19th Annual General Meeting of the Uganda National Association of Building and Civil Engineering Contractors at Imperial Royale Hotel in Kampala on Thursday. He observed that most local contractors are unable to compete favourably in the regional market because they do not invest in the construction industry. ""It is common that when some contractors succeed, they do not invest in the construction industry.

To begin with, I think the only realistic yardstick to gauge laws is not whether they are few or many, but, on whether they are good or bad; or effective in administering justice. The existing laws should be effective enough to bring an impact to the majority of those seeking justice from them. For example, the inadequacies in the existing Anti- Corruption Act 2009 and other related laws, have often failed the state to recover in real terms the proceeds lost to corruption prompting the introduction of The Anti- Corruption Amendment Bill 2012. This will enhance the effectiveness of the existing anti corruption laws by; introducing Confiscation of gains derived from stealing public resources as a sentence fixed by law and establishing a clear procedure for confiscating wealth derived from corruption from the culprit and other beneficiaries like relatives and bonafide partners. At the end of the day, the Bill will not only make corruption a very risky business among those entrusted with public resources, but will also restore hope and faith in law among Ugandans. The Whistle Blower's Act 2010 once faced the same kind of criticism, however, today, its existence has seen the Inspectorate of Government boast of an overwhelming number of reported complaints. For instance, it is said that as at May 2010, the Inspectorate had initiated 1,254 complaints out of which 836 were corruption cases; the highest reported in history.64 public officers are reported to have been arrested to that effect. We should thus judge laws on effectiveness and not on quantity. In addition, just like the Whistle blower's Act 2010, the Anti- Corruption Amendment Bill 2012 will also enhance public or community participation in reporting corruption cases something that is anticipated to yield even more results and popularise the fight against graft. The Bill will also supplement the Leadership Code Act 2002 because it provides for the disclosure of information pertaining to declared wealth of those suspected to have gained from corruption. That way, it is expected to enhance effectiveness of the Act to yield more results in curbing the vice. It should be noted that Members of Parliament are mandated by the public with a key role of making laws. Cognizant of the fact that corruption is still high and getting more sophisticated by the day, I think it would be unfair to the tax payers for a house consisting as many as 375 legislators to fail to have on record any initiative or even amendment of the existing laws to address the problem that is cited as the major reason as to why the tax payer can not benefit efficiently from public service delivery. There are so many ways to kill a rat, and I cannot dispute the fact that there are other measures taken to fight corruption by the August house, I think all these measures actually indicate that there is political will among the members of the Ninth House towards fighting corruption. Therefore, we should not undermine any effort geared towards this cause mindful of the fact that we are different players with different capacities. A perfect and adequate legal framework, clearly defining the procedure of fighting the vice, setting befitting sentences and generally making corruption a very risky business to not only the culprit but also close relatives and bonafide partners (who may have benefitted from it) is a good initiative. As for political will, the onus is now on the public; to vote for those leaders who have the will to fight corruption, demand for proper accountability and demand for good governance."292,New Vision (Kampala),8/21/2012,Commonwealth Corruption Case Resumes,,UGANDA (79%),,Newspaper,Anne Mugisa,ENGLISH,,22-Aug-12,,213 words,TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (90%); APPOINTMENTS (88%); CORRUPTION (78%); PRIME MINISTERS (77%); LAWYERS (75%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (70%); HOTELS & MOTELS (68%); PARKING SPACES & FACILITIES (54%) Uganda; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Governance; Corruption,"The case against three ministers charged with causing loss of sh14b in activities during the preparation for the 2007 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (Chogm) resumes today.

Preaching on Sunday at Saint Francis chapel in Makerere University, Orombi observed that all efforts made by the government and other development partners to develop Uganda were thwarted by corruption saying the vice is gradually eating away all the economic resources and benefits of the country. He castigated the local culture for promoting a practice of corruption in the country adding that the rural folk praise those who prosper by embezzling public resources. ""Corruption in Uganda is so rife and does not only begin when one is employed as it's mostly assumed; it begins earlier than that because of our backgrounds. Some of us are born corrupt and live with it,"" Orombi said. ""The problem of most young people today is that they want to get rich within a year. If some of the successful people you see today had that kind of attitude and mentality, they wouldn't be where they are,"" he added. During the same service, Makerere University Chancellor Prof. Mondo Kagonyera said, ""Every day, we read in media that someone has either stolen large amounts of public resources or has been convicted for doing so,"" Quoting John 15: 17, Orombi urged Ugandans to unconditionally love each other and not indulge corruption as it hurts their fellow brothers and sisters. The duo was flanked by Makerere University vice Chancellor Prof. John Dumba Sentamu. Orombi's comments come at a time when findings of corruption index conducted Transparency International shows that Uganda is the most corrupt country in the East African region with the country garnering a bribery level of 40.7. A survey conducted by John Paul II Justice and Peace Centre also reveals that 95% of Ugandans feel corruption has steadily grown in the country since independence with the justice sector castigated as the most corrupt. The congregation rewarded Orombi with an assortment of gifts such as a Frisian heifer, an electric chair, generator, among others in appreciation of his eight-year service to the Church of Uganda.

The image of Africa as a continent beset by corruption has dominated the popular imagination for decades, reinforced by its consistently dismal performance in anti-corruption league tables. From routine demands for bribes by policemen to grand scale looting of state funds by its rulers, corruption has been blamed for stunting Africa's growth, keeping millions in poverty and scaring off investors. But now may be the time for international investors especially to reconsider their perceptions. In ""Global Corruption: Money, Power and Ethics in the Modern World,"" Laurence Cockcroft argues that the main drivers of corruption, including the informal economy, political funding, the role of multinationals and organised crime, are common to many countries and graft is not intrinsic to Africa. ""The pattern of corruption which occurs in Africa is remarkably similar to that elsewhere,"" Cockcroft told Reuters. ""This is an international phenomenon and it's certainly not a uniquely African issue."" Cockcroft does not deny that corruption is a huge problem in Africa. While average GDP growth of around 5 percent over the last decade has led to higher urban living standards, life for poor, rural dwellers in the bulk of sub-Saharan Africa has not improved because governments cannot deliver basic services, he said. The book has no shortage of examples of African kleptocracy, from Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire -- now Democratic Republic of the Congo -- to Nigeria, where oil wealth has brought prosperity to only a few. Still, Cockcroft finds equally egregious examples in other parts of the world, and of the ""mega corruption scandals"" over the last 25 years, not one has been in Africa. He cites former Indonesian president Suharto, whose family amassed a fortune of at least $15 billion; the presidency of Alberto Fujimori in Peru in the 1990s, where corruption is believed to have halved the revenue due to the government; and India, where a 2008 telecoms licensing scandal cost the government an estimated $30 billion in lost revenue. More recently, he points to Russia, where protests since December against President Vladimir Putin's 12-year rule have focused on corruption, and the downfall of former politician Bo Xilai in China after his wife murdered a British businessman. ""We can safely say that these dramas in relation to corruption which are happening outside Africa are at least the equal and in many cases on a grander scale than what happens in Africa itself,"" Cockcroft said. He reckons Africa has been unfairly singled out when it comes to corruption in part because of the legacy view of the late colonial period. ""People have taken a very gloomy view of what's happened in Africa since independence, sometimes with justification and sometimes not,"" he said. ""Some of that is built into this assumption that if you talk about corruption you're talking about Africa."" It is true that many African countries languish in the lower half of most anti-corruption indices, although in Transparency's latest Corruption Perceptions Index, the bottom 10 has only two African states -- Somalia and Sudan. The annual index ranks countries from 0, highly corrupt, to 10, -- very clean). Most African nations score below 4. The most urgent priority for African governments, Cockcroft argues, is to reduce the size of the shadow economy, estimated to be as much as 60 percent of GDP in Tanzania. He describes it as ""a huge reservoir for bribes"" and payments that are completely untraceable. ""It doesn't matter what the legislation is,"" he said. ""As long as you have a huge informal sector, people can still buy off officials in city hall."" There are no clear cut success stories in the fight against corruption in Africa, he notes, as former opposition leaders who come to power on anti-corruption tickets are often derailed by the desire to remain in power. But he adds that one leader who could buck the trend is Zambia's president Michael Sata, whose government has reversed a number of privatisation deals initiated under the previous regime. Cockcroft says Zambia and Ghana, which also seems serious about tackling graft, will be the countries to watch."298,New Vision (Kampala),11/11/2012,Nine Corruption Scandals to Look Back At,,UGANDA (95%),,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,12-Nov-12,,1112 words,SCANDALS (91%); CORRUPTION (91%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (90%); AIDS & HIV (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (89%); TUBERCULOSIS (86%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (77%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (77%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (77%); PRIME MINISTERS (77%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (77%); GRANTS & GIFTS (76%); BUILDING RENOVATION (73%); CONSTRUCTION (73%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (71%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (69%); MALARIA (69%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (69%); PRISONS (68%); SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE (68%); ROAD & BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION (68%); ACQUITTAL (66%); WAGES & SALARIES (65%); PROJECT MANAGEMENT (63%); HIGHWAYS & STREETS (53%) Uganda; Corruption; Governance; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Investment; Tuberculosis; HIV-Aids and STDs; Aid and Assistance,"The cost of corruption is huge. We look back at nine graft scandals that have tossed Uganda here and there in the recent past. This came to public attention last year (2011). Several ministers, including former Vice-President, Gilbert Bukenya, Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi and former state minister for works and transport, John Byabagambi, were implicated in the mismanagement of billions of public funds meant for the 2007 CHOGM summit. Others implicated were ministers John Nasasira, Mwesigwa Rukutana and Isaac Musumba. Although Parliament allocated sh270 billion to the summit, the Auditor General discovered that more than sh370 billion was spent. The figures went up to sh500b after parliamentary accounts committee grilled those who spent the funds. The probe, commissioned by President Yoweri Museveni, found out that money was lost in irregular procurement of the CHOGM cars, road construction and repairs, and the renovation of Entebbe Airport, among other ventures. Several permanent secretaries interrogated claimed they had acted on orders from former Vice-President Gilbert Bukenya, who was the chairman of the Cabinet sub-committee on CHOGM. Prof. Bukenya was accused of influence-peddling in the sh19 billion CHOGM car deal, but later court acquitted him. At the time of investigations, $10 million (sh25 billion) was missing, although some sources put the figure at $37 (sh95.8 billion). The money was meant for malaria and tuberculosis drugs programmes. The scandal sucked in former health minister Jim Muhwezi and his then deputies Mike Mukula and Alex Kamugisha. Some of the known culprits include the director of economic affairs in the President's Office, Teddy Cheeye and former production manager of Uganda Television, Fred Kavuma, who are currently on remand in Luzira Prison over the scam. Although many of people have since been absolved of wrongdoing by court, Mike Mukula was told recently that he has a case to answer. The scandal centered on a new unit within the Health Ministry, known as the Project Management Unit (PMU), through which the money was siphoned to about 400 private organisations, many of which existed only on paper. Investigations revealed that PMU paid grossly infl ated salaries to its 15 professionals and 20 support staff, who often doubled their take home pay with generous and largely undocumented expense allowances. Since its creation in 2002, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has committed $5.1b in grants to more than 130 countries to fight the three diseases. NSSF-Temangalo saga came to light in July 2008, when reports emerged that Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi, then security minister and Amos Nzeyi had been paid sh11b by the Fund for 414 acres of land, with each acre going for sh24m. It was reported that the price was higher than that on the market, resulting into the Fund losing billions of shillings. Knight Frank put the price of an acre in the area at sh18m, East African Consulting Surveyors at sh16m and Associated Consulting Surveyors at sh14m. NSSF decided to go for what it called an open market price of sh24m. The Parliamentary probe found that Mbabazi used his clout as security minister to force NSSF to purchase his land. In its majority report, the parliamentary committee investigating the matter concluded that indeed Mbabazi and Ezra Suruma had violated sections of the Leadership Code. In February, 2010, the Government entered a deal with Mí€Œ_hlbauer, a German firm, to supply national IDs. Muhlbauer High Tech was allegedly contracted without open bidding as required by law. The company was to supply and install equipment for production of the identity cards. The IDs were supposed to be used to identify eligible voters during the 2011 elections. But by February last year, the company had reportedly produced only 400 cards. Parliament learnt that the Government borrowed over sh150 billion to finance the project, which has never kicked off. According to the PAC, contracting the firm resulted in a financial loss of sh19b. The ministers implicated include former general duties minister, Kiddu Makubuya, former internal affairs minister, Kirunda Kivejinja and the local government Permanent Secretary, Steven Kagoda. Amman Industrial Tool and Equipment Ltd, a locally-registered company, was contracted by the Ministry of Local Government to supply 70,000 bicycles meant for LCs, but no single bicycle was delivered. The company was reportedly paid $1.7 million (about sh4 billion). Sh60b went missing from Microfinance Support Centre in a record three months. Former Vice-President Dr. Specioza Wandira Kazibwe, who was the board chairperson, was subsequently suspended over allegations of abuse of office and mismanagement in the office she assumed in 2008. Others board members who were suspended are MP Tim Lwanga, Mutebi Kityo, Charles Ogol from the finance ministry and Twino Musinguzi. President Yoweri Museveni started the institution in 2003, to ensure Ugandans accessed funds for poverty reduction in their households. Sh169 billion was 'erroneously' issued to city tycoon Hassan Basajjabalaba as compensation for the loss of business for the city markets last year. Two ministers, Syda Bbumba of finance and attorney general Khiddu Makubuya, were axed alongside three members of staff at State House on the matter. However, the Government exonerated the Bank of Uganda governor, Tumusiime Mutebile, of any wrongdoing in the compensation. Sh169b meant to clear outstanding pension claims of 1,018 former East African Community workers went missing between February and October last year. The money is said to have been siphoned through Cairo International Bank, with connivance from top employees of the ministries of public service and finance. Peter Sajjabi, the East African Community Beneficiaries Association general secretary, admitted to the Police that he had recommended the 1,018 names, which he said were passed on to him by the Ministry of Public Service, to Cairo International Bank for account opening. The principal accountant in the Prime Minister's Office, Geoffrey Kazinda, was recently remanded to Luzira Prison in connection with the disappearance of sh5 billion. The money, meant for the Peace Recovery and Development Plan for Northern Uganda, was reportedly transferred to the Crisis Management and Recovery account, from where it was siphoned. Kazinda has been charged before the Anti-Corruption Court with abuse of office, causing financial loss, embezzlement, false accounting and forgery.

According to the 2005 World Bank survey, Uganda loses an estimated sh510b a year through corruption, while the Global Integrity Report of 2006 put the figure at about sh1 trillion, which was about half of the annual budget then. Many don't see how we can win the fight against an organised corrupt system. But John Masaba asks experts what the country should do. We should make corruption a high-risk venture so that those who steal are paid back with ridicule, instead of glory. Today, people who boast of high integrity and honesty are perceived as non-starters. Uganda should pick a leaf from Singapore, which has taken a high-handed approach to corruption and reaped tremendous benefits from its action. Religious leaders should work harder, reach out to the people and tell them that corruption is robbery. We should use the prophet's teaching: ""Love thy neighbour as you love thyself"". If you steal public money, you are not only making government delivery of services difficult, but also denying others what is due to them. Corruption is rampant everywhere and there is nothing we can do about it. If it has not stopped elsewhere, why do you think Uganda can stop it? Corruption started in the Bible, with Jacob fraudulently getting Esau's blessing. And in Uganda, it is our custom. Why else would crowds gather at Entebbe to welcome a thief convicted for possessing counterfeit dollars in the US? We have good anti-corruption laws and policies, but we are not getting anywhere with them. Our leaders are not implementing the laws we have. And what are the people doing? They should rise up and take action on the corrupt officials at the districts and municipalities. This will put pressure on those in higher offices. If a sustained fight against corruption builds momentum at the lower level, we shall see change at the top. The public should know that fighting corruption is not the responsibility of the Government alone, but for us all. Some parents are not afraid to lie in the presence of children. Pupils campaigning for elections in schools give sweets for votes, nurturing corruption in them. When they grow, the sweets turn into money and later, big money and other favours. Before you know it, a corrupt leader has been raised. There is increased exposure and awareness about corruption in the country. When the society is more aware, it may seem like corruption is increasing. The Inspectorate of Government will continue tracking public officials found to be engaging in corrupt acts. We shall use the existing legal framework, such as the IGG Act, the Anti-corruption Act and the Leadership Code. There is currently no new strategy, other than emphasising focus and direction in some of the already existing areas. With the development of the Annual Report on Tracking Corruption Trends, using the Data Tracking Mechanism, I will study the trends of corruption in the country. Over the years, I will be able to indicate which sectors of government are more corrupt. The current challenge, however, is that the available statistics still cannot give the trend of corruption holistically. The citizens should be sensitised not to accept corruption as a norm. We should improve the living conditions of people providing critical services like the Police, health workers and magistrates. A number of studies have recommended salary reviews, but not much has been done. Also, the civil society should come up with tangible solutions and interventions, rather than rhetorical condemnation. Religious and political leaders should address the moral decadence and consumptive behaviour in society today. The answer lies in changing top leadership. Even if you bring good people to work under this system, they will change nothing. Asking NRM to stop corruption is like asking rhinos to give you ghee. Corruption is the engine that drives this Government because the top leadership is greedy and selfish. The current political system has to change because it breeds corruption. The country needs a new breed of leaders. Even if the Government creates more departments to fight graft, I do not think anything will change. There is no political will in Uganda to fight corruption. In countries like Malaysia and China, the guilty are killed by firing squad. In the neighbouring Rwanda, their president has a no-nonsense stance. But here, we protect thieves, instead of prosecuting them. In PAC, we are always investigating and making recommendations against corrupt officials, but no action is taken. We should confiscate what the culprit has stolen and this money should be brought back to the Government coffers. We should return term limits. When a regime is in power for not more than 10 years, it is difficult for corruption to thrive. In addition, the executive should implement the available anti-corruption laws to make life difficult for the corrupt. The opposition should be tougher, to make the Government more accountable. I know some public servants are committed to fighting corruption, but the gap between the highest and lowest paid public servants is high. This gap must also be reduced to create equity. We need to check on the integrity of our service providers in our offices and get them to be more patriotic. We should also see to it that they are satisfied in their jobs. We should begin by enhancing salaries of holders of public offices, especially those who work under tempting situations. We also need to strengthen the anti-corruption laws, they are not prohibitive enough. Corruption in Uganda is a leadership problem. It requires political solutions. The President should not fear to disappoint some of his friends by throwing them out when they are embellished with corruption. Only in Uganda do ministers steal millions of public money and still be eligible for reappointment. This makes the thieves heroes and inspires others to steal even more. Corruption should be made a risky business by making thieves pay heavily to deter others. I also think the media can play a role by blacklisting all corrupt politicians. The communities whose leaders are involved in corruption should also push them out of power. We have not done enough in preaching against corruption in this country. We should check on what we preach and how we do it. Uganda has 80% Christians, how can we be number one in corruption? Preachers in the past succeeded with a message of repentance and many people turned away from their sins. Are we just spreading religion without convincing people to repent? Does everyone know what to do? Isn't it about time they joined the fight?"300,New Vision (Kampala),11/12/2012,"Cabinet Praises Attorney General, Police On Corruption Fight",,UGANDA (90%),,Newspaper,Henry Mukasa,ENGLISH,,13-Nov-12,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (90%)",237 words,CORRUPTION (90%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (90%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (78%); CIVIL SERVICES (77%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (77%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (73%); PRIME MINISTERS (73%); INDUSTRY SECTOR PERFORMANCE (69%); HOTELS & MOTELS (57%) Uganda; Corruption; Governance; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Despite a nationwide outcry that corruption has become cancerous, with its persistence decapitating service delivery, cabinet has in a self-appraisal saluted its efforts to fight the vice.

First, I firmly believe that unless an antidote against increasing corruption if found, efforts towards transformation of this nation will be gravely hurt. Indeed corruption or the simple dereliction of duty creates massive all-round inefficiencies in delivery of public services. Therefore, corruption is a serious issue and should be treated as such. Secondly, across the board, we need to think and act creatively to find practical solutions to end this vice. But why are many actors in Parliament, wider media and civil society transforming corruption into a platform for blackmail, innuendo, and selfish political positioning and limelight/sound bite predatory schemes? Corruption should never be a stimulus for ugly partisan political contestations, but rather an evil we should all roundly reject and fight. The recent allegations against the First Lady, Janet Museveni smacks of the foregoing ill schemes. These schemers are trying to use the so called ""lion strategy"" by attempting to blackmail and isolate leaders they presume to be strong challengers. For example, without attempting to verify facts but run to falsely allege that the First Lady travelled to Israel eight times in one month is silly and lazy. But why would the Auditor General publish falsehoods about the First Lady without inquiring with her office on this matter? Why would the wider media publish the story without deploying their investigative assets to find the truth? Why would someone in the wider public use twitter, facebook, e-google etc to crucify the First Lady for money paid to OPM cashiers' personal accounts? Why are we not crosschecking facts and summoning reason? Is responsibility in free speech-too much to ask? This is simply a skewed attempt to tarnish the name of the First Lady who has staked out her neck in many ways to serve the public good. If we don't stop and reflect, legitimate efforts to fight corruption will be pushed under water by swarms of self-interest. Indeed, the 'holier than though' parliament will restore legitimacy in the fight against corruption by engaging in self-examination. A data visualisation by Advocates Coalition for Development and Environment shows that Parliamentary Commission expenditure is shooting through the roof. From sh82 billion in the 2008/2009 financial year, it hit sh280 billion in the 2010/2011 financial year. A deeper drill into the data shows that many MPs are spending tax payers' money on foreign trips. MPs are entitled to an allowance of sh1.4m ($550) per day spent out of the country on official duty. On the 21st of November 2011, the media reported that sh8.5b was allocated to facilitate at least 300 of the 344 legislators on foreign travel for the financial year 2011/2012. In a space of just four months sh2.2b had already been spent on MPs' foreign travels - an average of Sh550m per month! Yet they are quick to throw tantrums at the First Lady who explained her single trip to Israel at half the cost because she delayed her trip to hitch a lift on the presidential jet, since her husband President Yoweri Museveni was travelling to New York for a United Nations General Assembly. But what are our MPs doing abroad? Have we increased our exports as a result of their trips? Has parliament become more efficient with infusion of lessons from abroad? Is this how they fight for aspirations of their constituents? Allegations that some MPs pick per diem and hang around should be investigated. Official travels should be streamlined to national interest to avert bloating public administration expenditure. An independent media and civil society can do a lot for the fight against corruption. Part of the solution in the fight against this vice is in propagating factual information on expenditure, releases etc to the wider population. Information has the power to stimulate imagination of citizenry to, for instance, ask and monitor what is going on and most importantly, follow their money and hold officialdom to account. Apart from bickering, there are practical experiences of what works when tackling corruption. For example, in 1996, Rivtva Reinikka and Jakob Svensson in a study tracked how much of the capitation grant reached the schools. The figures from the survey teams that went to the schools were then compared with the computer records of the releases. The answer they got was nothing short of stunning. Only 13% of funds ever reached the schools. More than half of the school got nothing at all. Inquiries suggested that a lot of the money most likely ended up in the pockets of district officials and bureaucrats. When these results were released in Uganda- there was uproar - and the finance ministry started publicising the releases in the main national newspapers. By 2001, when Reinikka and Svensson repeated their school survey, they found the schools were getting, an average 80% of the discretionary money they were entitled to. About half of the school head teachers that had received less than their entitlements initiated formal complaints and eventually most of them received their money. There were no reports of reprisals against them or against newspapers that run the story. It seems the district officials had been happy to embezzle the money when no one was watching but stopped when that became more difficult. These Uganda head teachers suggest an exciting possibility: If rural schools head teachers could fight corruption, perhaps it is not necessary to wait for a change of government or profound transformation of institutions for better policies to be implemented. Careful thinking and access to ferment of information driven through the wider media has potential to check and stop corruption. Unfortunately, quite often what you see is mudslinging, partisanship and laziness by actors in the media and public arena. It is a central responsibility of media to do rigorous research, deliberate inquiries and due diligence-necessary for fair reporting. Some journalists and media houses have turned into political activists instead of professional umpires in the business of information. In fighting this corruption monster, let us be fair, balanced, just and factual. Let us not play to the gallery.

They cited corruption scandals like ghost students in UPE, GAVI fund, CHOGM, Temangalo, ghost soldiers, Global Fund, KCCA, Office of the Prime Minister and Police as some of cases Government has not handled to the satisfaction of citizens. They appealed to all NGOs in the country who detest the level of theft of public funds to express their dissatisfaction against Government on corruption by closing their offices every first Monday of the month and join public protests against the vice. The group also indicated they would gather ideas from various citizens from which they would write a special letter to President Museveni to take stern action on corruption. In the action they outlined, they demanded that all officials accused of corruption should be relieved of their duties, face trial and punishment, their property be confiscated to recover what they stole, and an apology from Government for failing to fight corruption. Their planned procession in different parts of the city was however blocked by the Police. ""We cannot allow it to go on because they did not notify us.

The meeting was held at State House Entebbe. The meeting follows a decision by some donor countries cutting aid to Uganda following a financial scandal rocking the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM). A report by the auditors general shows about sh38b meant for peace and recovery programme in northern Uganda was stolen and diverted into private accounts. Below is the President's full statement: Greetings to all of you, Excellencies. You cannot talk, seriously or credibly about the fight against criminality and corruption in Uganda in the last 50 years and the period before without talking about the vanguard role of the NRM in that fight. Until 26 years ago, stealing Government funds was the least of Uganda's problems. The main problems were: extra-judicial killings (that resulted into the death of 800,000 Ugandans between 1966 and 1986); looting of property of the population by the soldiers; raping of women; brutalizing of the population through beatings by the soldiers; uprooting of whole communities by the soldiers, like Idi Amin did with the Indian community, or like the colonial system did with the Banyoro, Baruuli, Banyala and others; the poaching of animals by Government soldiers in the National Parks; the grabbing of private and communal lands by those in power; and, of course, the stealing of Government funds. The NRM, which started as a student Movement in the 1960s, was the vanguard and pioneer of the fight against all this criminality and corruption since, at least, 1965 to-date. We started by defending the land of the peasants between 1966 and 1970 - at least, in some parts of the country. Who were the agents of criminality, corruption and extortion? It was the State - both the Colonial and the post-Colonial State. During the colonial times, for instance, the system of mailo was created where 8,000 square miles was taken away from the indigenous owners and was given to 1,000 collaborator chiefs, each one getting 8 sq. miles. When this grand theft almost caused an uprising in 1924, the Governor, Mitchell, appointed a Commission of Enquiry, which resulted in some reforms of 1928. However, the problem was not fully eliminated. We are still grappling with it. We shall definitely solve it. Apart from the grabbing of land, extra-judicial killings were massively used, especially between 1966 and 1986, as already pointed out. There are 37 mass graves in the Luwero Triangle, preserved to capture this criminality. Your Excellencies could go there and visit some of them. Therefore, the main task of the revolutionaries was to destroy the rump of the colonial State - the colonial Army, headed by the likes of Idi Amin and to build a people's Army. It is this intervention that made Uganda to resurrect and chart a new course. Many people have been praising the conduct of the UPDF in Somalia. That is a consequence of that Revolution - destroying the colonial Army and replacing it with a people's Army as part of reforming the colonial State. Incidentally, this was not unique to Uganda. Throughout the whole of Africa, this was the problem. The terrible civil war in Nigeria, Mobutu in Congo, Siad Barre in Somalia, Bokassa in Central Africa, Eyadema in Togo, the recent problems of Ivory Coast, the genocides in Rwanda and Burundi can all, in one way or another, be traced to the colonial State and its Armies. Some go a bit further to link up with the African feudal systems of the pre-colonial times as exploited by colonialism. Therefore, our revolution was both anti-colonial and anti-feudal. The most dangerous element of the Colonial State was the Colonial Army and its post-colonial mutants - Uganda Army (UA), Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA), etc. This Army was sectarian, illiterate, unpatriotic, etc. Our Revolution, on the other hand, was based on four principles: (i) Patriotism; (ii) Pan-Africanism; (iii) Socio-economic transformation; and (iv) Democracy By destroying the colonial Army and replacing it with the Revolutionary Army, we, immediately, cured the following criminalities: 1. Extra-judicial killings; 2. Raping of women; 3. Looting of people's property; 4. Brutalizing of people and rudeness to them; 5. Poaching of animals from the National Parks; and 6. Grabbing people's land; etc. That is how Uganda resurrected and started the recovery process, which has been witnessed in recent years (the last 26 years). The colonial Army, however, was not the only element in the colonial State. There were other elements: (i) The civil service; (ii) The Police; (iii) The Judiciary; (iv) The Professional services (medical, veterinary, teaching), etc. It was actually a bit easier to reform the Army. What that needed was a correct ideological-philosophical outlook. As already said, our outlook is: patriotism, pan-Africanism, socio-economic transformation (modernization) and democracy. To these, or even as a consequence of patriotism, if you add heroism and courage, given the comparatively Uganda's good educational standards even during the colonial times, it was easy to build a good pro-people Army. All this was also assisted by the solid martial culture of the people of Uganda the decadent feudal system that tended to smoother the qualities of our people notwithstanding. Why? A recruit course takes six months to nine months, an officer - cadet's course takes twelve months and a Non Commissioned Officer's (NCO) course takes four months. This is based on assumption that you have people of the right educational level, age-bracket and health. The ideological aspects can be imparted by the leadership through teaching and by example. This can quickly get you people to lead platoons and with accelerated training, you will get people to lead companies, etc. Anybody with a University degree in general studies or A-level education can be turned into a good soldier, NCO or officer. Specialists for Air-force, engineering and other specialties need science education. Fortunately, these are needed in smaller numbers. However, with Administration (Accounting officers), professional services (doctors, lawyers, veterinary), Judiciary, etc., you need longer periods of preparation. Some of these courses need science education or mathematics, which are subjects that are not as popular as the humanities. Many of them (the people involved), besides, had a careerist attitude, different from us the revolutionaries whose approach was a revolutionary one - working, selflessly, without caring about remuneration, never claiming overtime allowances, staying in grass thatched huts instead of clamouring for good housing (just as we did in the bush), etc. Then, there was also the politics. We could not have massively disbanded the civil service as we did with the Army without alienating the public. At that time, the civil service was not as unpopular as the army. The army's criminality was much clearer to the masses and our destroying it has given us political capital whose account is not yet overdrawn í¢í‰ í‰  26 years after. In any case, we did not have others to replace them at that time. We, therefore, decided to tackle the problem piece-meal, quite early on. In addition to the army, we decided to reform Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) - the former East African Customs Department plus other tax departments. These departments were very corrupt. In 1986, these corrupt tax bodies, were only collecting 4.23% of GDP as tax for the Government. The rest, they were collecting for themselves. We abolished these departments, created URA, which was manned by the people we got through integrity hunting before professional training. What did this mean? Take Allen Kagina, for instance, the present Commissioner-General (CG) of URA. She was a lecturer in Psychology at Makerere University. In fact, Allen Kagina protested that she did not know anything about tax collection. I told her that somebody would teach her because tax collection was not space science. What was lacking in those tax bodies was integrity and uprightness. By recruiting a new cadreship into the tax bodies, collection rose from 4% of GDP to the present 12.65% of GPD. It has stagnated at that level because of the subsistence nature of the economy but, possibly, also, the lack of a correct personal identification system which will be cured by the electronic identity card. Then, we turned to the Police, which has been slowly overhauled. This is how the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is now able to play an active role in the present anti-fraud campaign. I had to bring in two Generals from the Revolutionary Army - Katumba Wamala and Kale Kaihura í¢í‰ í‰  to shake up this centre of criminality that was ironically supposed to fight criminality. Recently, we deployed Jennifer Musisi in the rotten Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA). She is busy sweeping Aegean stables of Kampala - corruption, land grabbing, lack of planning, garbage, pot-holes, mud, dust, flooding, flies, etc. In the short time she has been in that office, you can see what impact she has created in spite of the opposition by the corrupt political class and bureaucrats. Recently, there have been quite a few politically motivated red-herrings, trying to give the impression that the problem of corruption in Uganda is because of lack of ""political will"" to fight that corruption. Who? Me, Yoweri Museveni, lacking ""political will"" to fight corruption and criminality when I am stronger now than I was in 1971, when, together with my colleagues, we took the regime of Idi Amin head on, or when in 1981, with 27 guns, we attacked Kabamba? Those who peddle those falsehoods should be treated with the contempt they deserve. As soon as we had the opportunity, we put all the necessary laws in place - leadership code, the anti-corruption laws, etc. We also put new institutions in place such as the Inspector General of Government (IGG), etc., in addition to the old ones such as CID, Director of Public Prosecution (DPP), etc. The problem has been the manning of these institutions. As all wars go, the enemy tries to infiltrate our ranks depending on the leadership that may be in place in a given institution. The IGG office, for instance, seems to have been infiltrated by questionable characters. The new IGG seems to be of the right temperament and integrity. She will mop up the infiltrators. Those who have been pushing the red-herring of lack of ""political will"" have been ignoring Article 174 of the Constitution, the Public Service Act of 2008 and section 188 of Local Government Act, all of which give power over money, contracts and personnel to the civil servants, not to politicians. In fact, there is no area of Government where the politicians can misuse money, make wrong procurement contracts, etc., without the permission of the civil servants (the Accounting officer). Where it happens, it is easy to detect. Therefore, as I have pointed out before, the warriors in the anti-corruption war are: the Permanent Secretary (PS) in the ministry, the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) in a district, the Town Clerk in a City or Municipality and the Gombolola chief in a sub-county. All the others are mere accessories to the crime. They are the ones to supervise the procurement officers, the accountants, etc., below them. Recently, we had a break through in this war. The whistle blowers in the ministry of Public Service exposed the huge theft of the pension funds. The CID moved in and they are doing a commendable job. Then, the Permanent Secretary of the Office of the Prime Minister became a whistle-blower in the case of the accountant Kazinda. This is what involved money from Development Partners. We are going to methodically unearth all those involved. I suspended the Permanent Secretary of the ministry of Public Service and I will suspend anybody else once I am satisfied that they are involved. The suspected thieves are very cunning. One of their techniques seems to be blackmail whereby they intimidate whistle-blowers with framing them up or trying to get political patronage. I can assure you none of those will work. I am the elected leader of Uganda for four consecutive terms apart from being the historical leader of the Ugandan Revolution. Anybody who associates himself or herself with these suspected thieves and tries to shield them will come to ruin as did all the enemies of our people. Our points-men in this war are the auditors, officers from CID officers and other security services. I, sometimes, directly supervise them. We shall not be diverted by any smoke-screen. Each issue will be dealt with according to the facts. As for the Development Partners, kindly inform your home constituencies that you are dealing with capable people who fought the dictatorship of Idi Amin; fought the dictatorship of UPC; defended Uganda from Sudanese - sponsored terrorism; destroyed the colonial Army that was killing Ugandans; stopped the multiple crimes of that Army against the people of Uganda; enabled the Ugandan economy to recover; contributed to regional peace, etc. The recent revelations have been made by people sympathetic to the Revolution. They are the whistle-blowers. We have the capacity to defeat these thieves as we defeated all the other enemies of Uganda. These accountants have for long been rumoured to be the core of corruption in the Public Service. Fortunately, given the large number of educated people Uganda now has, it will not be a big problem to get rid of this crop of parasites. Their activities even impact negatively on the operations of the foreign exchange. By getting this free money of the Government, they are able to buy large amount of dollars for externalization, thereby, causing the artificial depreciation of the Uganda shilling. The fight against these thieves is going on well. Give me your support and, please, remember the Banyankore proverb: ""Watooza n'ababwibire"". The rich African dialects are very precise and not easy to interpret. It refers to people stealing one's millet in the night from a granary. The following morning, having discovered the theft, you make the alarm. Among those who come to help track the stolen millet are the very thieves that stole the millet at night. They will do everything possible to divert you from the track that the thieves took so that you do not find the millet and the thieves. All that is said in two words as shown above. I thank you.

I don't exactly want to call it 50 because I was born in the Museveni regime, I love and will capitalize majorly on the 26 years I have personally experienced. The government has done a lot of great things; the peace that was ushered in came as relief from the past barbaric and out rightly atrocious governments of the past. There has been a huge transition in education; undeniably this government has seen the most educated people. Improved healthcare, road system, power development, rule of law and freedom of speech that the preceding governments tried to muzzle. Those are but a few fine works of this government. It has been a glimmer of hope, a huge leap towards a democratic government. But the same government has acceded corruption to blossom. Because of corruption many Ugandan are plagued by obscene poverty alongside stinking affluence. There is depravity, criminality, dejected roads, and extortion among other issues to loath. Crippled by the chains of poverty and inequality many Ugandans are literally financially exiled amidst a vast ocean of material prosperity. The plight is evident in the misery and pain of those that cannot afford justice, the many that can't access good health, those that love too but cannot get good education and those afflicted by natural disasters but help may never come. All these issues bring into sharp focus the evident flaws in most government institutions that have been swept by the whirling wind of corruption. It's obvious to seemingly think that all have drunk from the same cup, a cup of corruption that neutralizes good reason but instead nurtures a beastly behavior, mostly instinctive to satisfy self even if it puts at stake the lives of many other people. Our fellow countrymen don't mind about the plight of others but the wealth they draw from their suffering. Am not offering personal attacks and gauzy platitudes but highlighting the inexorable truth, a grim reality that begs for radical change. It's fatal to overlook need for urgent mutation. We cannot change the past 50yrs but we can change the 50yrs tread we just started. Now is the time to mellow out this fiasco of corruption moving forward full throttle to shout loud to all those that embezzle and misappropriate public funds. It's time to reverse the laxity, reinforce the laws and increase transparency. it's time to remove the blind fold be able to see the light as we move towards a warm threshold that leads us through a corruption free future. Let's all try make real the promise of democracy, be accountable for our deeds as we build the pearl of Africa Uganda. Yes we can change the future.

""The level of thieving in Uganda at present is beyond corruption but can be termed as terrorism, robbery, murder, kidnap, rebellion and devilish. We should improvise new measures which will cause the citizens to discriminate and make life hard for the corrupt,"" Bahati suggested. In a press statement he released on Thursday, Bahati proposed 8 radical measures the nation should undertake to wipe out corruption. He wants the religious leaders and believers to allow the corrupt in the places of worship only if they have turned up to repent and return what they have stolen as Zacchaeus the Tax Collector did in the Bible. Bahati, who is also the pastor of the Nsambya based Light Temple Ministries International Church, wants religious leaders to come out boldly and curse the corrupt. This regular panelist on the Vision Group's Urban TV also proposed the need to blacklist and hung the photos of the corrupt in the places of worship so people can shun them. He wants the children of the corrupt to only be baptized after repentance and bringing what they have stolen. ""We should not also burry them or their family members because they don't respect God. Those who robbed the funds for the people of northern Uganda who were terrorized by Kony is worse than Kony,"" he further proposed. Bahati wants the places of worship to also reject offertory, tithes and donations or any form of contribution from the corrupt. He wants the religious leaders to call upon market vendors, supermarkets, petrol stations, banks, and other business people never to render any service to these people who steal funds meant to improve the welfare of ordinary Ugandans. ""Nobody should invite them on the weddings or even attend their functions. By isolating these dangerous thieves at that level it will be an indication to the young people that stealing is bad."" Bahati also wants the ethics minister Fr. Simon Lokodo to resign arguing he has failed on his duty of mobilizing the citizens to rise up against corruption and other evils in the country. ""The ministry of ethics and integrity requires a more pragmatic and energetic person who will lay strategies of bringing back morals and ethics into Ugandans through crusades, workshops, adverts, and conferences,"" Bahati argued. He also wants MPs and all citizens to support John Ssimbwa's anti-corruption Bill which calls for harsh punishments for the corrupt including the confiscation of the property of the corrupt."306,New Vision (Kampala),11/30/2012,Mpigi Residents Demonstrate Against Corruption,,UGANDA (98%),,Newspaper,Francis Emorut,ENGLISH,EQUATOR (70%),1-Dec-12,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (92%)",297 words,CORRUPTION (98%); PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (78%); SCANDALS (73%); PRIME MINISTERS (67%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (67%); WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION (55%) Uganda; Corruption,"Residents of Kayabwe in Mpigi district have demonstrated against corruption, saying they have been deprived of quality services. The residents who marched along Kampala-Masaka highway held placards with different messages. The messages read: ""Inequality breeds corruption, how has corruption affected you?"" ""Listen to our voices, I am not corrupt why not you?"" ""Corruption is worse than AIDS"" ""Let's all fight against corruption"" ""What have you done to end corruption?"" ""The fight against corruption starts with you and protect whistle blowers"", among several others. The LC1 chairman of Kayabwe Equator, John Semakula called on the area to join those protesting against graft which has affected service delivery in the district. He said more awareness needs to be created in the community to join the fight against graft. The demo comes in the wake of scandalous revelations of alleged corrupt officials and their dealings in the office of the Prime Minister, which has effectively forced key donors to withdraw financial aid from Uganda. Mary Nantongo, a resident of the area said she was happy to join the demonstration because whenever she goes to a health centre, she is told by the health workers that there are no drugs. Rwampara MP Vincent Chamadidi, officials from Inspectorate of Government, Democratic Governance Facility and Uganda Debt Network joined the residents in the peaceful march against corruption. Chamididi urged residents to raise alarm whenever money is stolen in the district. ""Corruption is outright theft. Therefore, you should raise an alarm when money is stolen by district officials so that they are caught,"" he said. A mural installed by Uganda Debt Network was launched at the Equator in Kayabwe to raise awareness among the community on the war on corruption."307,New Vision (Kampala),12/8/2012,Corruption Is Unacceptable,,UNITED KINGDOM (98%); UGANDA (96%); AFRICA (79%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%),,Newspaper,Mark Lowcock,ENGLISH,,8-Dec-12,,645 words,CORRUPTION (90%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (90%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (90%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (89%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (79%); POLITICAL DEBATES (78%); PUBLIC FINANCE (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); POOR POPULATION (75%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (75%); PRIME MINISTERS (73%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (73%); MISAPPROPRIATION (71%); BANKING & FINANCE (67%); WOMEN'S HEALTH (65%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (63%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (63%); MALARIA (61%); ANNIVERSARIES (60%); ECONOMIC NEWS (50%) Uganda; Corruption,"Corruption in Uganda is not primarily an issue between the Government and the donors. It is above all an issue for Ugandans themselves. It is your national debate that really matters. In recent weeks, in both the UK and Uganda, media reporting about UK aid to Uganda has been focussed on corruption allegations in the Office of the Prime Minister. The public response to this situation in both countries has understandably been one of anger and disappointment. Misappropriation of public money allocated for the development of a country and its people is unacceptable and is unjustifiable to the public in the UK and in Uganda. Citizens in both countries have a right to assurances that precious resources spent by their Governments are used for the intended purpose - in this case improving the lives of the poorest people in Uganda. That is why the UK along with other donors in Uganda has had no choice but to suspend all direct financial aid channelled to the Government of Uganda. Any money that hasn't been used for the purpose for which it was intended must be returned. Until this happens, and action is taken against the people involved in this corruption, and donors have sufficient assurances that all of our aid will go towards helping poor people lift themselves out of poverty, financial aid channelled through Government will remain frozen. This doesn't mean, however, that the UK's commitment to supporting poverty reduction in Uganda has reduced. Far from it. Three quarters of the Œ£98 million (Ushs 392 billion) of UK aid to Uganda in this financial year is not channelled through Government systems and is unaffected by this suspension. The UK is funding programmes through the United Nations Agencies, non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and other agencies. These programmes are supporting progress in key areas of Uganda's National Development Plan including in infrastructure, trade, financial services, maternal health, family planning, and support for victims of gender based violence. New UK funded programmes are currently under development to help Uganda adapt to a changing climate, fight malaria and expand regional economic integration across East Africa. I have been visiting Uganda now for 15 years. It is a pleasure to return here this week as the United Kingdom Department for International Development's Permanent Secretary in a year when both Uganda and I turned 50 years of age. A useful feature of anniversaries and milestones such as 50th birthdays is that they encourage us to stand back and look at things against a longer perspective than the here and now around which much of modern life revolves. As I commented in a speech at a seminar hosted by the Economic Policy Research Centre this week, the grandparents of today's 50 year olds could scarcely have conceived where we would be today. In the last 50 years, global life expectancy has risen from 47 years on average to 67 years. 3G Smartphones on sale here for $100 in Kampala today enable a Ugandan to access more information than was in any library in the world 20 years ago. The progress made in Uganda in the last 50 years is testament to the resilience of its people. It is currently a country free from conflict and with an impressive record on economic growth. The UK is proud to be a partner to Uganda in its development. In the last 10 years alone, the UK has provided more than four trillion Ugandan shillings in development assistance to support Uganda in its efforts to reduce poverty, increase access to services and infrastructure, and promote growth and prosperity. I remain very optimistic about the future trajectory of development in Uganda for three reasons - your natural resources, your growing democracy, but most importantly Uganda's people. And the UK remains committed to continuing its support to help Uganda and its people achieve their potential."308,New Vision (Kampala),12/11/2012,Uganda's Health Sector Tops Corruption Index,,"UGANDA (94%); EASTERN AFRICA (93%); AFRICA (90%); RWANDA (79%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (79%); KENYA (79%)",,Newspaper,Anne Mugisa,ENGLISH,,12-Dec-12,,273 words,CORRUPTION (94%); HEALTH CARE (91%); BRIBERY (90%); HEALTH CARE SECTOR PERFORMANCE (90%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (73%); POLICE FORCES (56%); ECONOMIC NEWS (50%) Uganda; Corruption; Health and Medicine,"Uganda's health sector is the most corrupt in the East African region, a report released by the Inspectorate of Government (IGG) has said. The report, released to mark the International Anti-Corruption Day, said the sector is fraught with bribery and absenteeism, effectively undermining the population's health and realisation of the Millennium Development Goals. The report also said there were indicators that bribery remained high in the water sector, obtaining permits for investments, in the police force and in the judiciary between 2008 and 2012. Uganda's bribery prevalence rate in medical services is more than three times that of Kenya and almost twice that of Tanzania. Bribery in the health sector is also significantly higher than that in the education sector. ""Having a high rate of bribery introduces inefficiencies, unfairness, discrimination and unlawfulness in a critical component of the state's responsibility of providing services and care for its population,"" the report said. ""Quiet corruption in the healthcare sector is widespread. Health workers absenteeism is highest at health centre III facility level and has since increased from 46.2% in 2009/10 to 51% in 2010/11,"" it added. It also said Rwanda's bribery rate of 0.1% sets a good example to its East African neighbours and suggests that the fight against corruption and bribery can be won. The IGG, Justice Irene Mulyagonja, said the report was compiled using secondary data collected by the Economic Policy Research Centre, a data tracking mechanism on behalf of the inspectorate. Mulyagonja said corruption is one of the major factors affecting governance in Africa."309,New Vision (Kampala),12/12/2012,Opposing Corruption Is the Patriot's Highest Obligation [opinion],,UGANDA (92%),,Newspaper,Lulu Itipa,ENGLISH,,12-Dec-12,,369 words,LEGISLATIVE BODIES (91%); CORRUPTION (91%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (78%); PRIME MINISTERS (73%); BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (70%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (70%) Uganda; Corruption,"THE American scholar G. Edward Griffin said, ""To oppose corruption in government is the highest obligation of patriotism."" Griffin's observation carries two interesting phrases: ""in government"" and ""highest obligation of patriotism"". Griffin is correct but in part to imply that corruption is only in the Government or can be opposed in government. But what constitutes government in which exists corruption? The Executive, Legislature and Judiciary broadly constitute the government. So, there is corruption in the Executive - meaning corruption in the presidency, vice-presidency and Cabinet. What composes parliament? Those elected by universal suffrage and special interest groups. Consequently, in the Offices of the speaker, deputy speaker and Members of Parliament (MPs) exists corruption. The chief justice, deputy chief justice, judges of the supreme, appeal and high courts have the corrupt within their ranks. Altogether they are the judiciary. Numerous offices combine to constitute the presidency, vice-presidency and cabinet. Similarly, the speaker, deputy speaker, MPs, clerk to parliament, chief justice, deputy chief justice and judges each head elaborate institutional structures. Within and amongst themselves, these organs too interact and interact. In these entire set-ups and functions prowl the corrupt, ask Griffin. So, no wonder that the current corruption allegations engulfing the Offi ce of the Prime Minister, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Public Service, Bank of Uganda, etc are all institutions found in the Government. But then there are the likes of Bad Black, Meddie Sentongo or Nandala Mafabi's ""thieves"" in FDC. Does it connote that those in the Government directly or by osmosis 'infected' them with the malady? Griffin is of the conviction that to oppose corruption is the highest obligation of patriotism. Indeed because patriotism is strategic but the government is tactical to a country! Also, some in the Government are patriotic just as some outside the Government are corrupt: they all live webbed together in one country. That is why Griffin should have said, ""To oppose corruption is the highest obligation of patriotism"".

""In addition, the Auditor General is undertaking another audit on pension payment under ministry of public service following the alleged fraud of sh63 billion,"" Namayanja said. In a statement, she said that measures have been put in place to control donor disbursements within Bank of Uganda and the national treasury. ""All flows will first be remitted to the consolidated Fund Appropriation Account before the funds are transmitted to beneficiary accounts, instead of suspense accounts."" As part of the measures, Bank of Uganda and Ministry of Finance signed a memorandum of understanding to close all dormant project accounts in the central bank. The finance ministry is to also install hardware to control use of passwords for sensitive roles, supervised by the Internal Audit unit. Also, statements from Bank of Uganda are to be submitted directly to Accountant General to carry out monthly reconciliation of statements. All accounting officers are required to make reconciliations and submit reports on a monthly basis. The ministry of public service has been directed to reconcile and clean up salary and pension payroll to remove all ghosts. Also, Government is to ensure that the pension and salary payrolls are migrated to the Integrated Personnel and Payroll System (IPPS) by end of this year, to eliminate diversion of funds. The interim minister also said that Government is regularly rotating staff who are directly involved in the management of Government resources such as Accountants, procurement Officers. ""Other administrative and legal means to punish the perpetrators and recover the funds are on course. ""This includes freezing of all the accounts referred to in the Auditor General's report. Government calls upon all players and partners in development to tighten this noble war of fighting corruption,"" Namayanja said."311,New Vision (Kampala),12/30/2012,Religious Leaders Want Corruption-Free 2013,,UGANDA (99%),,Newspaper,Juliet Lukwago,ENGLISH,,31-Dec-12,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (91%)",392 words,RELIGION (99%); CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY (92%); MUSLIMS & ISLAM (90%); CLERGY & RELIGIOUS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); CATHOLICS & CATHOLICISM (79%); PROTESTANTS & PROTESTANTISM (79%); CIVIL RIGHTS (77%); WITCHCRAFT (74%) Uganda; Corruption; Religion,"Religious leaders in Uganda have appealed to the Government and all Ugandans to make 2013 a year free of corruption. Christian and Muslim religious leaders who spoke to Sunday Vision highlighted corruption as one of Uganda's leading problems. The Catholic Archbishop of Kampala, Dr. Cyprian Kizito Lwanga, said corruption denies citizens their rights and entitlements. ""I shall never get tired of condemning corruption through which our country is losing billions every year. I continue to appeal to the conscience of our leaders and the public to do all we can to uproot this evil from our midst,"" he said. Lwanga also called for peace, reconciliation, mutual respect, justice and forgiveness among Ugandans. The Archbishop of the Church of Uganda, Stanley Ntagali, asked political leaders to do everything in their power to curb corruption. He called upon Ugandans to repent and join efforts to fight corruption. He also urged Christians to seek God's guidance in their social, economic and political routines so as to avoid problems, adding that corruption is just a symptom of the social evils that are deep-rooted in Uganda. Archbishop Ntagali also asked the Government to continually address citizens' concerns to ensure peace and harmony in the country. He noted that many people have given up hope and faith in God, due to the existing social ills. Sheikh Nuuhu Muzaata Batte, a key leader in the Kibuli-based Muslim faction, said Ugandans should return to God to avoid evils like corruption and child sacrifice. He added that political leaders should respect the rights of citizens and be exemplary in their behaviour. ""Forgetting all past deeds and entering into New Year gives you hope and confidence for a fresh start,"" he said. Pastor John Kakembo of the Seven's Day Adventist Church in Uganda decried selfishness and urged MPs to fight on against corruption. ""I pray for a better Uganda come 2013 so that we avoid corruption in all corners,"" he said. Pastor Martin Ssempa called upon Ugandans to shun corruption, witchcraft, sexual immorality, greed and selfishness. He commended the Government for the steps taken so far in fighting corruption, but called for more efforts. ""Corruption in this country means one Ugandan is stealing from another Ugandan. We are doing these things to ourselves,"" he said.

The two cases that are being played out in the press - the corruption in the Office of the Prime Minister and the public service ministry, suggest that as much sh200b has gone missing. This massive transfer of tax payers' money into the pockets of a few colluding officials is hard to justify when one considers how much such sums could do for the wider community in terms of providing health, education and other services. As the business community, society may think we are far removed from the malaise but that is not true. Hundreds of our members come in touch with this side of Ugandan officialdom, which extracts additional payment from honest businessmen for services already paid for by tax payers' money. This is an added cost to doing business that we hesitantly pass on to the consumer, knowing all too well it could affect demand for our goods and services. Is it any wonder that unscrupulous businessmen have sprung up who source inferior goods, which they calculate they can still price competitively even after the bribes have been factored in, dooming the end consumer to a lower standard of living than he deserves. On another level all this ""free"" money has been inflating property prices around town making doing business in Kampala more expensive than it should be. So we have to pay more to buy land to situate our factories or real estate or to rent premises, these larger than normal costs are eating at our margins and often means the final consumer is paying more for his goods and services. Essentially, there is no level playing field, the market is being distorted by this ""free"" money and causing unnecessary casualties to our membership. These are, but a few ways corruption is making doing business in Uganda difficult and making it difficult to compete against foreign entrants into the market. This is dangerous. Studies globally have shown that most of the new jobs created in an economy come from the SMEs, at the same time this group of business is particularly vulnerable to external shocks, unable to contend with, they normally go under taking the nobs they have created with them. Clearly, something has got to give. It has been clear to the business community for quite some time that this economy will always struggle as long as corruption is not contained or eliminated altogether. We acknowledge that these corruption scams were unearthed by the Government internal processes and we are grateful for this, but we urge the Government to stay the course, not to be side-tracked by parochial interests in chasing down the perpetrators of these grand thefts. Out of conviction and necessity, we are strong believers in the Government's policies to ensure the private sector is the engine of economic growth and we are, therefore, against any policies or practices that do not promise to fulfill this goal. We at the Uganda National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (UNCCI) know we can be many times more productive, if certain barriers are lowered or eradicated altogether. Corruption is one such impediment. We would be the last people to oppose wealth accumulation, but only if it is done openly and in manner that doesn't unfairly disadvantage others. UNCCI is strongly behind the Government in its fight against corruption.

In his New Year message, the President attributed the slow economic growth during 2012 to the European economic crisis, political saboteurs and corrupt officials. ""In this coming year, the patriots of Uganda will have to confront these two saboteurs: the myopic political, administrative group and the corrupt officials, who delay our industrialisation vision. No modern country can prosper by agriculture alone. I have told you this many times. These delays for industrial projects can spell a disaster for Uganda if they are not resolutely resisted and defeated,"" Museveni said ""Where will the youth get jobs from? How shall we expand the tax base beyond where it is now? How shall we expand export earnings so that we defend the shilling from depreciation as it did last year to sh2,900 per dollar?"" the President asked. Citing the Lugazi sugar expansion project and the Amuru sugar project, the President noted that a number of Ugandan Indians, who have been active in manufacturing, face many politically generated obstacles in implementing industrial projects. He also quoted an Egyptian investor, who is building an abattoir, saying he has wasted a lot of time on the account of some government officials. ""You, therefore, end up with a triple headed problem: Indigenous Ugandans do not invest in manufacturing because they lack the knowledge and the money, while the Ugandan Indians are delayed by politically motivated schemes. Foreign investors are either delayed or deterred by corrupt or indifferent government officials,"" he said. Museveni said last year, the country experienced high inflation rate due to missed opportunities in the lucrative regional export opportunities as well as feeding the internal market. He noted that the years 2011 and 2012 were full of economic challenges, but also of economic opportunities for Uganda. ""Inflation went up to 30%. Was this bad for Uganda? Not at all. It was only bad because some of the Ugandan leaders (political and administrative) have delayed our industrialisation plan,"" the President said. He attributed the challenges partly to the global crisis in Europe and the USA, leading to a 50% drop in export. Europe and USA are the biggest consumers of Ugandan raw materials and source of tourists. ""Europeans are no longer buying as many of our products as they used to because they do not have the money,"" Museveni said. He, however, said Uganda is lucky that regional demand in the Great Lakes was growing rapidly before the insecurity in eastern Congo interfered with the flow of business. The President noted that despite the peace created by NRM, Ugandans have not fully exploited the advantages. This, he said, was mainly due to internal indiscipline especially by some politicians as well as other elements in the society."314,New Vision (Kampala),1/3/2013,Corruption Has No Party [opinion],,UGANDA (96%),,Newspaper,Samuel Oduny,ENGLISH,,3-Jan-13,,541 words,CORRUPTION (90%); REBELLIONS & INSURGENCIES (90%); WAR & CONFLICT (90%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); PRIME MINISTERS (78%); APPOINTMENTS (72%); BAIL (61%) Uganda; Corruption; Governance; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE rampant corruption in the country has no political party contrary to what some people are trying to say and it has no link to the NRM party. Parliament of Uganda has so far spent a lot of time debating the billions of money claimed to be lost in the Office of the Prime Minister but has never come out with a way forward to the problem. When we are fighting corruption in Uganda we should not associate it with any political party. We should all come out and reject the few people who are deliberately swindling funds that are meant for various developmental purposes. It is very sad to hear that 50 billion meant to rehabilitate the war ravaged region of northern Uganda which suffered from the notorious Joseph Kony insurgency has been stolen by the big shots in the Prime Minister's Office. When war broke out in northern Uganda in 1986, President Museveni appointed Mrs. Betty Bigombe to make sure the war came to an end. Mrs.Bigombe did her best to talk to the rebels to stop war in the region. With the support of UPDF the war eventually came to an end. What came next was to look for money to rehabilitate the people of the region who suffered for 20 years of insurgency. It sounds awkward when people who are meant to be technical in running the day to day work in Government Offices just decide to divert the funds for aggrandizement without caring that the people of northern Uganda suffered in the hands of Kony and his henchmen. Unless the people of Uganda realize that it should be a collective work to fight corruption, the country may never fully fight the vice. Even if corruption is carried out by big shots or lower people in Government the act will remain corruption. When we label this corruption to be an NRM vise as a political party, then we are not on the way to solve the issue. The laws of the country that allow court bail has so far become a big problem in fighting corruption in Uganda and that is the reason most of the corrupt elements get themselves out of prisons. In the case of some NRM members who are involved in current corruption case in the OPM, the party should take a serious action against them or call a party delegates conference so that members discuss the way forward. Delegates Conference of a party is important to correct weaknesses in the system. Northern Uganda is a region that in a normal situation should have had a full cabinet Minister so that whichever funds that is meant for the area could be handled by such an office. Comparatively speaking we would equate the region to Karamoja that has a full Cabinet minister in the name of the First Lady, Janet Museveni. Karamoja region for some time had State Ministers but currently it has been uplifted to have a Cabinet minister. Leaving northern Uganda in the general Office of the Prime Minister will always mean throwing the money into the hands of unreliable people who do not know how much the region suffered during the insurgency and still continues to suffer up to date. Well I appeal to the people of Uganda to appreciate the great work done by the NRM Government. The corrupt people in the Government Offices are just trying to tarnish the achievements so far made in the last 20 years and beyond.

The withdrawal of the aid, which amounts to 1.3 percent of GDP, threatens the economy's recovery from a sharp slowdown in the 2011/12 fiscal year that was caused by soaring inflation and a currency slump. Growth fell to 3.4 percent that fiscal year from 6.7 percent in the previous period as inflation peaked at 30 percent and the shilling hit record lows against the dollar, driving up prices of basic commodities and sparking widespread protests. The government expects the economy to expand by 4.3 percent this fiscal year, well below its medium-term potential of around seven percent. The finance ministry told the International Monetary Fund in a letter of intent it would also cut 0.8 percent of the gross domestic product in expenditure, mainly in development spending. ""These actions (higher borrowing) will increase the fiscal burden to Government due to higher interest rates which will translate into higher cost of borrowing to the private sector,"" the ministry said in the letter published on Wednesday. ""This will contribute to reduce the pace of economic recovery in the short term."" The increased borrowing would be through issuance of government securities, the ministry said. The absolute level of planned borrowing was not available immediately but the nation of 33 million people has a GDP of about $17 billion. Finance Minister Maria Kiwanuka had set the spending for the 2012/13 fiscal year, which runs from July to June, at 8.1 trillion shillings in her budget speech last June. The finance ministry said recurrent spending would only be cut moderately because it had dropped to 10.3 percent of GDP this fiscal year from 11.2 percent in 2011/12."317,New Vision (Kampala),3/16/2013,Judge Sebutinde Cautions Women On Corruption,,UGANDA (96%); NETHERLANDS (90%),,Newspaper,Gloria Nakajubi,ENGLISH,,18-Mar-13,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (92%)",470 words,CORRUPTION (93%); INTERNATIONAL COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); WOMEN (78%); FEMINISM & WOMEN'S RIGHTS (78%); INTERNATIONAL LAW (78%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (73%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (73%); CIVIL SERVICES (71%); RURAL COMMUNITIES (69%); PREGNANCY & CHILDBIRTH (69%); COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS (64%); HOTELS & MOTELS (50%) Uganda; Women and Gender; Corruption,"Judge Julia Sebutinde has cautioned Ugandan women against involving themselves in any acts of corruption. A judge on the International Court of Justice, the Ugandan jurist told women to keep a distance from corrupt tendencies in their various offices and capacities of service. She said that since women today are taking up various positions in the field of service, they can easily be susceptible to the temptations that come along with holding offices of responsibility. When lured into corruption-related misdeeds, she said, women become a part of the corruption rot in the country. She sees women as mothers who should look to portraying the acceptable values to their children if the future generation is to be corruption free. ""It is not academic, career achievements or trophies that count when a mother passes on, but the kind of children she has raised is what does."" True, as in contemporary society, a child's success or failure is always pointed to his upbringing. The jurist's call comes in the wake of various corruption investigations presently being carried out in the Parliament and Police with a number of public servants linked to mismanagement of taxpayers' money. Sebutinde, the first African woman to sit on the World Court, was speaking at a Women's Day banquet organized by the Business Day Communications at the Serena Hotel in Kampala this week. The function was also supported by the Ministry of Gender and Cultural Issues. Trade and industry minister Amelia Kyambadde, also in attendance, urged all emancipated women to help the rural poor women who are less privileged. ""It doesn't make a difference if we say we have been emancipated yet there is a woman in rural Uganda that cannot access health services and ends up dying in the hands of traditional birth attendants,"" she reasoned. She urged all the privileged women in urban area to find a way of helping the rural poor woman improve their lives especially by empowering them with skills and guidance because most of them lack knowledge and information. ""In every position a woman should use it as a platform to improve the life of the woman who is less privileged other than blocking them."" During the function 50 goats were handed over to women in the districts of Amuria,Gulu and Mayuge to help boost their incomes. Despite the spirited drive towards women emancipation in Uganda today, there still remains a gendered divide. In most parts of the country, women remain submissive to men and have to tolerate roles like housekeeping, child rearing, fetching water, cooking, among others. But while some women have come out strongly in the open against such pressure, others have become accustomed to being treated inferior to men. But corruption remains deeply rooted in the country's system, with men at the forefront of most of the corruption cases."318,New Vision (Kampala),3/26/2013,Uganda Management Institue to Start Anti-Corruption Course,,"UGANDA (96%); EASTERN AFRICA (92%); RWANDA (79%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (79%); KENYA (79%)",,Newspaper,Moses Walubiri,ENGLISH,,26-Mar-13,,444 words,CORRUPTION (90%); MANAGER TRAINING (90%); GRADUATE & PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS (90%); BRIBERY (89%); EMPLOYEE TRAINING (89%); HEALTH CARE (78%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (78%); CONSULTING SERVICES (78%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (77%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (77%); CIVIL SERVICES (75%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (74%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION GRADUATION (73%); SCANDALS (72%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (71%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (69%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (65%) Uganda; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Governance,"Uganda Management Institute (UMI) - deemed Uganda's premier center for management training, consultancy and research - is set to roll out a course in anti-graft management as a way of stemming the rising tide of corruption in the country. The course is among those that the institute is designing as it seeks to remain relevant to the ""challenges of the 21st Century,"" according to its Director General, Dr. James Nkata. ""We receive misgivings from the public that UMI has veered off its original purpose of fostering capacity building among civil servants. But that is not true as evidenced by the kind of courses we offer, including the one on anti-corruption management that is under design,"" Nkata said to prolonged laughter and clapping during UMI's 11th graduation ceremony on Friday. Another course that will be rolled out later this year is Hospital and Healthcare Management, which, according to Nkata, is meant for practicing and aspiring health managers. UMI Chancellor, Florence Mugasha, whose term of office expires in June, reminisced on the highs and lows of her tenure, highlighting the opening of UMI branches in Mbale and Mbarara as the biggest achievements. The institute awarded 1849 students with Ordinary Diplomas, Postgraduate Diplomas and Masters Degrees, the largest number to graduate in a single go in its 44 years history. Mugasha challenged the graduands to make a ""positive influence on society"" with their newly acquired skills, saying UMI alumni are ""never second best in any realm of human endeavor."" According to Transparency International, a global civil society organization leading the fight against graft, Uganda loses more money through corruption annually than it receives in foreign aid and grants. The latest East African Bribery Index conducted by Transparency International indicates that Uganda has the highest bribery index in the region at 40.7, compared to Tanzania (39.1), Kenya (29.5), and Rwanda at 2.5 per cent. This means that to access most of the essential services in Uganda, one is more likely to fork out a bribe than in any other East African country. Also the latest Perception Corruption Index carried out in 176 countries ranks Uganda as the 46th most corrupt country in the world. This development comes at a time when the country is in the throes of numerous corruption scandals and all manner of abuse of office that have left state coffers bleeding white. Set up in 1969 as the Institute of Public Administration with a mandate to provide in-service training to public servants, the institute had its mandate changed in 1992 to reflect its broader role in development management, getting renamed UMI in the process."319,New Vision (Kampala),3/28/2013,Cameras to Monitor Corruption At Weigh Bridges,,UGANDA (96%),,Newspaper,Billy Rwothungeyo,ENGLISH,,28-Mar-13,,415 words,TRUCKING WEIGH STATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); TRUCK DRIVERS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE (78%); COMPUTER NETWORKS (78%); FINES & PENALTIES (78%); ROAD & BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION (78%); TELEVISION INDUSTRY (77%); SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY (76%); EXTORTION (73%); OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION (70%); PURCHASING & PROCUREMENT (70%); MAINTENANCE & REPAIR (68%); HIGHWAYS & STREETS (50%) Uganda; Corruption; Industry and Infrastructure,"In a bid to increase truck drivers' compliance and further the fight against fraud, the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) intends to install networked devices at its weigh bridges at Busitema, Lukaya and Mbale stations. ""We have had several complaints from truckers on a wide range of issues such as delays and corruption at our weigh bridges. This system allows us to monitor activities and record what is going on,"" Dan Alinange, UNRA's head of corporate communications said. The procurement process for the supply, delivery and commissioning of Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) and Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) devices at the three stations is underway. If there are no hiccups, the contract will be awarded in June. The weigh bridge act of 2008 was introduced to safeguard the national road network, whose maintenance cost is ever increasing. However, implementation of the act has often come under criticism. Two years ago, transporters rose up in arms against the weigh bridge system and petitioned Parliament over the system's inefficiencies. Earlier in 2009, then works minister, John Nasasira suspended the system following corruption allegations. Drivers claimed the system was manipulated in order to extort money from them. With the installation of these networked systems at the Luwero, Mbarara, Mubende and Busia stations, transparency levels increased. Statistics from UNRA indicate that of the 7,877 vehicles that were weighed at the weigh bridges in the first half of this financial year, 446 were found to be overloaded. Further figures reveal that between January and March, Busitema weigh bridge station recorded the highest number of axle load regulation violations, while Luwero recorded the highest number of vehicles which were grossly overloaded. Most of the offenders are truck haulers carrying general merchandise, mainly foodstuffs and building materials destined for South Sudan. Alinange however, says the onus of maintaining road infrastructure is the responsibility of every stakeholder. ""The onus of complying with the law rests is upon all parties involved in the transportation of freight. These include the operator, consignor and consignee, all of whom suffer the inconvenience from non-compliance,"" he said. Alinange added: ""What they (offenders) pay to the Government is very low in relation to the cost of the damage and is not really a deterrent to overloading. Indeed, it favours operators to deliberately overload and pay relatively low fines."""320,New Vision (Kampala),4/19/2013,"Corruption Is Endangering Lives, Says Banyenzaki",,UGANDA (94%); GERMANY (79%); NORWAY (79%); EUROPE (79%); AFRICA (79%); DENMARK (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (55%),,Newspaper,Moses Mulondo & Paul Kiwuuwa,ENGLISH,,19-Apr-13,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (79%)",626 words,CORRUPTION (91%); NATURAL DISASTERS (90%); FORESTRY & ENVIRONMENT (90%); TALKS & MEETINGS (89%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (89%); DEVELOPMENT BANKS (89%); RISK MANAGEMENT (89%); EUROPEAN UNION (78%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (78%); DISASTER PLANNING (77%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (76%); DEFORESTATION (76%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (76%); ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES (75%); METEOROLOGY (73%); MILITARY WEAPONS (72%); HOTELS & MOTELS (71%); PRIME MINISTERS (70%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (68%) Uganda; Corruption; Governance,"The minister for economic monitoring and research has sounded a wake-up call to the nation to intensify the fight against corruption to solve most of the country's problems. Among the several problems Uganda is grappling with is poverty and ill disaster preparedness. Minister Henry Banyenzaki touched on the issue during a conference for generating ideas for disaster preparedness for the post 2015 Millennium Development Goals at Metropole Hotel on Wednesday. He was the guest of honour. Whereas most of the natural disasters have been linked to environmental degradation, corruption tendencies have frustrated government efforts to stop deforestation and to promote forestation, stressed Banyenzaki. ""The president has frozen the money for the National Forestry Authority (NFA) because billions of money sent there had been stolen. ""You remember that one of the directors of NFA was found was billions of money under his bed pillow. This is very unfortunate."" Also MP for Rubanda County West, Banyenzaki condemned the theft of billions of money in the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), public service ministry and other ministries. According to him, those implicated in these theft scandals are the enemies of Uganda's development. The swindling of money from the OPM inspired the withdrawal of funding from key donors, including Germany, Denmark, European Union, World Bank, among others. The minister's call, directed to various players committed to averting disasters, is to sensitize the ordinary citizens about the causes of the disasters. His emphasis dwelt on the need to enhance good governance and accountability, during which he attributed many disasters in Africa to bad governance - which, he said, results into deadly and costly wars. ""If we can be able to undertake measures which will guarantee sustainable peace, it means we shall save the money we are now spending on purchasing military weapons and use it to improve the socioeconomic standards of our people,"" he elaborated. Through his recent initiatives in the international fora as chairman for parliamentary forum on International Monetary Fund and World Bank, Banyenzaki said he has influenced the international community to involve MPs in the formulation of the post 2015 Millennium Development Goals. The chairman for the parliamentary forum on disaster risk reduction, Alex Byarugaba, who chaired the conference, appealed to government to install the necessary early warning equipment in the meteorology department to increase the country's ability to avert disasters. Byarugaba further called on government to carry out a mass public campaign to sensitize the citizens on human activities which endanger the environment and make them prone to natural calamities. The one-day consultative conference which gathered participants from government, civil society and development partners, was funded by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). ""Disasters in Uganda and in the rest of the world are on the rise,"" said NRC's Tine Ramstad. ""The post-2015 framework for disaster risk reduction should offer the opportunity to further scale-up disaster risk reduction efforts for all those who have forced out of their homes."" Without divulging into details, Ramstad said NRC, which has been helping over 30,000 Internally Displaced Persons mostly in Northern Uganda, would wind up business in Uganda at the end of this year. Among the resolutions passed by the conference include the need to enhance research on the causes of disasters in Uganda, strengthening early warning, increase public awareness on disasters and their causes. Others include: allocating more resources for prevention and mitigation of disasters, and the need purchase modern equipment for Uganda's meteorology department, and many more."321,New Vision (Kampala),4/23/2013,Uganda Export Promotions Board Probed Over Corruption,,UGANDA (94%); CHINA (92%); SUDAN (79%),,Newspaper,Steven Candia,ENGLISH,EAST CHINA (78%),26-Apr-13,"SHANGHAI, CHINA (78%)",643 words,EXPORT TRADE (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); EXPORT PROMOTION (90%); TRADE SHOWS (89%); TRADE DEVELOPMENT (89%); TRANSLATORS & INTERPRETERS (88%); EXECUTIVES (88%); ACCOUNTING (78%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (78%); PUBLIC CONTRACTS LAW (77%); PAINTING (75%); INTERNATIONAL TRADE (73%); DIVESTITURES (71%); BUDGETS (71%) Uganda; Governance; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Trade; Corruption,"The Procurement Authority has written to police probing alleged corruption in the Uganda Export Promotions Board (UEPB), to ensure that proper procedures were adhered to in the procurement of certain contentious items by the entity. In a letter to the criminal intelligence and investigations directorate boss dated February 26, the Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Authority (PPDA) noted that it was important for the investigators to ascertain that procurement procedures had been adhered to. The letter follows an earlier request by the police seeking guidance on a number of issues under probe, among them the procurement of a mural for an exhibition at sh12.7m; procuring services for content development and translation services at sh6.4m and the hiring of cultural performers to entertain guests at sh3.1m. In the response signed by Cornelia Sabiti, the Executive Director PPDA directed the police to among others task that procurement unit of the board on the matter. ""The procurement and disposal unit is required to confirm that the items are provide fro in the entity's procurement plan and are budgeted for in the approved budget for the financial years in accordance with the PPDA Regulation 105,"" the letter signed by Sabiti reads. The letter also noted that the authority was required to initiate procurements using PP form 20 in keeping with PPDA regulations, which were contravened. The board used competitive bidding in relation to murals deal and direct bidding for the services of a Chinese translator, which police say, basing on the guidelines stipulated by PPDA was wrong. CIID boss Grace Akullo could not be reached for comment as she was reported away attending a national function. However, police sources yesterday said detectives probing the alleged scam had established after questioning members of the disposal unit that procedures had been seriously flouted. According to investigation the mural was procured at sh12,746,400 for the Chinese Expo 2010, to depict the theme: a better city a better life while the content development and translation services were procured at sh6,422,650 and the cultural performers to entertain a Chinese delegation that visited Uganda at sh3,119,500. The police last year launched a probe into the export promotions board over allegations involving several top officials, including the executive director, Florence Kata estimated at over sh50m, part of a wider probe into money spent on various trade fairs abroad. The money was spent in the financial years 2009/10, 2010/11 and 2011/12 and allegedly misused. The alleged flouting of procedures, sources said, adversely affects three top officials of the board-Kata, who also doubled as the accounting officer; the director finance Fred Kibedi and the procurement officer, Anne Karungi. In the period under probe, the board participated in three expos-the Shanghai Expo in China, the International Trade Fair and exhibition in South Sudan and the Yeosu Trade Fair in South Korea. Kata is also being probed over allegations that she irregularly appointed William Babigumira as her deputy without the consent of the board which investigators say amounts to abuse of office. ""They have sought the interpretation of the director of public prosecution (DPP) over the matter. Kata and Babigumira have since appeared before the police in connection with the allegations. The police are also probing allegations that Kata's son, Lionel Barigye was among the people the board funded for a trade fair in Germany, culminating in his company receiving a refund of sh 2m as a 50% refund of fund used in travel and accommodation. Barigye's company, Cyber Agricultural Produce (CAP) International Limited, received about sh2m as a 50% refund of funds used for travel and accommodation to attend the Fruit Logistica fair from February 8 to 10, 2012 in Germany."322,New Vision (Kampala),5/16/2013,Kadaga Wants Anti-Corruption Campaign in Schools,,UGANDA (94%),,Newspaper,Paul Kiwuuwa,ENGLISH,,17-May-13,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (90%)",350 words,CORRUPTION (93%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (90%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (90%); CHILDREN (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); PRIMARY SCHOOLS (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION (78%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (78%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (77%); YOUTH SPORTS (76%); WOMEN WORKERS (73%); SCHOOL PRINCIPALS (73%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (73%); EDUCATION ADMINISTRATION (73%); SEXUAL HARASSMENT (71%); TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE (67%); WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION (66%); UNEMPLOYMENT RATES (65%); ECONOMIC NEWS (65%); SECONDARY SCHOOLS (56%) Uganda; Corruption; Education,"The battle against corruption should be taken to schools in order to confront the vice at an early stage, Parliament Speaker, Rebecca Kadaga, has said.

The book was authored by Herbert Ssali, under the auspices of the ""Anti-corruption Youth team."" ""We want to sensitize students from primary and secondary schools about corruption and its effects, when they are not yet spoiled by the evil.

Kadaga mentioned forms of corruption including: theft of public resources, donor funds, parents paying off head teachers for admission of children in schools, buying fake academic qualifications in institutions, sexual harassment by male or female teachers to pupils or students. ""I call up on students to form anti-corruptions clubs, through drama acting, music, dance, games and sports, to highlight corruption as a hindrance to economic development."" she added. The 50 paged books said: ""The only sure anti-dote to corruption is by knowing it, avoiding it, evading it and fighting it."" Ssali pledged to distribute free anti-corruption books to 50 schools in Kampala and Wakiso districts. He said they contributed from the smaller incomes they earn to print the books. The book highlights factors that pave way for corruption in Uganda as: Lack of protection to whistle blowers or people who raises a concern, increased unemployment, low payment at work places, demand people demand to immerse wealth not worked for, and weak government policies against corruption. Ssali pointed out that corruption has contributed to poor education, and deteriorating facilities, poor roads and infrastructure among others."323,New Vision (Kampala),5/17/2013,Pader LC5 Councillors Arrested Over Corruption,,UGANDA (79%),,Newspaper,Denis Ojwee,ENGLISH,,17-May-13,,390 words,CORRUPTION (92%); ARRESTS (91%); POLICE FORCES (90%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (89%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (78%); CIVIL SERVICES (78%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (78%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS (76%); TALKS & MEETINGS (65%); DISMISSALS (64%); EXECUTIVES (52%) Uganda; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"The Police in Pader are holding three LC 5 councillors who were arrested over alleged corruption cases worth sh6m.

Akena is the chairman of finance, planning and administration, works and technical services. All the three sub-counties are in Aruu County in Pader district. The Aswa regional police spokesman, Patrick Jimmy Okema, confirmed that the trio was arrested on Friday morning from different places through phone tracking. He said the Police also collected printouts from MTN telecom that showed transaction and verbal communications between them and the CAO over that period. He revealed that the trio is facing corruption charges as preferred against them by the Resident State Attorney under case file number CRB 136/2013. He said the trio has allegedly fallen victims to Anti-corruption Act, section 2 (a) and 26. Okema disclosed that the trio is being accused of allegedly soliciting for sh6m from the Pader Chief Administrative Officer, Grandfield Oryono Omonda. He said this took place between the months of July and October 2012. The Police disclosed that the Pajule LC5 Councillor, Oringa had in the 61st Pader district council meeting (June 14-15, 2012) moved a motion that the Pader CAO be removed from office because he was incompetent and failed to implement council resolutions. Oringa, who led the group told the press that there were over 20 cases before the IGG that needed close follow-up. ""Our arrest is just a trick by government to intimidate all the 'whistle blowers' in Pader so that any corruption cases don't come out at all"", said a jovial handcuffed Oringa. Oringa said there were 31 council resolutions that the district through its CAO failed to implement over the years. His co-accused, Akena, said there were five government vehicles that belonged to Pader district local government that were to date locked up in Lira municipality because they have not yet been cleared from garages. He said the office of the CAO was also involved in deleting names of some civil servants from the government payroll without the concerned persons knowing it.

On Thursday, they asked the government to ensure that all those implicated in the mismanagement of development funds under the Office of Prime minister (OPM) are brought to justice. Eunice Musiime, the acting executive director Uganda National NGO Forum, told journalists that although a handful of individuals implicated in the scam are facing justice, the majority of those named seemed not to be facing the law. This was during a meeting held at the Forum's offices in Muyenga, Kampala. The meeting was called to raise awareness on the Peace Recovery and Development Monitoring Committee meeting that will be held soon to take stock of the Peace, Recovery and Development Plan. ""We reiterate the need to bring to book all the actors that were involved in the OPM scandal and other graft cases. ""We also implore our development partners to consider other alternative financing options based on the strengths of each mechanism,"" Musiime stressed. In the wake of the OPM scandal, key donor nations like Germany, Norway and Ireland withdrew aid from the east African nation. The UK and Denmark also suspended their financial assistance to Uganda then. During the reading of the 2013/2014 budget earlier this June, it was announced that Uganda would finance 80% of this budget. Fr. Dr. Silvester Arinaitwe Rwomukubwe, who is the executive secretary of Uganda Joint Christian Council, called on government to give hope to the people of northern Uganda who have suffered from the effects of the [Kony]war that took place in that region. ""It has been discouraging to note that the funds given to help the people who are suffering in the north are stolen by people in high offices. ""Government should make sure the stolen money is returned and government should deliver services to people,"" Rwomukubwe voiced his appeal. Thousands of people were displaced in northern Uganda when the country's army fought the Joseph Kony-led Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). While many were taken captive and consequently introduced into the rebel group, others were ruthlessly killed. Kony is now wanted by the Hague-based International Criminal Court (ICC) for atrocities his group committed in northern Uganda. Since the government drew out a resettlement plan after forcing the LRA out of the country, many people have returned to their communities. Gulu LCV chairman Martin Ojara said the cutting of donor aid to northern Uganda had affected many development programs. He said similar budget cuts to local governments in the north have negatively impacted on the delivery of services. After nearly twenty years of continuous conflict in that part of the country, the government formulated a comprehensive development framework - the Peace, Recovery and Development Plan (PRDP) - the initiation of which was launched by President YoweriMuseveni in 2007. This strategy is not only a response to immediate post-conflict-specific issues, but is purposely to eliminate the great discrepancies in the development of northern Uganda."325,The Sun (Nigeria),11/6/2012,Ribadu's report tests Jonathan's true mettle on corruption,,NIGERIA (94%),1228,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,3-Apr-13,"ABUJA, NIGERIA (79%)",1362 words,ENERGY & UTILITY REGULATION & POLICY (90%); OIL & GAS INDUSTRY (89%); CORRUPTION (87%); APPOINTMENTS (75%); PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (71%),"BY DAN ONWUKWE There is no shortage of shocking news in Nigeria. Virtually every day, we see a momentum of classic drama especially of the absurd. The way it unravels every so often, it seems we tolerate drama so well. And government, one is sometimes inclined to believe, is the unseen orchestra behind the drama we are watching. Few things will beat the ugly drama we witnessed last Friday at the official presentation of the report of the Petroleum Revenue Special Task Force headed by Mallam Nuhu Ribadu. The drama which played out before our very eyes at the Council Chambers of the Presidential Villa, Abuja, venue of the event, began when two members of the committee-Mr Stephen Oronsaye and Mr Ben Oti-openly disagreed about the process that produced the report. Even if President Jonathan was ""tipped off"" thatŒæa ""strange"" thing would happen that blustery day, I believe it surpassed what he anticipated. For a president who already has his fingernails bitten to his skin by the myriad of problems that questions his leadership ability to govern, the Ribadu report is the ultimate test of his true mettle on corruption, especially in the oil sector. Talk is always cheap, but success can only be achieved when genuine effort is put towards getting the purpose of every policy pronouncement done. The president has made promise upon promise to tackle corruption, including the oil sector. The question is: Is he waffling or playing to the gallery? Even if weŒægive the PresidentŒæbenefit of theŒæ doubt, that he means what he says, and he chose the former EFCC boss to head the task force because be believed in him. For whatever his failings may be, Ribadu remains one of the very few Nigerians who do not live in ideological bubble. Ribadu is a hot-headed guy, no doubt, just as hard as nail. He isŒæworking with the zeal of a zealot. Those who have worked closely with him say he has no record of compromise. According to them, Ribadu's idea of a meeting of minds is sticking to his guns and persuading colleagues that he was right. The disgraceful drama displayed by Oronsaye and Oti, when they alleged that the process that produced the final report was ""flawed"", for me, justifies whatever reasons behind leaking the report Reuters, an international news agency. Ribadu authenticated after the submission of the 146-page report that it was the same that Reuters has in its possession. I suspect that Ribadu and other members of the committee had a hunch that Oronsaye and Oti could play ""Judas Iscariot"" and wouldnt mind to fight at a public square in order to discredit the report. The stakes are high. Both men have recently been appointed into government boards. The case of Oronsaye is even more interesting. Until last year, he was the Head of Service of the Federation. He is used to leading and not a good follower. He headed the panel on the restructuring of government ministries and parastatals. Only recently, he was appointed into the board of the most enticing and corrupt- infested corporations in Nigeria, NNPC. In short, Oronsaye is used to be a ""government pikin"", an euphemism for spoilt adult who's used to privileges, catered for at public expense. It therefore would have been a huge surprise seeing these dissenters, Oronsaye and Oti, putting their signature on a report that raked up a lot of sleaze in NNPC and some multinational oil firms. The duo couldnt also agreed to be part of a committee that discovered thatŒæ ""discretionary"" oil licences were handed out by Mrs Diezani-Alison Madueke, minister of petroleum resources. A hefty $183m(about N28.73 bn) in signature bonuses are said to be missing from the deals. Although Diezani flatly denied sheŒægave out such licences, she however acknwoledged that the President has such ""discretionary"" powers to hand out oil licences to whomsoever he pleases. You can see the dilemma of Oronsaye and Oti and why they chose to be the ""flies in the oitment"" of the report. It is too easy to ignore Diezani's claim that she did not interfere in the work of the committee. But, why was she holding on to the report one clear month before the leakage compelled her to speak up? Were Oronsaye (who was said to have attended only few of the committee's sitting) and Oti, doing the bidding ofŒæ government orŒæ ""spying"" on the contents of the report so that they can make mountain out of mole-hill out the report?Œæ These are questions that dont lend themselves to easy answers. Again, lets believe the President is neutral in all of this, it is in the best interest of Oronsaye and Oti, to take the advice of the president and write their own reports if they strongly disagree with the process. But theŒægreater interest is with the President who set up the committee. It is in his best interest, though not a must to implement the recommendations of the committee. A presidency is often defined by what a president chooses to be his agenda.Jonathan claims his presidency is a ""transformational"" one, and tackling corruptional a major plank of this agenda. In politics, some issues blaze with opportunities to ascertain such claims or for the citizens toŒæ take them as cheap talk. That's why leadership matters. Nigerians are asking: Does the president have the courage to do what he says he will do? Ribadu's report presents him with that rare chance to change that public perceptionŒæ or write him off as a wimp. Œæ This is the time for the President to prove that probes are not forŒæ entertainment, but real efforts to get things done for the country. There's no doubt that the affairs of the oil industry in the last decade at least( 2002 - 2012), a period which the Ribadu committee covered, represents an era of anything goes in the oil sector. Only Nigeria and republic of Congo are such abuses and revolving doors of corruption seen anywhere in the world. That much was said in the report. As we all know by now, the report reveals, among other things, that between 2002 and 2012, Nigeria lost tons of billions of dollars in oil and gas revenues from cut-price deals allegedly struck between three major oil companies - Shell, Total and Eni. Such bumper profits from such cut-price crude oil and gas deals, the report remarked, may not be ""illegal"", but they did not follow best standards of using open bids. Government is estimated to have lost $29 billion from such cut-price deals. Such discretionary favours undermine the tenets of transparency and accountability since international oil traders whoŒæwere not on the ""approved master list of customers had been sold crude oil without any formal contracts"". such contracts. Overall, the report made far-reaching recommendations to sanitise the oil sector, one of them, an independent review of the use of international oil traders. This is the practice in many oil producing nations. For years now, the NNPC has been at the centre of many scandals . Not long ago, the Nigeria Extractive Industries Initiative (NEITI) has reported that the corporation lacked due process, while individuals there have helped themselves at the detriment of national interest. Public expectation high on what the President would do with theŒæ report. ŒæŒæ Œæ Œæ Today in America Global Cable News Network(CNN), has in the hectic period of presidential campaigns, reminded the world that ""American elections are for Americans but its impact is on all of us"". True. And today, American citizens go to the poll, it is either to re- elect President Barack Obama of the Democratic Party for a second term, or his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney. It has been an intense campaign like no other in their history, with an estimated $3 billion spent. It comes down to the choice of the people. Pundits are predicting perhaps one of the closest contests in years, with Obama tipped to get the required 270 Electoral College votes to remain in the White House. In all, America continues to teach the world that democracy is about people and issues that affect them. That's why the impact of what happens in USA will continue to affect us.

The group, under the leadership of a lawyer and fiery preacher, Pastor Tunde Bakare is no doubt known for its penchant for civil protests anytime its members feel that democracy is being threatened. In January 2010, when the Nigeria Constitution was not being followed to the letter during the sickness of the former President, Umaru Yar'Adua, the group mobilized to ""occupy Abuja."" The group was also the backbone of the mother of all protests held in January this year when the administration of Goodluck Jonathan gave the country a new year gift of increase in the prices of oil products. The whole country was literally ""occupied"" by members of the civil society that was mobilized by the SNG until the government shifted its stance from N140 per litre to N97 per litre. Presently, the group is spoiling for another big battle with the leadership of the country, this time, on corruption. And if the threat of the group last Monday is carried out, Nigeria is in for another round of ""operation occupy Nigeria."" RAZAQ BAMIDELE, who witnessed the occasion where the fresh threat was issued, reports. State of the nation Since the formation of the SNG, the Convener, Pastor Tunde Bakare and his members had made it abundantly clear that the group is out to cleanse the society and purge it of all anti-people policies and anti-democracy tendencies. They have vowed that nothing can stop them from rising against any form of oppression and injustices in the polity. It is against this backdrop that the group has taken it upon itself to organize series of seminars, symposium, workshops and annual lecture series to enlighten, educate, sensitise and mobilize the populace to know their rights and demand for them. Annual lecture series So, early this year, the first lecture, delivered by the universally renowned scholar, Professor Niyi Osundare was organized. And not satisfied with the state of the nation, the group came up with the second in the lecture series. An Associate Professor from Department of English and Literature, Cerleton University, Canada, Pius Adesanmi delivered the lecture titled: Reparations: What Nigeria owes the tortoise. In the lecture, the don identified greed, selfishness as well as excessive corruption on the part of the country's leadership as the cause of her backwardness, asserting that ""until the nation is purged of all these societal ills, the country will continue to move from bad to worse."" While likening Nigeria's rulers to the proverbial tortoise in the ancient fables, the lecturer narrated a couple of fables where the tortoise was reported to have ruined itself through ""excessive consumption to the detriment of the collective goal of the people."" According to him, since the resources of the country were for the welfare of the generality of the citizenry, ""the covenant of greed, ala, the tortoise must be broken to give way to respect for collective goal and common will of the people,"" insisting that ""common will of the people is sacred."" Adesanmi, who wondered that the same oil discover in Dubai that has become a blessing to that country was the same oil that has been spelling doom for Nigeria was of the conviction that everything possible must be done to evolve a natural self fashioning for nationhood where common goal would be the pre-occupation of all and sundry. Waxing philosophical, the don warned that ""the country would not move an inch if her leadership keeps on plagiarizing the greedy way of the tortoise and work towards a collective will of the people."" He expressed sadness that ""the leadership of the country is, sadly, not even plagiarizing the tortoise but stealing, robbing and looting the tortoise intellectual property and thus owe the tortoise reparations."" He then challenged ""those of us who bear the brunt of the repercussions of our leaders' greed, corruption and selfishness to rise up against the ills,"" submitting that ""it is then that we will gradually find our way back to our common goal and collective will that will move the country forward."" Call for protests The lecturer's postulation gingered the former Minister of the Federal Capital territory (FCT), Nasir el-Rufai, to admit that the country was at a crossroads, warning that the situation would degenerate if the people did not rise up to tackle the misdeeds bedeviling the nation. El-Rufai noted that creating what he called ""Nigerian elite enclave mentality"" would not shield anyone from the impending crises if the people refused to act now. According to him, people below the age of 20 currently constitute the majority of the country's population, but they are faced with hardship and excruciating poverty. He bemoaned the decadence in the social structure, which he said had led to an unending cycle of violence and bloodletting, stressing that all these problems manifesting in form of violence and terrorist attacks, were products of corruption, lack of inadequate education, as well as the high unemployment rate in the country. So to him, people must rise up to stop corruption in the country. Toeing el-Rufai's line was the Lagos State governorship candidate of the Democratic Peoples Alliance (DPA), in the 2007 general election, Mr. Jimi Agbaje, who noted that the fight against corruption in the country could only succeed with the collective responsibility of both the leaders and the led. He called on Nigerians to resist corrupt leaders or they would be constantly pauperized by them. On her part, the President of Campaign for Democracy (CD), and leader of Women Arise, Dr. Joe Okei-Odumakin, said the idea of always wanting to share the ""national cake"" had remained an obstacle to the nation's development. She therefore urged the government to prosecute all the parties found culpable in the controversial oil subsidy scam. ""Gathering here is to prove a point that Nigeria belongs to all of us and we cannot fold hands and watch corruption tear us apart,"" she said. The Chairman of the Ikeja chapter of the Nigerian Bar Association, Monday Ubani, said the country had failed but still working for those responsible for it. He called for a synergy between the public and the press to chart a new course for the nation in the fight against corruption. A former member of the House of Representatives, Dino Melaye, asserted that the country's problem is mainly corruption, regretting that 60 per cent of the nation's budgetary allocation goes to mismanagement and corruption. He said the country was at the ""emergency ward"" and would go to the ""intensive care unit"" if the people did not act. In his closing remarks, the SNG Convener, Pastor Tunde Bakare lamented that the country is on the brink of collapse insisting that ""it requires the urgent intervention of all citizens, especially through protests, to rescue it."" Bakare therefore urged Nigerians to immediately take to the streets and bring an end to corruption and bad governance, which he said were seriously threatening the survival of the nation. Even religious leaders across Christianity and Islam were not spared as he alleged that some use their positions to enrich themselves, and maintain ostentatious lifestyles, including buying private jet just as he called on the people to begin to cleanse the corrupt system by moving against such clerics. His words: ""All G.O. (General Overseers) must go to prison...and all of us must be rounded up and put in jail. This is not the first time I am saying it. If the revolution does not begin in the church or mosque, Nigeria will not change. Dubai (United Arab Emirates) once came to Nigeria to borrow money. And what prevents transformation in Dubais from happening in Nigeria is the corruption of our leaders."" According to the preacher, the massive protests that greeted the removal of fuel subsidy by President Goodluck Jonathan in January demonstrated that the myth that Nigerians are a docile people, who lost the capacity to be shocked by the misdeeds of their rulers, has been shattered forever. Calling for protests to immediately begin, Bakare noted that almost everywhere in the world, democracy was preceded by revolution, and development, just as he agonized that, Nigeria had put the cart before the horse. If the clarion call for protests is heeded by the civil society, Nigerians, in no time will witness another mother of all protests against corruption and corrupt people in the country. And Bakare has assured that when it happens, it would shake the country to its very foundation."327,The Sun (Nigeria),1/19/2013,We are not fighting corruption-Izuogu,,NIGERIA (90%),1228,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,22-Jan-13,"ABUJA, NIGERIA (90%)",3502 words,GOVERNORS (90%); CORRUPTION (89%); POLITICAL PARTIES (78%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (78%); CIVIL WAR (71%); AIRCRAFT ACCIDENTS (68%); BOKO HARAM (65%),"From Iheanacho Nwosu,Abuja Three times governorship candidate in Imo State and People's Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain, Dr Ezekiel Izuogu is not happy with the way things are going in the country. Apart from the insecurity, which has reached an unacceptable height, the corruption in the system and the lip-service government is paying to the crusade against it is the main reason he is sad. He also shared his thoughts on a number of other issues, including the controversy surrounding the money released by Anambra State governor for Dr. Alex Ekwueme's 80th birthday celebrations. Excerpts: You have, in some fora, lamented some events of last year, are you by that, suggesting that the national leadership did not do much? No, no. I am not indicting anybody. There are many things to be thankful for. We should thank God that we are alive; we should thank God that our country remains one; we should thank God that we seem to have a sense of direction even though we appear to be slow. As I said, there are many things to thank God for. However, last year was very, very bloody; it was the bloodiest year we have witnessed since the history of this country, apart from the civil war. The activities of Boko Haram were scary and bloody. The insecurity in the country reached an alarming level last year. Our country is now classified as the sixth most dangerous in the world. And that is not a wonderful commendation. These are great challenges. But, despite these challenges we have reason to thank God. We have remained a nation under God in spite of these incredible challenges. Look at the air crash involving the governor of Kaduna, that was very scary. My heart goes out to the widow of Yakowa and to the people of the state. The crash raised the level of insecurity to another level, a short shuttling that was less than 20 minutes in a chopper could claim the lives of those on board including a governor. Am happy that people are speaking on the need for a thorough probe into the incident. There is need for such probe so as to know if the crash was as a result of technical fault or sabotage. Everything does appear that nobody is safe anymore; you are not safe walking on the road, flying in the air or on water. I do hope that the Federal Government would look with seriousness the concerns of average Nigerians as far as security is concerned. Are you not contradicting yourself when you said that insecurity has reached an alarming proportion and yet you said that there is a direction in the country? I said that we have reasons to thank God for the nation because we have remained one despite the challenges we have had, there is nothing contradictory about that. The situation has been bad but we have managed to move along. I also think that the government is doing its best. I do not see what the President could have done to stop the Boko Haram insurgency other than to look for a negotiated settlement. And the government has made it clear, a number of times, that it is willing to negotiate with the sect. I support negotiation with the sect. Are you saying those who accuse the President of having not done much to address the worsening insecurity are not fair to him? Certainly, government must share some blame in what is happening because the issue of security belongs squarely to its court. Government at the federal, state and local government level has a duty to provide security for the populace. Certainly, more could be done by the government. Some are of the view that the President has not done much to deserve his loyalists campaigning for his re-election in 2015. What's your take? I don't share the view because in a democracy, people can campaign, it is allowed. If somebody chooses to campaign from now to 2015, he is not breaking any law. So, those who want to campaign for his re-election can do so. But what is there is that, in a democracy, the people would have to take a decision at the appropriate time. That is why democracy provides for an election.Œæ In 2015, our people will decide if the incumbent has done well or not. If he has done well, they will vote for him, if not they will vote him out. But so far, would you say the President is on track and deserves a re-election? It is not for that yet; election is not close by. When we get to the bridge, we will cross it. Certainly, I will take a decision as a Nigerian citizen on who to support at the appropriate time. I'm not going to be shy about that. You have been moving round, campaigning that the South East should produce the next president. Is that not an indirect statement that the president has no chance the next time? No, you are wrong there. Advocating a South Eastern presidency does not equate to a vote of no confidence in anybody. We are talking about equity. In a democracy like that of Nigeria, you have to have justice and equity in order to stabilize the system. That is the position of South East Forum, which I am the chairman of. We are saying that, of all the six geo-political zones, it is only the South East that has not produced the President. We are saying that the South East deserves to have a short at the presidency. However, nothing stops Jonathan from running, under a democracy. But even if he is running, that is not enough to stop somebody from South East from running for the office; it will not stop a northerner from running. The annoying thing is that some of our brothers are saying that no one from the South East should even think about it, until Jonathan finishes, whenever he finishes. I do not share that view. I share the view that, yes, an incumbent has a right to aspire for a second term and it is left to the people to judge whether he deserves a second term or not. That does not stop anybody from running. You cannot make a law that nobody should run until A or B has finished. Obama was adjudged doing well in his first term but he had challengers. The Republican Party produced Mitt Rommney and he ran a very good race that he nearly won the election. There is no monopoly in election. You supported Jonathan 100 per cent in 2011. I supported Jonathan and went round with his campaign train. Initially, I looked at the zoning system of the PDP and I said, if we were to go by the zoning agreement, it favoured the North. But Jonathan, through circumstantial providence, became acting President. When President Yar'Adua died, he became President. So, he was an incumbent and he had only done one year before the 2011 election. The South South had not produced a President before then, he was the first South Southern person to be president and that was why my sentiment went for him. My position was that, since he was there for only a year, he needed to be given a chance to do another four years. That has happened. So, the situation in 2011 will not the same in 2015. I am a man of equity and justice. I supported MKO Abiola because I believed then that power should shift from the North to South. I went round the country with Abiola. Even when some Igbo were opposing him, I was mobilizing support for him; I got Igbo leaders to support him. I was doing that because I believe in equity. If the South South had not produced a president, I would throw my weight behind the zone to produce the next president. I cannot be against my people, if I advocate justice for other people, would I not also do same for my own people? Dokubo recently claimed that the President has disappointed the South South and South East that were his stronghold in 2011. Do you share his sentiment? No. I am a fair-minded person, I won't dismiss Jonathan just yet; he still has two and a half years to go. Even if he is not doing extremely well now, he has a chance of improving on his performance. If you ask me this question in 2014, I will give you a better answer. I am a scientist, I look at empirical evidence; I look at things before I pass a judgment. I won't judge Jonathan just yet. I think it is too early to do so. There are insinuations that you are at war with some Igbo leaders over your campaign for South East to field presidential candidate in 2015, how true is that? It is true, but the development is not discouraging to me. It is not because we are in a democracy, everybody is not bound to share my views, people are entitled to their different opinions. There are some people who are saying look, nobody should talk about presidency from the South East until Jonathan finishes. They are saying that to make Jonathan happy and get closer to him. I don't have any problem with that; they are free to do that. The President knows me very well; he knows that I am a frank person. My position is that, yes, if he performs well, he can contest. Even if he doesn't do well, he can still contest and the people would be left to judge. But that does not stop a South Easterner from contesting, that does not stop a northerner from contesting, we are in a democracy and everybody is free to aspire to any office. Our democracy is not supposed to be less democratic than that of America; it is not supposed to be guided. No matter how good an incumbent may be, there are still challengers. The incumbent may win with a landslide, which is to say that voters are happy with him or her. But because it is a democracy, there would be challengers. If there are no challengers, then it is a dictatorship. Have you lost some politician friends from the South East because of your position that someone from the zone should challenge Jonathan in 2015? Our democracy is a bit on the primitive side; it is like only sycophants are recoganised. Even when you give a constructive advice or criticism, they tag you as opposition. Nobody listens to constructive criticisms. This has made intelligent people to keep quiet because they do not want to be classified as enemies. Look at the case of US, during the election, Obama was openly attacking his opponent, calling him by name and Rommney openly attacked Obama, calling him by name. But the two focused on issues, their campaigns were issues-oriented. In Nigeria, when you try to correct somebody who is power, they will brand you an enemy. At my age, I don't think that should bother me. I believe that somebody must say the truth at some point. If we don't say the truth now, are we going to say it in our grave? I will not be against somebody dogmatically, but I will creativelyŒæ assess issues. When Abiola came, some people in Igboland said no, no they will not support a Yoruba man, I asked them why. Even if you had some quarrel with some Yoruba people in the past, it is wrong for you to generalize that all Yoruba are bad. I maintained the same posture in our meetings with them. I will not support every Igbo to be President, there are some I will never support because they will go there and mess everybody up. I won't support those who are very corrupt and incompetent. Igbo would be worse off if you put a corrupt Igbo there. He will embarrass everybody with his thievery and that will give bad name to Ndigbo. When we talk about equity and justice in the sharing of power, we are not sacrificing competence, only the competent can lead this country. You have been involved in media war with some prominent South East politicians over the handling of monies realised for the Dr Alex Ekwueme birthday celebrations recently, what really happened? My dear brother, that thing is very, very embarrassing, I feel ashamed talking about it because these were people I trusted and held in high esteem. I have not recovered from the shock of what happened. About three years ago the South East Forum (SEF) leaders decided to celebrate Ekwueme, their leader. This was more or less to show him appreciation for what he had done for the forum over the years. So, we said, ok, in three years the man would turn 80, it is a milestone, we have to celebrate him. I approached Ekwueme and told him, please we want to celebrate your birthday. I told him that SEF will organise a dinner for him at Transcorp Hilton, Abuja. He gave approval to that and we agreed that the highpoint of the celebrations would be bringing together all his friends to Transcorp to say good things about him. We knew that there would be other celebrations across the country for him. Federal Polytechnic, Oko, for instance, always does such for him. We focused on the dinner for political leaders. Three months to the time, we approached him again and he still gave his approval. Then we constituted the planning committee; we selected Senator Nnamani as Chairman, Okwesilieze Nwodo was like the alternate chairman... Is Nnamani a member of the forum? Yes. We gave terms of reference at the inauguration, which took place at Chelsea Hotel. We agreed the highpoint of the celebration would be dinner at Transcorp Hotel and a novelty football match. Nnamani accepted to work along those lines. Thereafter, they decided to see the governor of Anambra State, Mr. Peter Obi, who doubles as the Chairman of South East Governors' Forum. There was nothing wrong with that. They briefed Obi and he was very happy and promised that they were going to throw their weight behind the arrangement. He asked that some of the celebrations be brought to Enugu. He asked them to come up with a budget. The committee went and raised a budget of N82 million, they sent a copy to me. I said ok, if the governor is going to bring such money, then we have to open an account for it. The account was eventually opened in Damond Bank. The signatories to the account were the chairman of the forum, chairman of the planning committee, which was Nnamani and Nwodo, the secretary. The governor was duly informed. The opening of the account was where the problem started. Some members of the committee felt that this money going into an account where Izuogu is a signatory will not be too good for them. They felt that they would not have free hand, that Izuogu talks about accountability all the time and he will make things difficult for everybody. An attempt was made to remove me so that I will not be a signatory to the account but the move failed. They now changed strategy and wanted the money given to them directly without passing through the account. They succeeded in getting the money directly. But to my greatest surprise, they refused to release N5 million that was charged by Transcorp Hotel for the dinner. Three days to the dinner, I called former President Shagari and requested him to chair the dinner, he accepted even without getting a letter from me. Shagari was already on his way coming from Sokoto but the Nnamani committee refused to release the money for the dinner. What was the reason they gave for not releasing the money? No reason was given to me. The dinner nearly failed, I had to look for money and paid - that was two days to the event. That was how the dinner held. Now, the only activity that the committee did was the one-day cultural display in Enugu. I was reliably informed that not more than N8m was used for that. But N28m was released to them for that. We said if N28m was released, part of that should fund the dinner, which is only N5m. It was generally reported that the money was shared among themselves. I am not believing rumours and that is why I said that the committee has to give an account. Have you reached Nnamani since then? Oh yes, several efforts. In fact, SEF wrote him a letter because all the committees that worked for the birthday, as far as SEF is concerned, rendered account. Two days after the dinner, we rendered an account of the dinner - how it was organised, how the money was raised and how much was spent. We sent the account to all the leaders of SEF, including Nnamani. It is a normal thing that after an activity, there is an account of how much money was raised and how the money was spent. We are not accusing anybody, everybody in the committee is my personal friend - my brothers - but we are saying that leaders must show example. I believe that leaders in this country must be accountable. They accuse you of deliberately trying to smear their reputation, how do you defend that? That is why I am giving this clarification. Why should I smear anybody's name; what will I gain from that? Look at my background in Imo State; all my political opponents know that I don't smear anybody's name. There are enough issues to hold in your campaign, I don't descend to the level of wanting to smear anybody's name. I don't stand to gain anything by doing that. If somebody says you should give him an account of an activity of N28m of public fund, is that smear? The simple thing is to render the account to show that you are clean. I am the Chairman of SEF, the buck stops on my table, so I have every reason to demand the rendering of the account. Every member of the forum is crying foul, you need to listen to what they are saying about the whole thing. They are giving impression that because it involved big men, that is why they cannot be called to render account. They are saying, because this has to do with former Senate President, former governor and National Chairman of PDP they can do anything and get away with it. Our constitution prescribes suspension of anybody that does anything that contravenes the rules of the association. Have they been suspended? No, we are still waiting for the accounts. Is the celebrant aware of all these allegations and counter allegations? Yes, he is aware. We never wanted to bother him with any of these things but he got to know later. When you are celebrating somebody's birthday, you want to keep him out of the arrangements; you want it to be a surprise package for him. So, as much as possible, we tried to keep these things away from Ekwueme. If these people had rendered an account, nobody would have heard about it. But a situation where a committee you set up would collect the money that was given on the platform of the forum and then refused to fund a legitimate item of the birthday is unacceptable. The dinner was approved by the national planning committee of Ekwueme birthday headed by Bamanga Tukur. I have the programme and it had Ekwueme's approval. The dinner was not for Ezekiel Izuogu; it was for the celebrant. If that is the case, why would they hold N28 million and refuse to bring out less than N5m to fund the dinner? Do you align with those who accuse President Jonathan of having not shown enough courage to fight corruption? I share that view, I believe that the government can do more to control corruption. I sincerely believe that the government of Nigeria, not just Jonathan's government, those that preceded Jonathan's own paid lip-service to anti-corruption crusade. Corruption is romanced in this country. Government may condemn it publicly, but down the line, you see corruption in almost everything we do. The culture of impunity appears to have eaten into our system and that is why people can go and handle big sums of money and they would feel that they are not accountable to anybody. It is a culture that is developing and it is very, very unfortunate. The young people are looking at the leaders. They are now copying the so-called leaders and are now going into kidnapping, armed robbery, etc. I am not condoning any of those vices because there is no justifiable reason for going into kidnapping or armed robbery but the truth is that the young people are looking at we elders. If they cannot find good behaviours from us, they take to anything. We have a situation today, where anybody who grabs money is celebrated; he is given a national award, he becomes an important person. Nobody cares to know how he made his money. That is the greatest problem we have in this country. You are now using bad examples as more or less what people should emulate. Every young person now wants to be a multi-millionaire. He knows that there are some multi-billionaires who never worked, who only engaged in one or two frauds before hitting it. In Imo State where you hail from, kidnapping is clearly an issue. Would you attribute the crime to a failure of governance in the state? It is not just in the state but generally there is failure of governance. The leaders have been showing bad examples. It is a cumulative effect of rigging elections, where young people are watching somebody who did not win but because he did some manipulations, is announced as winner and everybody is falling on the ground shouting ""Your Excellency, Your Excellency."" It is a bad example that people are borrowing. You find people who clearly had no means of livelihood but have wangled their way to wealth, they become exceedingly rich. The young people are looking at these things and at some point, they reach a conclusion that, look, the rules don't really matter. If you obey the rules you lose out, you become a mugu. Those who are keeping to the rules become mugus; those who are wangling their way become the guys. What is happening is a cumulative effect of evils. The evils are leading to more evils. I warned our people in Imo State ten years ago about what is happening now."328,The Sun (Nigeria),3/7/2013,"Nigeria needs a radical leader to fight corruption -Abonta, Rep.",,NIGERIA (96%),1228,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,7-Mar-13,,1817 words,LEGISLATIVE BODIES (91%); LEGISLATION (90%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (89%); REAL PROPERTY LAW (77%); CORRUPTION (76%); HISTORY (69%),"By Iheanacho Nwosu Uzoma Abonta , a former don, is a member of the House of Representatives from Abia State. He is the Deputy Chairman , House Committee on Privatisation and Commercialisation . The lawmaker stands out as the sponsor of the highest bills on the floor of the House. In this interview he shared his thoughts on a number of issues including governance , corruption and his mission in the House. On his Bills: Most of my bills have been passed by the House and sent to the Senate for concurrence. You know how slow lawmaking is - first, second reading, committee stage and then to the whole house before passage. It takes an average of two years to have a bill turned into an Act but we will not relent in our efforts to make laws forŒæ good governance of the country. My interest has been on alternative source of revenue outside oil. So my bills revolve around agriculture and theŒæ capital market. Quite a number of my bills have been concluded in the House and sent to the Senate for concurrence butŒæ I am aware that none has been sent to the President for assent. Constitution Review: The problems confronting the constitution review is the usual legislative problems. The constitution is made in such a way that it is very rigid and difficult to amend. With the way we are going, I will give the National Assembly credit for what has been done so far. But I also have my fears being a Nigerian, Œæ a constitutional lawyer, being a student of political history and given the way Nigeria is structured. If you follow the history of Nigeria and all our efforts at constitution making,you will see that it is going to be a herculian task. We have 36 states and we have diverse interests. You know the composition of the National Assembly as well as I do and how someŒæ people view issues from sectional perspectives rather than nationalŒæ interests. Therefore do not expect that the ongoing amendment will be easy. In the last dispensation, National Assembly in its wisdom, granted financial autonomy to the State Houses of Assembly but the same legislators in the states voted against it. Now we are talking about granting a similar autonomy to the local government councils. In the course of the public sessions, most of the local governments voted for this autonomy but today the argument seems not to be in favour of that decision. The issue is that the powers that be seem to be working against that proposal.The postponement of the public presentation of the report of our nationwideŒæ public sessions is not aŒæ problem because the position of the 360 constituencies were taken publicly and therefore already public documents. The major challenge will come when anŒæ issue such as the Land Use Act will come up. You know some people might not want it removed from the constitution. If it comes to a matter of voting, you know the composition of the House. Numerically, Œæ Kano, Kebbi and Jigawa are bigger than the five states of the South East geopolitical zone. So if some people do not want certain amendments and it is one man one vote, there is no way it can go. However, I do not want to be a prophet of doom. I have hope that we will get there. If we do not succeed in amending all the sections we want to now, there will at least be substantial amendment. We should not lose hope.In amending the constitution, we must create awareness about the issues at stake. ŒæWe must also have the political will to go all out because it is going to hurt the powers that be in the system. It is not easy to retrieve from the mighty. It must be something that must be contested vehemently.The task of constitutional amendment is not just for the legislators; the media and the civil society groups must play their own roles of sensitising and mobilising the people. Local Government Autonomy I will give you the answer from two perspectives - as a Nigerian and a oneŒæ who has been a councillor. In 1991, I was a councillor and leader of the Legislative Council in Ukwa-East Local Government Area of Abia State.If you don't grant autonomy to local government councils, they will still remain an appendage of the state governors. Today, a local government chairman does not have a say in what goes on at the council. Although he is the head of the third tier of government he cannot say no to the governor of the state. In 1991-1993 when we were there, the situation was better than it is today. I cannot hold the chairman of my local government accountable now because he is only there at the mercy of the state governor.Until the two tiers are separated and each is given specific roles the problem will remain. Most importantly, there should be financial autonomy for the local government councils and that means the State/Local Government Joint Account should be abolished. Let this account be separated so that councils can get their funds directly andŒæ be free to pursue development according to the needs of their people and no according to the dictates of the state governors. The councillors should be able to vet the budget of the councils just like the National Assembly does to the federal budget. Today, a lot of things happening at the local government level come from the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, an appointee of the state governor.This is why the governors wouldn't want to let go until Nigerians put up aŒæ fight. As a lawyer, I also know that if you give the councils fullŒæ autonomy without checks, we will also whittle down the essence of federalism. True federalism recognises two components - the centre and the component states. It does not recognise the local government as a tier. Therefore in giving autonomy to the local government, we must be very careful and define the extent of the autonomy. It is desirable and proper to grant them autonomy because it will foster development and stabilise our democracy. Capital Market The issue of the capital market has remained very topical. During the controversy, the leadership of theŒæ House in their wisdom asked the Capital Market Committee to step aside for an interim committee to investigate the collapse of the capital market. This wasŒæ to allow fair hearing on the issues. The Adhoc Committee concluded the investigation and also laid the report before the House.The capital market and its institutions areŒæ still functioning, but because of the prolonged problem between the House, Arunma Oteh and the Presidency, we declared the DG persona non grata.We still do our oversight over the capital market institutions but the House said we will have nothing to do with SEC as long as Oteh remains there. The House has forwarded its resolution to President for implementation. Though he is yet to take action, I assure you that the House will not toy with the capital market because it is also one of the indices to monitorŒæ our economy. It is one way to attract investors and grow our economy.It is not in our interest as a country to allow the capital market crash. Right now we are talking with the Abuja Commodity ExchangeŒæ Market which is one of the institutions in the sector. They have some challenges and we are trying to see how we can fix the problems. Corruption I make bold to say that corruption is the problem of Nigeria. Peter Tosh once said that everybody is talking about the criminal; who then is the criminal? Nigeria is a very corrupt society and we are not fighting corruption. We are romancing with corruption; we are sleeping with corruption; we are doing our valentine with corruption and do everything with corruption. Corruption is fastŒæ becomingŒæ a norm in Nigeria.President Goodluck Jonathan must sit up and fight corruption; the war must start from the Villa. We need a very radical leader who will fight corruption.The AsianŒæ countries of China, Singapore, Malaysia and indonesia were more corrupt than Nigeria until one day whenŒæ their leaders rose to the challenge and introduced capital punishment as penalty for corruption. As soon as the law came into force anyone caught stealing public funds or engaging in any form of corruption was either hanged of shot dead. Today we talk about the Asian Tigers because their leaders decided to have zero tolerance for corruption. But here,Œæ our laws are loose and some of us would not mind going to jail and come back to inherit N10billion. We know that you can even steal billions and just pay a paltry fine and go home to enjoy your loot.I make bold to say that civil servants are the worst problemŒæ of Nigeria. I call them ""evil servants"" because they are not civil in any way. Once you are appointed a minister, they send you one big memo; they tell you how you can buy a house where you will live. Once you sign that memo you are finished.Look at our annual budgets; the amount of money spent in the month of December is greater that allŒæ the money spent in the remaining part of the year. Why is it that under personal and overhead costs all the funds must be finished at the end of the year? They told us they discovered 45,000 ghost workersŒæ in the civil service. How many are the civil servants if 45,000 are ghosts? In all these, no one has been punished and we have directors and permanent secretaries in those ministries.I think that something drastic has to be done. Corruption has become endemic here and itŒæ is not found only among civil servants. Even other members of the society like market womenŒæ are involved. Go to the market toŒæ buy garri and they will sell to you with falsified measurements. It is corruption at that level. It is not only among people in government that you find corruption. We have had several investigations but nobody has been jailed. It is so bad that people now think that the best way to be rich and popular is to engage in corruption. When you are arrested and taken to court, you enjoy free publicity and after that nothing happens and you go home and enjoy your loot. The few thatŒæ even even went to jail came back and are now eminent persons deciding the fate of Nigerians instead of burying their heads in shame.In other countries they would have been hang for their crimes. I am not saying that we must apply capital punishment but we must try to do something that will show that we have zero tolerance to corruption. We need ethical revolution. Starting from the market women, school children, civil servants and even to the politicians.The greatest number of empty house in Abuja is in Asokoro and Maitama districts. Nobody is occupying them because they are not affordableŒæ and their owners are not bothered about it. Who owns them? Civil servants. If they pay you your salary twenty years up front you cannot afford those houses. So how were these civil servants able to acquire them?ŒæThis is why mass housing or low cost housing schemes have not worked. When government designs low cost housing projects, the high cost people will acquire them all and then rent them to the low cost people."329,The Sun (Nigeria),3/9/2013,Nigeria must fight corruption to avoid Arab spring -Jerry Rawlings,,NIGERIA (94%); GHANA (93%); AFRICA (93%); EGYPT (92%),1228,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,9-Mar-13,,516 words,CORRUPTION (93%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (85%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (78%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (78%); RULE OF LAW (77%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (76%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (71%); ROAD & BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION (61%); CONTRACT AWARDS (60%); CONSTRUCTION (50%); HIGHWAYS & STREETS (50%),"From Geoffrey Anyanwu, Awka Former President of Ghana, Jerry Rawlings yesterday in Awka called on African countries especially Nigeria to face headon now the fight against corruption in government or risk a sudden eruption as occurred in Egypt and Tunisia. Rawlings, who gave a keynote address at the 2nd Zik Lecture Series of the Faculty of Social Sciences, Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka on the theme; ""Eradicating Corruption in Africa"", stated that though it would be a big battle, it was not one that could not be fought, warning that its postponement would spell doom for the country and the continent. According to him, ""corruption arises from a state of deviation from the moral or spiritual norm; it is a deliberate refusal to operate based on set rules, regulations and laws and with a wicked, if not evil desires to circumvent the punitive actions that come with such deliberate action. Corruption manifests itself in many ways."" At the lecture, which was attended by prominent personalities, including the Special Adviser to the President on Inter Party Affairs, Senator Ben Obi, who was the chairman of the occasion, Senator. Chris Ngige, Gov. Peter Obi, Senior Special Assistant to the President, Chief Akachukwu Nwakpu, former ASUU President, Prof. Asisi Asobie, who was the guest lecturer and traditional rulers, Rawlings said he sees corruption more in terms of moral degradation and a greedy quest to outdo each other in terms of class, distinction and perceived respect in society. He further said: ""It is the willingness to tolerate the intolerable that gives the motivation or momentum for persons or institutions with influence to perpetrate acts of corruption within our society. Corruption at the level of government directly affects the rule of law and debases the moral right of political leadership to serve as a respected regulator of the affairs of the state. ""Corruption in our society is most prevalent whenever the private sector meets government over transactions of state - construction of roads, procurement of goods, equipment and services and provision of various forms of services for the state. As desirable as they may be, development projects and especially the huge modernisation projects, lend themselves to this form of corruption. ""It is not uncommon for state institutions and personalities such as ministers and various departments to award contracts not to the lowest bidder or the best-value-for-money bidder but to the one who effectively offers the highest bribe."" ŒæThe former Ghanaian leader, therefore, said that leadership by example meant that a leader whether at national or local level, must not merely talk about truth, integrity and accountability but must demonstrate those qualities in their daily lives. Further advising the leaders he said: ""Leaders must understand that when you take away the power of the people to express moral outrage, you have effectively disempowered your capacity to fight corruption through the people. Let us have faith in our people and respect them. We have statesmen and women of integrity on our continent."""330,The Sun (Nigeria),3/26/2013,"Check corruption, focus on reforms",,NIGERIA (90%),1228,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,26-Mar-13,"ABUJA, NIGERIA (90%)",710 words,EXECUTIVE MOVES (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); CIVIL SERVICES (89%),"...My immediate priority, by Goni From JULIANA TAIWO-OBALONYE, Abuja From the President yesterday came a directive to the new Head of Civil Service of the Federation (HOSF), Bukar Goni Aji: continue with reforms embarked by your predecessors, check corruption and revamp the Federal Civil Service, ensuring it is returned to its glorious days. President Goodluck Jonathan gave the charge at the swearing-in of Goni, witnessed by Vice President Namadi Sambo, Governor of Yobe State Ibrahim Gaidam, Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Sen. Anyim Pius Anyim, ministers, presidential aides, Goni's predecessors, Alhaji Isa Bello Sali, former Head of Service, Amb. Abu Obe, Ebele Okeke (first female Head of Service), Steve Oronsaye and Prof. Oladapo Afolabi. While commending Goni for coming well-prepared both academically and professional experience, the President said the change of leadership of the service came when his administration was not just taking stock of what have been accomplished so far in meeting the desires and aspirations of the people, but also accelerating action and increasing articulation of those things still outstanding in national development. Jonathan, who commended Sali, who he said served the nation well and retired meritoriously, charged the new HOSF to build on what his predecessors have done and focus on areas that would bring accelerated impact on the lives of Nigerians. ""The civil service which you now head is very central to the realization of our Transformation Agenda as a people and the associated hopes and aspirations of our citizens. ""I will want to especially draw your attention to the ongoing reforms aimed at our nation's rapid economic development. ""As you set about your duties, the expectation of the government and our people is that you will now build on the achievements of your predecessors so as to complete on-going reforms. In particular, you must focus on those sectors that will help the administration to deliver with urgency, beliefs and benefits which are the core of our survival as a people. Such as agriculture, infrastructure, education, health, among others. ""You must also pursue with vigour the true implementation of the performance management system in the civil service, I believe its full implementation will positively improve the ability of civil servants to discharge their responsibilities. I also expect that you will intensify your efforts to enhance discipline and curtail corruption in the service. ""The civil service was historically acknowledged as the citadel of excellence where the best brains, equipment and strategies are engaged, under your leadership, you must all work hard to bring back that type of civil service in the interest of our nation. It is in this regard I want to call on all civil servants to lend you their unalloyed support especially the permanent secretaries that will work with you and cooperate in the movement of greater efficiency, dedication and patriotism in service. ""I commend you for your devotion to the course of the Nigerian public service, you have come prepared not just academically but also by your wealth of experience, leadership capacity and administrative skills. My prayer is that let the end of your tenure be heralded as era of remarkable improvement in the quality of service in our country,"" he said. Goni told State House correspondents later that he will focus on the President's directives to re-position the civil service. ""Our immediate priority as directed by President is to re-position the civil service for the attainment of the objectives under the Transformation Agenda of government and how we intend to do this is that we will slightly depart from the way we do things in the past. ""We will emphasise on fast-tracking the processes so that we will ensure there are concrete outcomes for our people to see and that is the immediate priority that I will put my attention to."" He said: ""On the issue of job racketeering, as usual just like any other sector of our national life, you must know there are syndicates, there are crooks who tap into the websites of agencies that are not even known to those agencies and before you know it, unsuspecting Nigerians are found in the hands of those dubious characters."""331,The Sun (Nigeria),3/30/2013,Taming the monster called corruption,,AFRICA (94%); NIGERIA (94%); NORWAY (93%),1228,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,30-Mar-13,,720 words,RELIGION (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); ENDOWMENTS (89%); NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (76%); PARENT COMPANIES (76%); OIL & GAS INDUSTRY (76%); BUSINESS EDUCATION (75%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (71%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (69%),"By OBIAGELI UKEOMA It is in Proverbs 10: 22 that the Bible declared: ""The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and He addeth no sorrow with it."" This injunction is a promise of God to mankind. However, in Nigeria and of course, Africa generally, the reverse seems to be the case because there are too many greedy people in government Corruption, the manifestation of greed, is endemic in the extractive industry. However, in a bid to enthrone transparency in this critical sector, and following the gradual return of stakeholders' confidence, PWYP Norway and Norwegian School of Economics (NHH), with support from Norad and Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, organised a conference on Financial Secrecy, Society and Vested Interest in Bergen, last year. The choice of the conference title was informed by the fact that secrecy in the extractive industries has really impoverished the citizens of resource rich countries, which paradoxically is the ""resource curse."" Nigeria, which is endowed with natural resources, ranging from coal, diamond, gold, limestone, iron ore etc, is a typical victim of the curse. The high level of corruption and theft due to lack of transparency, particularly the oil and gas industry, is quite alarming. The oil sector in the world has, over the years, gained notoriety as a place where corruption thrives and a few individuals drain the country of its resources, which could, otherwise, have been used for the development of the nation. The oil resources led to massive corruption and civil strife, instead of being a blessing. It is farcical that African countries which are endowed with natural resources are poor due to lack of transparency and accountability by both the government and the companies licensed to operate in these countries. I feel duty bound, as a participant in the said conference, to share some of the views on the need for transparency, if Nigeria and Africa as a whole is to benefit from its natural resources. Some issues in the financial secrecy include but not limited to the lawyer's confidentiality and tax havens. The name secrecy jurisdiction is preferred to tax haven because these jurisdictions sell services to foreigners. The huge financial income made is being transferred to the parent companies' country, thereby impoverishing the African nations and impacting them negatively. Considering the spate of corrupt practices by the government, as a result of the fact that the Nigerian economy is substantially public sector driven, mainly funded from the oil revenue, which, ultimately, remains a monopoly of government, the country loses a lot of money as a result of financial secrecy. The resources lost, if quantified, can provide good roads, good hospitals, good schools, all social amenities in all the local governments, thereby reducing the mortality rate in the nations. Transparency, which is the watchword in the management of natural resources in Nigeria, should be imbibed by all stakeholders in the sector. As a matter of fact, it should be one of the values associated with the companies involved in the exploitation of natural resources. For corruption to be curbed, every public expenditure and income should be put in a public domain for easy access to financial users. All other transparency initiatives focus on disclosing tax payments. The extended country-by-country reporting is the only reporting standard that requires companies to report their activities on country-by-country basis, in their host countries as well as their home countries. It is the only transparency reporting that is useful to all users of financial statements. The Nigerian government should, as a way of salvaging the country and promoting transparency in EI sector, consider the following: Avoid negotiations with companies; there should be fiscal terms in law instead of in contract; complete tax system and equal terms for all companies. If indeed we are serious about turning Nigeria around to a productive, progressive, corruption free country where men and women, rich and poor, indigene or non-indigene, royalty or commoner, able bodied or living with disability can realise their aspirations, utilise their potentials and function maximally, we must be ready for radical changes in our ways of thinking and doing things.

Justice Akanbi gave the warning while delivering a keynote address at the 46th annual conference of the Nigerian Association of Law Teachers (NALT) held at the University of Ilorin (UNILORIN) with the theme: Corruption and National Development. The eminent jurist lamented the increasing wave of unbridled corruption and criminality in the country, which, he said, could only be curbed if those in power had the political will to do so. In his lecture, Justice Akanbi said: ""Bare-faced looting of public treasury, fuel subsidy scam, pension scam, money laundering, economic crimes of all sorts, oil bunkering, kidnapping, cold blooded murder, massacre, grand and petty corruption are now common day occurrences and they are all committed with reckless abandonment and impunity."" He submitted that given the frenzied and fluid state of affairs in the country, the nation is on the path to the predicted failed state because ""corruption breeds inefficient economic outcome, impedes long term foreign and domestic investment, reduces ability of the state to revise revenue, impedes the state's ability to provide essential public goods and services, promotes inflationary trends, undermines and reduces efficiency of professionals, makes project planning difficult, creates social unrest and undermines the legitimacy of state."" The former ICPC chairman said Nigeria's poor transparency rating was due largely to lack of political will to confront the menace of corruption frontally and head on. He observed that the gradual decline and observable weaknesses of governmental institutions over the years to face the challenges of failing economy, political institutions and system were parts of the causes of corruption in the country. Challenging the judiciary to also take its place in the fight against corruption, the elder statesman said: ""The judiciary must be independent if it is to effectively play the role of an arbiter and ensure that the rule of law prevails."" In his opening remarks, President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Mr. Okey Wali, called on universities in the country to review their curricula to include professional ethics.  He noted that universities in the country must introduce professional ethics in their curricula to address the problem of lawyers lacking in ethical knowledge. While describing corruption as the biggest cancer and worst problem facing the nation, Wali noted that the recent American report indicting the country on the issue of corruption only served to remind the nation of a problem that was well known. Earlier in his welcome address, Vice Chancellor of the University of Ilorin, Prof. AbdulGaniyu Ambali described the conference theme as apt and timely. The vice chancellor, who was represented on the occasion by the Deputy Vice Chancellor (RTI), Prof. Felix Oladele, also noted that corruption was not a new phenomenon but a disease that had eaten up every facet of the Nigerian society. President, Nigerian Association of Law Teachers (NALT), and acting Dean of Law, UNILORIN, Dr. Abdulqadir Ibrahim Abikan, in his remarks stated that the NALT conference had become a household event through which law teachers throughout the country gathered to ruminate on topical national issues.

Although this negative profiling of Nigeria is not entirely surprising, it is a dent on the country's image. The damming report, said to have been submitted to the United States Congress by the Secretary of State, John Kerry, is lifted from a document entitled ""Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012"". The document prepared by the US State Department, was sourced from information from US embassies and consulates abroad, foreign government officials, non-governmental and international organisations and published reports. Among other things, it alleges that though Nigerian laws provide criminal penalties for official corruption, government has done little or nothing to implement the laws effectively. The outcome of this failure to implement anti-corruption laws, the report further alleges, is that public officials in Nigeria frequently engaged in corrupt practices with impunity. Besides, the report took a swipe at the Nigerian judiciary, accusing our judges of taking bribes, thereby making it difficult to render impartial judgments, while litigants wait for long periods for their cases to be heard. Over all, the scathing report estimated that Nigeria lost about N1.067 trillion ($6.8 billion) to what it calls endemic corruption and entrenched inefficiency. Expectedly, the Federal Government has reacted forcefully to the US report. President Goodluck Jonathan described the report as skewed, overblown and unrealistic. He said his administration has not relented in its fight against corruption, insisting that all the relevant laws are being applied against those who have corruption cases against them, contrary to the allegation that his administration is treating corruption with kid gloves. Despite the government's defence, the unassailable fact is that corruption in Nigeria has gone a notch higher in recent years. This is not only among politicians occupying high public offices, it has permeated Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of government, as a recent anti-graft watchdog report revealed. This is a serious cause for worry. To continue to play the ostrich on the problem of corruption as the government is currently doing is to live in denial. The US report may have seemed alarming, but it is obvious that government is losing steam in the fight against corruption. This gives critics the impression that this administration is not demonstrating enough will to tackle corruption. It is also common knowledge that there are some glaring cases in which the government has not demonstrated seriousness in its anti-corruption crusade. Nigerians and the international community have been following the cases of corruption being handled by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC). All eyes are on Nigeria to see the conclusion of these cases. The handling and eventual resolution of the cases will go a long way in convincing skeptics that government is, indeed, committed to tackling corruption. Therefore, if the US report is the prodding that our government needs to ginger up the anti-graft crusade, it is welcome. There is no doubt that corruption, especially in high places, has become a threat to the nation's economy and a danger to our democracy. It is high time the Goodluck Jonathan administration got more serious with the fight against corruption. At the moment, government seems too tolerant of the menace. It appears to lack the political will to confront corruption head-on. This does our national image more harm than good. Let our leaders excise the cancer of corruption from Nigeria."334,The Sun (Nigeria),5/8/2013,"N'Assembly workers protest alleged corruption, illegal deductions",,NIGERIA (94%),1228,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,8-May-13,"ABUJA, NIGERIA (92%)",390 words,CORRUPTION (91%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); WAGES & SALARIES (90%); PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (89%); PETITIONS (78%); APPROPRIATIONS (78%),"From IHEANACHO NWOSU, Abuja Activities at the National Assembly were yesterday paralysed as staff protested alleged corruption and questionable deductions from their salaries by the management.

Discussions at the conference will focus on the constitutional review by the National Assembly, amnesty for Boko Haram sect, the national insecurity, corruption and national development. Other topics for discussion include the national centenary dialogue and renegotiation on the basis for national unity and the emergency preparation for the prompt arrest of the anticipated flood disaster in 2013 by the relevant sectors of the economy among others. The conference is the third of its series.ŒæIt debuted and was held in Ibom Hotels and Resort, Uyo, Akwa Ibom State in July 2012 under the chairmanship of Chief Edwin Cark. It was followed by another held in Enugu under the chairmanship of former Vice President, Alex Ekweme. A communiquí© is expected to be issued at the end of the conference."336,The Sun (Nigeria),6/2/2013,God used me to fight corruption in Nigerian football - Lulu,,NIGERIA (96%),1228,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,2-Jun-13,"ABUJA, NIGERIA (90%)",1100 words,SPORTS BUSINESS (90%); SOCCER TOURNAMENTS (90%); SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (89%); SPORTS AWARDS (89%); FIFA WORLD CUP (89%); SPORTS & RECREATION (88%); ELECTIONS (76%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (73%); TOURNAMENTS (73%); DUE PROCESS (70%); CORRUPTION (69%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (69%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (69%); HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS (68%),"By ROMANUS UGWU, Abuja Alhaji Sani Lulu Abdullahi will certainly occupy an enviable position when the history of Nigerian football administration is documented. He came, he saw and glamorised football administration in the country while he lasted as the 'Lord of the Glass House'. Even though not many will concur with the above assertion, the Kogi State-born Quantity Surveyor had battled relentlessly to convince Nigerians to accord him some respect for the impressive input he made in the development of football in the country. Fielding questions from the media during his recent birthday celebration at his FOSLA Academy in Abuja, Lulu spoke on a wide range of issues, especially the continued cry of financial crisis by the current board of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), the debate over Super Eagles players' winning match bonuses and the rumoured anointing of a candidate for the upcoming 2014 NFF presidential election. Read on! Cry of lack of funds by NFF officials I was once the president of NFF and I saw it all. That's why it's always very important that I share my little experiences, especially now that normalcy is returning to the system. I was in the football federation for about four years based on the mandate that was given to me. I started on a very pathetic note because I inherited a debt profile of over N300million. There was absolutely nothing in the coffers of the NFF when we came on board. But while I was leaving office in 2010, though through fraudulent impeachment, I left an amount totaling N2.8billion in various accounts of the body despite the fact that I did not run a revenue-generating organisation. Mindful of the fact that 2010 was the peak period for Nations Cup and World Cup, N500million and N900million were respectively released for the events by the government. What I got from government as at July 2010 was less than N2billion. You can imagine that with all those hectic programmes, I prosecuted those tournaments and still left N2.8billion in the coffers of the NFF. I challenge anybody to refute my claim. Debt for the current board Incidentally, there was no statement of account when I left office. But it is on record that I lent the federation some money from my personal account. There're due processes of remitting funds and I want to believe that, as at the time we're talking about, there could be some pockets of debts here and there. But even though there was no detailed account, I doubt if the total debt was up to N100million. That was not anything close to the money I left behind. For clarity sake, the amount I left behind was part of the $8million proceed from the 2010 World Cup, the $5.5million payment from Nigeria 2009 FIFA Under-17 World Cup and a leftover of about N400million from the federal government grant for the World Cup. We had up to that amount because we crashed out of the World Cup early. Unfortunately, the claim that my administration left some debts behind had continued to reverberate. When I took the mantle of leadership from Alhaji Ibrahim Galadima, the news was that his administration left some money in the coffers of the Nigeria Football Association (NFA), but I felt indicted because I met over N300million debts on ground. I refuted that claim with facts and bank statements. It was different from my claim. I made a statement of fact that I left N2.8billion in the coffers of the federation and till today, nobody has disputed my claim. This has no relationship with the court contempt case we are currently facing. For me, I know that I left a healthy system. Conception of Nigerians Some people used the power they have in government to give a very wrong impression about my administration, painting us as corrupt individuals, but I sincerely believe that at the appropriate time, we will expose those people. I spoke to the media recently, where I challenged Nigerians that anybody with any evidence against me should come and confront me with facts. For the records, no corrupt person would be given less than N2billion to run his administration within a year and the person will leave behind more than N2.8billion while being illegally impeached from office. It is on record that a non-fund generating organisation was able to leave such an amount in its coffers. Can I be corrupt with all these evidences on ground? Alleged corrupt practices For the fact that I was part of the system, I cannot exonerate myself from corruption in the Glass House during my regime. But I must confess that I fought corruption headlong for the four years I ran Nigerian football. The facts are there to substantiate my claims. I suspended the issuance of ITC (International Transfer Certificate) and FIFA Players Agent certification for one year because I was not too sure about the transparency in handling those issues. I insisted on knowing the standard and the nitty-gritty in those transactions. I fine-tuned the issuance of ITC to conform to the international standard. Then, I was ready to indict, discipline or even terminate the appointment of anybody that was found wanting in the deal. I hate illegality and nobody can accuse me of getting involved in such. However, I cannot beat my chest and claim that we wiped out corruption in the Glass House completely because I couldn't have been everywhere at the same time. But the good thing is that we put down the structures with which to fully eradicate corruption from the system and God used me to fight corruption in the system headlong. Regrets? I sincerely believe that God used Nigerians to put me in the Glass House and He had His reasons for making it possible. I'm not aggrieved at all, but I must confess that some people actually offended me and by offending me, they offended God. Those people only deprived Nigerians of enjoying the smooth continuity of what we had in stock for the nation. We came to redirect and re-engineer Nigerian football with the vision of using the power of the game to develop the future of the Nigerian youth. We were carefully pursuing the programme before it was truncated along the line. It's only Nigerians that can assess us with what we did, what our predecessors did and what our successors are currently doing now. Return to the Glass House I'm not in the mood to campaign for any position and I had repeatedly said it that I did not leave anything at the Glass House that I would want to go back to collect. I spent my personal money to develop Nigerian football. So, I'm leaving everything to Nigerians to judge. But the ultimate person that determines the destiny of any man is God and He does it at His own time."337,The Sun (Nigeria),6/10/2013,Why corruption cases fail in court - Agbakoba,,NIGERIA (97%); UNITED STATES (92%),1228,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,"ARIZONA, USA (76%)",10-Jun-13,,1569 words,MIRANDA RULE (93%); CORRUPTION (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (89%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (89%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (88%); FINANCIAL CRIME COUNTERMEASURES (78%); LITIGATION (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (78%); BUSINESS & PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS (78%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (77%); SUPREME COURTS (76%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (75%); ARRESTS (73%); POLICE FORCES (72%); HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS (71%),"Former president of the Nigeria Bar Association, Olisa Agbakoba (SAN), in this interview with journalists, said the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the police have not done well in the prosecution of suspects. RAZAQ BAMIDELE brings the excerpts: You joined the defence team of your client, Mr. Seun Ogunbambo, who is standing trial for alleged subsidy fraud. Don't you think the grounds of your application to quash the case, which you referred to as ""Miranda Rights"" is alien to our legal system? What is Miranda Right and how does it apply in this case? Miranda rights are very applicable to Nigerians. It's a name that derives from the American decision when Miranda, a black person, was beaten to death by the police and Miranda's family brought an action against the state of Arizona and the Supreme Court decided that the Miranda right was entrenched in the fifth amendment of the American constitution. Now, in Nigeria, the origin of Miranda rights is quite old. It is traceable to the very widely known practice of the police; to beat people and extract information, which they call confessionals. When you read the report when I was the president of the Nigerian Civil Liberty Organisation (CLO), we found out that as high as 80 per cent of the people in police custody were forced to make confessions and a very sensible rule was put in place, which was called the 'judge's rule', which required the judge to ensure that a statement of an accused person has been responsibly taken at the police station and signed by a senior police officer. Now, that judge's rule is enshrined in section 35 of the constitution akin to Miranda right. All it says is that a person who is going to make a statement must receive legal advice immediately upon his arrest because it is that legal advice he receives that proves to the court that his rights have not been violated and in particular, his statement has been voluntarily made. I have studied a number of cases and in particular the one I am doing, and when I did not see the application of the Miranda rights, I said no, that is serious. It is a very serious issue and I felt it is important that the right be contested in court. No, it is not alien to Nigeria. And how can it cause more trouble for my client? No!Œæ Rather it will establish whether his statement was made voluntarily because the caution required in the statement was not contained. But has the Miranda law been argued in any Nigerian court before now? This is the first time and somebody must start something. The constitution is in the interest of Nigeria. So, I am not talking (just) to raise my voice. What is your take on the operational mode of the EFCC in handling the subsidy probe? Not just the subsidy probe; everything. I don't rate the EFCC highly in their prosecutorial methods. I know of some of my very good colleagues in the EFCC who have performed very well, and I can mention Rotimi Jacobs (SAN). But I speak generally - we are talking on whether the EFCC should be restructured. Not just the EFCC, what of the police? The police force is a disgrace. Because at least, EFCC (personnel) are lawyers, but the police are not lawyers, so the police can prosecute, and prosecuting a crime is not an easy thing because you have to understand what you are doing and you have to be trained. So, a lot goes on at the levels of law, whether EFCC or the police because they are not trained. If as a persecutor, I am reading the file brought by Mr. X and an EFCC investigating officer says this is a file I have investigated and I feel that you, the legal officer will make a charge. That is how it starts. It is the EFCC investigative side that first takes off the case; gathers all the pieces evidence and then says we think something should be done here. Do they do it? I challenge the EFCC to confirm or deny that they have a meeting where they say how many files do we have? Who is the investigating officer? You, did you check to see that all the elements that constitute murder are present? They don't do that! They just say we don't like you, put him in jail. Go and get witness from everybody. When you get it, collect and put it in proof and when you put it in the proof, take him to court. In one case in Abuja, I told the judge that my Lord, I can't read this thing. I'm entitled by Section 35 (2), to provide legal representation for my client, but if I cannot read the document, how can I do so? And I'm bringing that in this case too because they have charged the man with offences giving a bundle but when I read the bundle, they are all jumbled- disjointed- not even paginated. So, if you say the man forged something, I cannot tell where I can find it. Because in the olden days, a statement with which a man is to be charged with an offence is a sacred document. The judge reads it thoroughly. Here, how many judges read the proofs before they give consent? They just pile the files in the judge's chamber and they say what do you want? Consent? That was why Gani (Fawehinmi, SAN) challenged the principle of consent many years ago. Consent to prosecute is a serious thing. My point is that the entire chain of prosecution that begins from investigation, to prosecution, to the judge's consent is all messed up. So by the time you are in the hands of an experienced constitutional-criminal lawyer like me, they can tear it apart. So, the entire fuel subsidy crisis has not been handled well because Nigerians were very disappointed. In fact, not disappointed Nigerians were shocked to their bone marrow that this type of thing is happening. And for me, in the maritime industry, I was absolutely stunned because I never knew that this type of thing was happening. So what Nigerians seek to see is a vigorous campaign to recover the money. But I don't even know how much was stolen. I have forgotten because today they say it is this, tomorrow they say it is that. But whatever, what the EFCC should tell us now is ""so much has been recovered."" Don't blame defence lawyers who take advantage of EFCC's weakness. Like Seun, because Seun is entitled to the presumption of innocence, so it is you who says he has done something that should make sure that the case is respected because the matter is all being bungled, nobody has any clue about what has gone on. If I were the EFCC Chairperson, here is what I would have done; I would have written a memo to Mr. President, I would tell him, Mr. President, this is a highly specialised matter and I don't have the skills to handle it. We need to retain competent private prosecutors. Agree with their terms of engagement and go to court. That is what happens in England. In England, you have what is called the Crown Persecution Service; it is headed by the Attorney-General. It is a highly organised and proficient prosecution service. Before they go to court, the evidence must be good. That is why they nailed Ibori and that is why the same Ibori could not be nailed here. Because Crown Persecution Service is no child's play. But the ministry of justice, with due respect to them because they are my friends, is not just working. So, you have no result from the fuel subsidy scam because the prosecutorial skill is weak. Do you think the House of Representatives report on the subsidy probe can be useful? The House of Representatives report on subsidy is what informed the EFCC probe. So I think they have exhausted their own part - they have done their own beat and the names they have sent off to EFCC are the ones the EFCC is now required to technically examine, so you don't waste time prosecuting a person who turns out to be innocent. I have also discovered from my years of experience that there is always public sentiment in everything such that while the fuel scam was a huge thing, I was shocked to be informed, even though I still don't believe, I thought that the entire scam was as big as ninety per cent, but that should have been the first thing that the EFCC should have deciphered so that we know who to concentrate on, so that there is no need to work on a large number of files if most of the files will not yield result. Nigeria has been repeatedly ranked among of the most corrupt nations in the world. How do you think the federal government can tackle the scourge of corruption? First is the will- to have the desire inside. You must desire it from the inside. If I want to be a lawyer, I must desire it. When that desire is there, then we must translate it by asking the right questions. Now, the right question will be how do we mount an effective anti-corruption campaign? What do we have as our anti-corruption campaign? And like I said earlier to you, my good friend Larry Diamond, one of the world's leading professors on this subject, when he gave a lecture on this topic; what rings in my ear was when he said ""perception"", you know perception is almost like fear. There is a perception that if you move about in the night you will be mowed. You may not. So, you will say are you going out in the night? Don't go! So there must be a perception that engaging in corrupt practices will land you in jail. In England, it is known and the thing in England is not to be caught but if you are caught you are gone. But here in Nigeria, whether you are caught or not, nothing happens to you. I have seen many people- a man who is under-going trial and who is still flying around in private jets and planes."338,The Sun (Nigeria),7/2/2013,"Nigeria is fighting corruption with bows, arrows -CJN",,NIGERIA (99%),1228,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,2-Jul-13,"ABUJA, NIGERIA (90%)",537 words,CORRUPTION (94%); POLITICS (89%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (86%); EMERGING MARKETS (78%); JUDICIAL ETHICS (78%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (77%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (73%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (70%); BUDGETS (69%); BUSINESS & PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS (69%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (64%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (54%),"From GODWIN TSA Abuja The Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Mariam Aloma Mukhtar has described the anti-corruption war in the country as a gun-war being fought with bows and arrows with high level of manipulations that turn its fighters into victims and those being fought into heroes. While maintaining that corruption remained one of the most widespread social ills in Nigeria, Justice Mukhtar expressed worry that the fight against the hydra-headed monster had been enmeshed in high-wired politics, controversies and manipulations to gain personal and political points. The CJN, who spoke yesterday in Abuja, at a 2-day seminar by the Anti-Corruption Commission of the Nigerian Bar Association on the theme: Practical Ways to Combat Corruption in the Justice Sector in Nigeria, said: ""Corruption generally is not only peculiar to Nigeria, it is a global phenomenon. However, anti-corruption war in Nigeria is like a gun-war being fought with bows and arrows, it is a war that can turn its fighters into victims and those being fought into heroes, it is a war that both sides manipulate to gain personal and political points, it is a 'world' of controversies, politics, extensive debates and high public expectations. It follows that it is a war that all hands must be on deck. Government alone cannot carry out this fight. We must all participate to ensure victory over this hydra-headed monster termed corruption."" Mukhtar further submitted that corruption in Nigeria had generated an adverse effect on social and economic development as well as in nation building, ""which in turn has led to an offspring of negative effects like diversion of development resources for private gain, loss of tax revenue, negative impact on quality of infrastructure and public service and reduction in the pace of economic growth. ""Agreed, the problem of corruption is not with the bench alone but the whole Nigerian society but painful thing however, is when the judiciary which is held in the highest esteem is also allegedly infiltrated with the virus."" She posited that strengthening judicial integrity in Nigeria and discouraging corruption could be better achieved with strict compliance with the code of conduct for judicial officers. ""It is necessary to ensure that every officer entrusted with the sacred duty of dispensing justice does so with uprightness and the utmost sense of integrity. Corruption in the judiciary undermines fragile democratic systems by fuelling popular disillusionment with custodians of the country's justice system. It also undermines trust and confidence, which are necessary for upholding and development of sustainable economic and social order."" The CJN also called for an improved funding of the judiciary, stressing that the recent depreciation in budgetary allocation for the judiciary portends great danger in the fight against corruption in the judiciary. ""Judicial officers must be comfortable to enable them discharge their duty wholly without anticipation for graft. Let me use this opportunity to urge all of us present here and beyond to imbibe in us the spirit of transparency, integrity and accountability in our private and public transactions in a bid to stemming corruption in Nigeria."""339,The Sun (Nigeria),8/31/2013,Why I'm fighting corruption in Nigerian football -Bewarang,,NIGERIA (99%),1228,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,6-Sep-13,,197 words,CORRUPTION (92%); ATHLETES (90%); COACHES & TRAINERS (90%); STADIUMS & ARENAS (77%); SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (77%),"President of Nigeria Coaches Association (NCA), Bitrus Bewarang, said he is determined in his fight against corruption in Nigerian football to protect the means of livelihood of the coaches and footballers.

The conference, which had as its theme: ""Institutions, Institutional Reforms and Eeconomic Development"" is the single largest gathering of economists in the country. Jonathan said the fight against corruption was not what the government alone could handle but that it should be fought by both public and private institutions because they are also involved in sharp practices. The president, however, advised that the people should stop creating environments where criminals would be tempted to take what belongs to the public. ""We believe that we should not create an environment where people would be tempted to take what belongs to the public because that is why even in the fertilizer business we talk about electronic wallet so that funds are not exposed to corrupt people. When you talk about corruption, the private sector is involved; the public sector is involved; even the individuals, including other societies and I wouldn't want to mention names so that I will not be attacked. But I know that if collectively all of us don't reward corruption, people would not be attracted to corrupt practices but when we all reward corruption, then, of course, we will be tempted to go in that direction,"" he said. Jonathan noted that the Federal Government would continue to strengthen all anti-corruption agencies with a view to making them impregnable. According to him, the Federal Government's approach to fighting corruption was targeted at building institutions that had the capacity to overcome corrupt influences. This approach, he added, would use the rule of law as a framework to fight corruption. In this regard, he said the leadership of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC) have been repositioned to ensure more effective, efficient and transparent way of managing corruption and corrupt practices. ""I want a society where all of us will frown upon people who come up with what they are not supposed to have. (If) a young man who just started a job and within six months or a year comes up with a car of N7 million to N15 million and you clap for him, then you are rewarding corruption. So, for us as a nation to bring corruption down in Nigeria, it is not just blaming government or blaming police but all individuals must frown upon people who have what they are not supposed to have, who live in houses they are not supposed to live in; who drive cars they are not supposed to drive and who wear suits more expensive than their income."341,The Sun (Nigeria),9/26/2013,Jonathan's preachment on corruption,,NIGERIA (97%),1228,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,26-Sep-13,"ABUJA, NIGERIA (92%)",793 words,CORRUPTION (94%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (89%); FINANCIAL CRIME COUNTERMEASURES (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (76%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (74%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (74%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (73%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (69%),"President Goodluck Jonathan, at the recently concluded 54th Annual Conference of the Nigerian Economic Society (NES) in Abuja, lamented the growing incidence of corruption in both the public and private sectors despite institutional reforms put in place to check graft. According to the president, corruption persists at both individual and corporate levels mainly because Nigerians ""reward corrupt practices through their actions"". On the issue of graft in high places, Jonathan declined to disclose the names of those already caught in the web, because, in his words, ""so that I would not be attacked"". He, however,Œæ claimed that the leadership of the two major anti-graft agencies, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission(EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other-related Offences Commission (ICPC) have been re-postioned to resist corrupt influences and ensure effective investigation and prosecution of corruption cases. Painting a lurid picture of how corruption has gained a strong foothold in the nation, the president said that our society encourages corruption, citing the case of a young man who got a job and within one year bought a choice car of between N7 million and N15 million, and the society clapped for him.ŒæHe advocated collective effort in the fight against graft, instead of heaping the blame at the doorsteps of government and its institutions. Jonathan's acknowledgment of the unwholesome impact of corruption on the nation's development is apt. We agree with his argument that both the public and private sectors as well as individual citizens have soiled their hands with corrupt practices. This negative tendency is generously nurtured by the galling erosionŒæ of our societal moral values. However, the failure of successive Nigerian governments to tackle corruption, especially amongst public officials,Œæ emboldens treasury looters. Mere condemnatory speeches without concrete action to stop the menaceŒæ will not achieve any positive result. It is disheartening that while bemoaning and condemning corruption on one hand, our leaders have shown clear indecisiveness in dealing with the problem. In some instances, anti-graft agencies are teleguided by the governments which appear too tolerant and accommodating of corrupt officials, for a variety of reasons. ThisŒæ partly explains why, for many years now, Nigeria has remained in the top bracket of the most corrupt nations in the world. Therefore, toŒæ effectively check corruption, the Federal Government should go beyondŒæ preachments. It must demonstrate the political will to deal with graft. At present, the government and anti-corruption agencies are, in many cases, biased. There is no evidence that the government is committed to prosecuting corruption cases to their logical conclusion. In recent years, corruption allegations have been widely reported in the three arms of government. The Executive,Œæ Legislature and the Judiciary, alongside key government parastatals and a number of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of government all have cases of corruption that are begging for resolution. In all of these, the anti-graft agencies and the police have done little to prosecute the offenders to deter others from such acts. There are also the cases of corruption by foreign contractors engaged by the government thatŒæ were indicted in oil and national identity cards bribery scams involving top government officials, but little was done to prosecute the indicted Nigerian officials. It is glaring from these cases that the government treats corruption cases with kid gloves. This is responsible for the way that the problem continues to thrive in the country. Few months ago, the US Congress claimedŒæ that it received a document fromŒæ State Department detailing ""massive corruption"" at all levels of government in Nigeria. The report might have been somewhat exaggerated, but the sources of the information entitled: ""Country Report of Human Rights Practices"" in Nigeria for 2012, substantially reflects the corruption index in Nigeria. This is most unfortunate. Oftentimes,Œæ public officials take advantage of their positions to engage in corrupt practices with impunity. They, most times,Œæ go scot-free. This is not due to the fact that there are no laws in place to punish offenders, but largely because the laws are rarely enforced. Without a doubt, corruption is a threat to the society, the economy and the image of the country. It poses a grave danger to our democracy. It is about time that government got serious with tackling corruption in both the public and private sectors. The fight against corruption must begin with the government leading the way. It goes beyond tedious moralizing to clear and resolute action to stem the trend."342,The Sun (Nigeria),10/19/2013,Only Nigerians can end corruption -Waziri,,NIGERIA (96%); UNITED STATES (79%),1228,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,19-Oct-13,,680 words,CORRUPTION (92%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); FINANCIAL CRIME COUNTERMEASURES (73%); HORSES (70%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (68%); PRIME MINISTERS (67%); OIL & GAS PRICES (50%),"Œ‡Says Zazzau emirate durbar commendable From NOAH EBIJE,ŒæKaduna Former Chairman, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mrs Farida Waziri has said that until all Nigerians, irrespective of their positions in the society realize the danger of corruption in the nation and join hands to fight the menace, it would be difficult to wipe it out. Speaking to Saturday Sun as a special guest of the Emir of Zazzau, Alhaji Shehu Idris at the emirate's Durbar (horse riding) to mark sallah celebration at the Emir 's palace on Thursday, Waziri noted that the dimension corruption has taken shows that it is not a battle to be left for anti-graft agencies alone. She said it was wrong for people to say that corruption is a Nigerian factor, lamenting that such imposed belief could brand Nigerians as naturally corrupt. The former EFCC boss also urged the striking university lecturers to consider the plight of the students and go back to classes, saying that they could always continue their negotiations with government while they resume work. According to her, ""on the issue of corruption, I want every Nigerian to understand that corruption is not identified with one segment, and it is an issue that not only the authorities empowered to fight corruption should handle alone, it is a collective responsibility. ""As I always say, the moment every Nigerian realizes the danger of corruption, the damage it does to the country, and say enough is enough, corruption will be wiped out. But the moment it is accepted as a way of life, you hear people saying it is a Nigerian factor, meaning that we are corrupt by nature, this is wrong. Have you ever heard of American factor or UK factor? It is Nigerians themselves, and a little issue like somebody tampering with pump price, this is an act of corruption that can lead to many disastrous consequences for the country. Then, look at the case of a driver conniving with a mechanic to remove a new part from a car and replace it with an old one, its consequences could lead to multiple deaths, so there are many areas of corruption that need to be addressed. Everybody should play his or her own role. ""On ASUU strike, I am not happy that the strike continues, most Nigerians like myself support theŒæ demands of our lecturers. These are people who train presidents, vice presidents, senate presidents, prime ministers, governors, but look at their plight, they are not respected, they are not accorded dignity and people look at them as ordinary teachers. I think something should be done because these people are very important, without them you know how the education system will look like. ""In spite of all these, I want them to look at the bigger picture, look at the great country, Nigeria that we have, and in the name of Nigeria, go back to classes, and accept what government has offered now so that the negotiation can continue even while they resume work. Also, they should look at the students, young people who are now at home as leaders of tomorrow, they should consider this"". She also spoke about the importance of the durbar, saying that it was an event that encourages peaceful co-existence among various ethnic groups in the country. ""This event is very important to me; it is my first time of witnessing it.Œæ It is one of our cultural heritages, and the emir is one of the greatest monarchs in this country. I decided to honour the invitation, and I feel very peaceful, and I feel that gradually peace is returning to the country"", she said. Some people on the occasion also spoke to Saturday Sun of the significance of the celebration. According to one of the emir's sons, Umar Shehu Idris: ""This year durbar is a joyous celebration, and as tradition requests, we celebrate it every year, and as you can see, the emir has gone out in a colourful traditional attire, looking handsome as if he is still a young man. Many people came from different parts of the country to witness this particular event. The durbar otherwise known as traditional Hawan Daushe is a traditional horse riding which is a symbol of war of olden days."343,The Sun (Nigeria),10/31/2013,"Official secrets, official corruption and FOI Act",,NIGERIA (94%),1228,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,31-Oct-13,"LAGOS, NIGERIA (73%)",1202 words,POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); FREEDOM OF INFORMATION (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); CIVIL AVIATION (78%); ADMISSIONS & CONFESSIONS (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (74%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (73%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (72%); JUDGES (67%); CRIMINAL LAW (66%); NATIONAL SECURITY (62%); CIVIL SERVICES (61%),"By:Œæ Ajuzie C. Osondu In the wake of recent allegations of fraudulent purchase of two armoured vehicles by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority for the Honourable Minister of Aviation, Stella Oduah, there have been reports of attempts to sidetrack the crux of the matter - official corruption, and be chasing those who revealed information relating to the purchase. There is no doubt that if they are found, their ""heads will roll"".Œæ As a legal practitioner, I am not unmindful of the fact that this is still a mere allegation until the truth of the matter has been established.Œæ I am also aware that the president has set up a three-man committee to investigate the allegations against the Honourable Minister of Aviation.Œæ This is consistent with the twin maxims of natural justice, namely, audi alteram partem (listen to the other side before you come to a conclusion) and nemo judex in causa sua (no man shall be a judge in his own cause). I say this because the concept of natural justice originated from God himself in the Garden of Eden.Œæ As an omniscient God, He knew that Adam and Eve had eaten the forbidden fruit, but God did not go straight to deliver judgment.Œæ He gave them opportunity to explain themselves.Œæ He still asked them if they had eaten the forbidden fruit, and as they confessed to it, there was no doubt that they were guilty, and accordingly, God pronounced them guilty as charged and then handed down their judgment.Œæ (See Genesis chapter 3 v 1ff). I have said all these not to defend the Honourable Minister, or condone official corruption in Nigeria.Œæ On the contrary, I want to use this medium to point out the interplay between official secrets, official corruption and the Freedom of Information Act and how this can be used to fight and indeed reduce official corruption in Nigeria.Œæ The laws relating to official secrets are laws that forbid civil servants from divulging information in their possession without authorization by the appropriate authority.Œæ I want to point out that the law on official secrets has been used to promote official corruption in our governmental systems over the years. This offence is provided for in Sections 59 and 60 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State and Section 97 of the Criminal Code Act as well as under the Official Secrets Act and other legislations.Œæ The provisions are targeted at employees in the public service, which will include workers in the federal and states ministries, agencies, parastatals and similar organisations.Œæ The import of the provisions is to the effect that any employee of such organisations who by virtue of his office or employment is in possession of information or document considered to be secret and as such ought to be kept secret and who without authorization discloses or hands out such information or document commits an offence for which he is liable to a term of imprisonment of between 1 and 2 years or even more. However, it is believed that recent developments in our laws have whittled down the effect of these provisions on official secrets.Œæ This is by virtue of the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, passed into law by the National Assembly in 2011. By virtue of Section 27 of the Act, the provisions of various legislations which criminalize disclosure of official secrets have been made subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.Œæ The provisions of Section 27 of the Act are reproduced below: ""Notwithstanding anything contained in the Criminal Code, Penal Code, the Official Secrets Act, or any other enactment, no civil or criminal proceedings shall lie against an officer of any public institution, or against any person acting on behalf of a public institution, and no proceedings shall lie against such persons thereof, for the disclosure in good faith of any information, or any part thereof pursuant to this Act, for any consequences that flow from that disclosure, or for the failure to give any notice required under this Act, if care is taken to give the required notice. ""Nothing contained in the Criminal Code or Official Secrets Act shall prejudicially affect any public officer who, without authorization, discloses to any person, an information which he reasonably believes to show (a) a violation of any law, rule or regulation; (b) mismanagement, gross waste of funds, fraud, and abuse of authority; or (c) a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety notwithstanding that such information was not disclosed pursuant to the provision of this Act."" It is the humble view of this author that although public officers now enjoy some protection or immunity for disclosing certain information by virtue of Section 27 of the Act, a better approach would have been to altogether repeal the Official Secrets Act and the relevant sections of the Criminal and Penal Codes and other laws that made provisions relating to official secrets so that a single legislation, the Freedom of Information Act, would govern this subject. Such an approach, it is submitted, would be justified under the doctrine of covering the field notwithstanding any arguments to the contrary. Under the doctrine of covering the field, where the National Assembly and a state House of Assembly make identical laws on a subject matter over which both have concurrent legislative powers, the law made by the National Assembly will prevail over that made by the State House of Assembly.Œæ In the case of Attorney General of Ogun State v. Attorney General of the Federation, the Supreme Court commented as follows per Fatai Williams CJN: ""It is, of course, settled law, based on the doctrine of covering the field ... that if Parliament enacts a law in respect of any matter in which both Parliament and a Regional Legislature are empowered to make laws, and a Regional legislature enacts an identical law on the same subject matter, the law made by Parliament shall prevail.Œæ That made by the Regional legislature shall become irrelevant and therefore, impliedly repealed."" It is now clear from the above provision that a public officer can now disclose to any person, including the press, information which he or she reasonably believes to show a mismanagement or gross waste of funds, fraud, and abuse of authority without the risk of facing criminal prosecution.Œæ On this premise, I submit that NCAA officials hunting for the heads of those who revealed the information relating to the purchase of the armoured vehicles by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority for the Minister of Aviation have been disarmed by the provisions of Section 27 of the Freedom of Information Act.Œæ But for the provisions of this section of the Act, this information would have been regarded as an official secret and would have forever been shrouded in secrecy.Œæ Those who dared to reveal it would have been liable to prosecution. Public officers who have information relating to fraud, abuse of authority, mismanagement, waste of public funds and similar corrupt practices are now free to divulge such information whenever such information come to their knowledge as they are protected by the provisions of Section 27 of the Freedom of Information Act. n Deacon (Barrister) Osondu writes from Lagos"344,The Sun (Nigeria),11/3/2013,The church must fight corruption,,NIGERIA (92%),1228,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,3-Nov-13,,1096 words,RELIGION (91%); WEALTHY PEOPLE (90%); BIBLE & CHRISTIAN TEXTS (89%); CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY (88%); CORRUPTION (65%); MISDEMEANORS (61%),"By WILFRED JIBRIL  The essence of ministry, as I have emphasized severally in my previous articles, is to rescue the perishing souls and to prepare them for the coming of their Maker, the Lord Jesus Christ. But in Nigeria, ministry has been given a new name. Preaching for the genuine salvation of souls has now taken the back seat while prosperity has become the main focus of most ministers. It is unfortunate that the church, as we have today, is the antithesis of what the Lord Jesus Christ envisioned which is a Church bereft of spots and wrinkles.Œæ The love of money has so much destroyed the body of Christ that heaven is no longer the focus of most believers. It is ludicrous and preposterous to read about ministers who claim they have the anointing to make people millionaires.  The question I have for such ministers is, who bestowed such anointing on them? And where is it written in the Bible that we are called as ministers to make people millionaires? The Holy Book does not tell us that the Head of the Church, the Lord Jesus Christ, during His earthly ministry, made some people millionaires. His primary mission on earth, according to the scriptures, was to reach out to the lost sheep of the house of Israel so that they could inherit the kingdom of God after their earthly sojourn.Œæ Ephesians 4: 11-13 dwell on the primary purpose for which gifts are given to ministers of God: ""And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ"". Maybe their Bible is different from mine. Consequent upon the misdemeanour of these ministers, most church members have been misled into believing that there is nothing wrong in acquiring wealth by hook or by crook as long as they pay tithe on such money. This, undoubtedly, explains why everybody now wants to do anything to acquire money. In their foolishness, they opine that paying tithe on stolen money legitimizes it. In I Timothy 6: 9-12, the Bible says: ""But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses"". If this category of Christians reads the Bible, the above verses must have been erased from their copies of the Holy Book or the page containing them has been torn off. How else does one explain a situation whereby a Christian, who reads the aforementioned verses, still defrauds an organisation and rushes to church to pay tithe? Trust these greedy ministers. They will not query the source of the money. They will accept the tithe and extol the giver to high heavens. Sometimes, those who pay such fat tithe, get special seats in the church.Œæ A Christian paying tithe on stolen money! What an abomination and disgrace to the body of Christ! The ministers are culpable in that they are indirectly encouraging these light-fingered members to steal. To clip the wings of these thieving members, the ministers should start questioning the source of such money now. For instance, if a church member, who earns N2 million per annum, pays a tithe of about N50,000 from his/her monthly salary, he or sheŒæ should be queried. Another way to nip this scandalous development in the bud is for ministers to stop asking members to sow what they call seed of faith. Christians should be allowed to give willingly and cheerfully. Furthermore, I will suggest that ministers of God should form the habit of preaching messages of judgement against believers who have unbridled desire to acquire ill-gotten wealth. If every church is doing this at every service, there will be no hiding place for these thieving 'christians'. That way the church of Christ would have been purged of these kleptomaniacs. It is wrong for ministers to cajole members to give money or sow seed, as they say. If members of their congregation are born again, they don't need to be cajoled before they give for the work of the Lord. The Spirit of God will always lead them to do so. In fact, giving is not compulsory. It is done according to the leading of the Holy Spirit and it must be done willingly and cheerfully. It is this type of giving that brings blessings to the giver. The recent case of a convicted Army officer who allegedly defrauded a state government to the tune of N150 million and allegedly paid a tithe of N11 million in two installments to a church is an embarrassment to the body of Christ. This is not the first time we are being regaled with a story of a monumental scandal involving a Church. In 2003 or thereabouts, a self-styled Christian bought a massive generator and donated to another church from the money he allegedly pilfered from his employer. These churches are guilty as charged because they cannot claim not to know the source of their sudden wealth. Imagine a salary earner paying a tithe of N11 million. The church did not query the source of his sudden wealth; neither could any of the ministers in the church discern the source.Œæ Don't they have the spirit of discernment?Œæ Do they operate in the flesh? That is one of the reasons we ministers of God must operate in the spirit. Since the church is not a business venture, ministers should start querying members who pay questionable tithes. My take on this issue is that churches, whose preoccupation is prosperity, have the proclivity to fail into such temptation. The Lord expects these erring ministers to turn a new leaf by de-emphasising prosperity in their messages. Prosperity is not a message ministers of God should dissipate their time preaching. In fact, the beginning of prosperity is Matthew 6:33 which says: ""But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you"". The meaning of this verse of the scripture is simple. Give your life to the Lord Jesus Christ and live a righteous life and you will prosper.

The committees which is coming under the aegis ofŒæ National Association of Public Account Committees (NAPAC), and inaugurated by Senate President David Mark, is to work together to check growing profligacy in the country. According to the lawmakers who inaugurated the body in Abuja, the synergy with international financial outfits would help in ensuring international best practices in auditing government activities. The association will also be involved in the production of audit reports and collaboration with bodies such as anti-corruption agencies, civil society organisations in ensuring transparency, probity and accountability in the management of public funds. It would also liase and collaborate with regional and international associations of public accounts committees. In his speech on the occasion, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, posited that if the nation's audit system is efficient and effective, corruption and embezzlement of public funds would be greatly reduced, meaning that, agencies like the EFCC and ICPC would have less work to do. He said ""Right now, these agencies are up to their necks with cases, yet stories of embezzlement of public funds keep coming,"" Tambuwal, who was represented by House deputy minority whip, Garba Datti (APC, Kaduna), stressed. The speaker, however, promised that the House would give speedy passage to an amendment Bill to strengthen the powers of the Auditor-General. He said, ""The 1958 Audit Act has become obsolete, making Nigeria one of the few African countries without an Audit law."" Earlier, Senate President David Mark said for any parliament to discharge its responsibilities, it must have the power, not only to appropriate funds, but to ensure that funds are expended for the purposes they were meant for. He said ""The National Assembly is working assiduously to amend the constitution to empower the office of the Auditor General of the Federation and for states to perform their statutory functions better"". In his address, the new National Chairman of NAPAC and Chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Accounts, Ahmed Lawan, said the association would provide an avenue for them to develop standards in line with international best practices. Lawan said ""as government and governance become more complex and intricate and public expenditure pattern and trends expand to cover more societal needs, there is a compelling need for the legislature to improve on their effectiveness and efficiency in scrutiny and oversight of public expenditure by governments "". The senator noted that the reasons for which PAC was established about 152 years ago in Britain are still valid today in every democratic country, hence the need to ""develop standard procedures and processes to achieve the constitutional mandate of public account committees, provide avenue for interaction, sharing of experiences, ideas and information among members on issues relating to the functions of the public account committees. The committee is also mandated to develop individual capacity of members, liaise with the office of the auditor general of the federation and of states for the purpose of ensuring international best practices in auditing and production of audit reports"". Lawan also said NAPAC would collaborate with bodies such as anti-corruption agencies, civil society organisations in ensuring transparency, probity and accountability in the management of public funds of the nation and liaising and collaborating with regional and international association of public accounts committees such as West African association of Public Accounts Committees (WAAPAC), South African Development Community Organisation of Public Accounts Committees (SADCOPAC). Going further, he said that in addition to its role of scrutinising public expenditure by government a year after the funds were spent, public accounts committees also aims to ""empower its members to effectively carry out their function for Nigeria's taxpayers to get the best value for money and to monitor how funds are generated, collected and remitted into government treasuries by revenue generating agencies and tax receiving agencies"". On his own part, chairman of the House Committee on Public Accounts and deputy National Chairman, NAPAC, Hon Solomon Adeola Olamilekan, lamented while delivering his vote of thanks that the committee was monitoring monies set aside for implementing budgets which audits usually show do not get used for the intended purposes, saying they will ""disclose where the money goes at the right time"".

Agriculture is the backbone of its economy, and with increased neglect of the sector by successive administrations, it is only a matter of time for dwindling economic strength to set in. With the indigenes getting poorer, government becomes the only source of succour for the poor. It is for this reason that the state can ill-afford a thieving administration. In such a situation, when an elected governor betrays the sacred trust and steals from the people, their anger and pain run deep while their cries go far and wide, resonating in the desert. The recent discovery by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) that two sons of Governor Sule Lamido of Jigawa State are serial thieves in billions of naira can only be unfortunate and shameful. As fathers, we feel deeply hurt when our own children occupy public discourse in very negative light. This is the agony that confronts Alhaji Sule Lamido, Governor of Jigawa State, North West Nigeria. Popularly known as a member of the G-7 now taking on President Goodluck Jonathan like nobody has done in the past, Lamido is not new to the political landscape. He is also not new to corruption scandal. A man noted to possess some degree of political courage, Lamido endeared himself to many of us when he became one of the few Nigerians who spoke against the dictatorial regime of late former Head of State, General Sani Abacha. Touted as Obasanjo's boy, he was to be appointed Minister of External Affairs before 2007. In 2007, he was elected governor of Jigawa State, succeeding Alhaji Ibrahim Saminu Turaki, now a senator and a man who has been in and out of the courts, defending himself against multiple corruption charges. The EFCC is prosecuting the former governor on a 32-count charge for corruptly enriching himself to the tune of N36B belonging to Jigawa State. As if the EFCC was on its own, Turaki succeeded in finding a seat in the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, a situation made possible by the funds allegedly stolen from the people that God placed under his leadership in Jigawa State. Rather than face trial, Saminu Turaki has continuously ridiculed the EFCC as if stealing is a virtue. Our last check revealed that after he managed to transfer the graft case from Abuja to a Federal High Court in Dutse, he started staying away from the court until a warrant of arrest was issued against him by Justice S. Yahuza directing the IGP to produce him in court dead or alive and without delay. If anybody thought that the change of guard in the state in 2007 would bring hope and integrity in governance to the people of Jigawa, later events are proving that stealing, by protocol, seats in the Jigawa State Government House in Dutse. Sadly, it is for this reason that many people think that, like a stroke of fate, since the advent of the present democratic experience, Jigawa State has not been lucky to have great and exemplary governors. It is either their governors are gladly milking them dry or their sons are stealing from the public till with amazing impunity. In some cases, it is a combination of both. Accurately, scandals and allegations of corruption have not left the house of Governor Sule Lamido since 2012. He is blessed with a gift of male children. In Africa many consider children to be an asset of some sort but instead of using their talents and opportunities to promote the well being of government and people of Jigawa State, they have become vultures, reaping where they did not sow. They have become pen robbers, terrorizing the coffers of the government and people of Jigawa State with the active connivance of their father, as alleged by EFCC, at a time when poverty and security challenges stare everyone in the face. Late last year, precisely in December 2012, one of his sons Aminu Lamido was arrested at the Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport, Kano on his way to Cairo, Egypt for alleged money laundering. He was said to have declared only $10,000 out of the $50,000 in his possession, a conduct many believe, smacks of guilt and predetermined intent to commit a crime. Much as the laws of Nigeria do not forbid any person from carrying any amount of money out of the country, it is illegal not to declare such money. Failure to do so amounts to a crime. While this crime remained an embarrassment to Dutse, the EFCC has again, moved against the Lamidos, accusing the same Aminu Lamido and his brother Mustapha Lamido together with their father Alhaji Sule Lamido as running a ring of companies which were used as engines of fraud to siphon the resources of the helpless people of Jigawa State. According to the EFCC, a total sum of N11B is said to have been stolen in the process. That is why they were subsequently arrested in Kano and it has been reported that the evidence against them is weighty. Media reports also have it that the emerging facts from the investigations carried out in the earlier case of money laundering involving Aminu Lamido had given rise to the present findings and it would appear that Governor Sule Lamido cannot have sleepless nights anymore. Apart from having his two sons in the EFCC net, the governor himself who enjoys immunity now, may be arrested and prosecuted when he leaves office in 2015. Governor Sule Lamido who is a prominent member of the G-7 wants to be president of Nigeria in 2015 and has called on Jonathan to abandon the option of a second term in office. In September 2013, he said that Jonathan would use the EFCC to haunt members of the G-7 but the facts today show that the guilty is afraid. He was merely raising a false alarm to cover the misdeeds of his house. Much as nobody prays to have children that bring shame to the family, parents must be careful not to expose otherwise innocent children to avoidable temptation. While Nigerians await the outcome of this case, we believe that Governor Lamido is not alone as majority of the governors in Nigeria and their family members are stealing freely from the public till. We may crucify Governor Lamido today but he belongs to a league of powerful governors who may not make heaven on account of graft."347,The Sun (Nigeria),12/10/2013,Corruption stalls Nigeria's economic growth - UN,,NIGERIA (97%); SIERRA LEONE (79%); CAPE VERDE (79%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%); EUROPE (79%); GHANA (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (66%),1228,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,11-Dec-13,"ABUJA, NIGERIA (92%)",382 words,CORRUPTION (92%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (90%); EMERGING MARKETS (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (90%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (90%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (78%); EUROPEAN UNION (78%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (77%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (74%),"From DENNIS MERNYI, Abuja The United Nations (UN) has identified corruption in Nigeria as the factor for the stunted economic and social growth in the country.

Nigeria was ranked 144th in corruption perception index barely two weeks ago by the Transparency International. Mariam Sissoko, the representative of the UN in Nigeria, who spoke at the 2013 International Anti-Corruption Day in Abuja explained that, ""if only 10 per cent of the money lost to corruption is channeled back to development, it would be enough to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. She noted that corruption is believed to be the biggest obstacle to economic and social development around the world. According to her, corruption does not just stall economic development, it also stalls human development and restrict access to public services Speaking at the event, the chairman, Inter-Agency Task Team, Ledum Mitee, noted the country has massive corruption problem and expressed worry that Nigeria was rated the third most corrupt country in the West African sub-region. ""I am not talking here of the holistic macro-analysis of the CPI 2013. ""This is a micro-analysis which is not comparing us with developed countries but with our peers within the sub-region such as Cape Verde, Ghana, and Sierra Leone among others"". Mitee explained that Nigeria must go beyond just making laws against corruption but ensure the effective implementation of those laws holistically and across board without fear or favour. He stressed that investigating and prosecuting corruption is very expensive and time consuming and, therefore, opined that it is cheaper and more impactful to prevent corruption and close the doors to illicit activities before it happens. On his part, the representative of the European Union, Alan Munday, noted the EU would like to see an end to a culture of impunity and more cooperation among anti-corruption agencies. He noted that judges have most times thrown out corruption cases because of shoddy investigation, urging the agencies to do better investigations of corruption cases by adopting better case management system. <p class='syndigate_disclaimer'>Copyright Œ© 2013 The Sun Publishing Limited."348,The Sun (Nigeria),12/11/2013,APC hails Tambuwal's patriotic stand against corruption,,NIGERIA (94%),1228,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,11-Dec-13,"LAGOS, NIGERIA (73%)",570 words,LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS (75%); RANKINGS (50%),"The All Progressives Congress (APC) has commended the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Aminu Tambuwal, for his patriotism and dedication to the nation, following his principled stand on the Jonathan administration's tepid fight against corruption. In a statement issued in Lagos yesterday by its Interim National Publicity Secretary, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, the party said the Speaker exhibited a leadership trait that was rareŒæ by shunning partisanship to say that the President's body language does not indicate that he has the political will to fight corruption in the country. ""Tambuwal and President Jonathan belong to the same political party but this did not deter the Speaker from rising above crass partisanship when the issue involved borders on national interest. This is the stuff of good leadership. ""Tambuwal has shown that he is indeed the Speaker of the Federal House of Representatives and that the entire country is his constituency, unlike President Jonathan who has transformed himself to a PDP and a sectional leader by viewing serious issues of national importance from the prism of partisanship and sectionalism,"" it said, expressing the hope that other Nigerians will emulate the Speaker. APC said the party was delighted to be in the same company with the Speaker over the criticism of President Jonathan's nonchalant stand on corruption, which has eaten deeper into the national fabric under the present administration, adding: ""We have raised the same issues raised by the Speaker several times in our regular intervention but the administration has dismissed our concerns on the altar of partisanship. ""However, now that no less a personality than the country's number four citizen and a top member of the PDP is the one raising the issue and coming against the background of Nigeria's slide in the 2013 rankings released recently by the global anti-corruption body, Transparency International, we hope the administration will realise that it has only been paying a lip service to the anti-graft battle and perhaps make amends,"" the party said. It said the Speaker was totally right in talking about the President's body language, which is a reflection of the deceptive actions he (President Jonathan) has taken time and again over very serious issues of corruption, including the monumental fuel subsidy scam, the pension scam, the fraud involving the excess crude account, the Sure-P scandal and Oduahgate. ""These are slam dunk corruption cases that should have been handed over to the anti-corruption agencies for summary disposal. Instead, the President - thinking Nigerians will merely scream and forget after some time - engages in his usual distracting method of setting up committees, the report of which he will then put away to gather dust until another corruption case rears its ugly head. ""Nigerians are not stupid and they understand very clearly that the President is shielding corrupt people, as long as they are willing and able to contribute massively, from their ill-gotten funds, to his (President's) campaign slush funds.

In 2012, Nigeria was ranked as the 124th most corrupt nation among the less than 170 countries examined. The anti-corruption crusader named Afghanistan, North Korea and Somalia as the world's most corrupt countries while Denmark and New Zealand were given clean bills of health with little or no corruption blemish. The report gave Nigeria as an example of countries where oil resources were available to only a few elite. It is an irony that the country's oil wealth that is supposed to catalyze its development has become a main channel of corruption. Over the years, trillions of naira that the country earned from petroleum products largely ended up in private pockets to the utter detriment of the majority of the people. Each succeeding year, administration after administration, the scandal of corruption gets deeper in the country with no redemption in sight. The situation has become so bad that no government official or agency knows what the country actually earns from oil exploration and production. All the citizens get to hear are contradictory official statements on the income from the sector. Meanwhile, it is no secret that a lot of government functionaries and their cronies are feeding fat on the national wealth. This is apart from illegal bunkering that has taken a life of its own since the advent of the present administration. This poor corruption ranking should serve as a clarion call to allŒæ Nigerians and the three tiers of government to buckle up in the fight against graft. This is not a time for rebuttals or lampooning of Transparency International. The move from 124th to the 144th position on this index shows clearly that the country is not confronting the corruption monster as it should. If it were not so, there ought to have been significant improvement in Nigeria's rating. The battle against corruption is one that all Nigerians must be involved in. It should not be left to government officials alone, as the menace cuts across all strata of the society. Churches, mosques, schools, clubs, not-for-profit organisations, professional bodies, the civil service, organised private sector and the general public must join hands in combating the ogre. Nigeria's anti-corruption agencies must sit up. The impression that has been created by this ranking is that the country is losing the battle against corruption. We would have expected that with all the interventions from both national and international anti-corruption agencies, the problem would have declined by now. It does not make sense to have this menace flourishing and undermining development in the country. The only way the continuing degeneracy can be explained is that, collectively, we are not getting our acts together. Nigerians must gird their loins if this fight against corruption must be won. Otherwise, we are likely to descend further in next year's ranking. Nigeria should not be lagging behind in every human development indicator. We must strive to exit the club of notoriousŒæ nations and do all we can to become a continental reference point. We must harness our natural and human resources to uplift the country. Nigeria cannot be so blessed and yet the majority of its citizens will be living in abject poverty while a clique squanders the riches of the country through institutionalizedŒæ corruption. The time has come for us to ask questions on how the nation's oil wealth is being managed. Docility cannot correct the flaws. All those who are responsible for management of oil revenue must be made accountable. We must strive to make living above board an integral aspect of public life. This is the only way to get out of this cul-de-sac. The government needs to tighten the noose on perpetrators of illegal oil bunkering and other economic saboteurs. Severe sanctions should be meted out to public officials who compromise their offices for personal gains. The time has come, too, for Nigerians to start looking at the broader picture of corruption. It is an all-encompassing phenomenon that touches all aspects of human existence; hence, the need for concerted efforts and jettisoning of the current cavalier approach to corruption fighting. The perception of Nigeria as a sleazy nation must change. <p class='syndigate_disclaimer'>Copyright Œ© 2013 The Sun Publishing Limited."351,The Sun (Nigeria),12/15/2013,"As corruption deepens, EFCC chases rats in Imo State",,NIGERIA (98%); SWITZERLAND (79%),1228,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,16-Dec-13,"BERN, SWITZERLAND (79%)",1720 words,CORRUPTION (97%); PENSION FUNDS (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); SCANDALS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); TRENDS (74%); ETHNICITY (73%); OIL & GAS INDUSTRY (73%); DEVELOPMENT BANKS (73%); ENERGY MARKETS (68%); POLICE FORCES (68%); GOLD & FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES (67%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (50%),"By PETER CLAVER OPARAH Last week, Transparency International, the global anti-corruption watchdog released its ranking of world corruption index among countries. Nigeria was ranked the 25th most corrupt nation on earth. This was a drop from the 27th position it occupied at the last ranking. To most Nigerians who are living witnesses and victims to the pervasive culture of corruption which has, under the Jonathan regime, been elevated to directive principle of state policy, this was a conservative rating and a flattering of a system that now rests solely on corruption. It is trite saying that corruption has completely overwhelmed the country as no day passes without stories of mind boggling corruption reported in all the sectors of the country's governance. From the over N2 trillion fuel subsidy scandal to the looting of the pension fund, from the purloining of the police pension fund to the financial fraud going on in all federal ministries and parastatals, from the gargantuan oil theft scandal, which according to government officials, poses serious threat to the nation's economy to the sordid details of the cleansing going on in the ant-infested oil industry, from the revelation that N500 billion had been stolen from the ludicrous SURE-P fund to the disclosure by the Customs Director General that the country lost a whopping N603 billion to abuse of import waivers between January and September this year, from the Aviation scandal otherwise known as Oduahgate to the now trending allegation of massive stealing of kerosene subsidy, from the looting of the excess crude account to the emptying of the foreign reserves, it is one long and endless story of bizarre stealing, looting and corruption, which has come to define the face of the Jonathan government. The audacious plundering has retched up a new breed of novou riche Nigerians, most with no known means of livelihood and some with well known criminal history. These have moved in to buy private jets, acquire massive landed properties and veered off into the new fad, which is ownership of universities. Conversely, Nigerians pass through the worst form of deprivation in the history of the county as life hovers on the barest of levels. The level of want in Nigeria is best captured by a recent World Bank report, which states that about 130 million Nigerians live below two dollars a day! This is an incriminating report for a country that had been harvesting unflagging oil boom for the past fourteen years the PDP has been in power. Strange enough, President Goodluck Jonathan, assailed on all fronts by wide scale criticism of his tolerant attitude to corruption, told Nigerians that our greatest problem is not corruption but ethnicity. Even recently, an anti corruption group in Switzerland, Berne Declaration revealed that the NNPC and a group of Nigerian and international oil traders dupe the country in the sale of Nigerian oil. The group revealed that Nigeria was short changed of over $6.8 billion between 2009 and 2011! One would have expected the overwhelming reports of wholesome looting of the country's resources to overstretch an anti corruption agency like the EFCC. One would have expected the prison walls to be overstretched by the number of culprits held in respect of these criminal plundering. But not for the present EFCC. No one has been arrested, least of all prosecuted for these mind boggling acts of economic crime. No one is questioned, except when Nigerians rose up with heightened anger to protest the decision of the Jonathan government to pass the cost of the fuel subsidy scam on Nigerians through increased prices of petroleum products. Jolted by the massive outpouring of Nigerians against such effort, the EFCC said it was going to take in and prosecute the fuel subsidy thieves. It moved in to pick one or two of them and these were quickly released and there the story ended. Of course Nigerians still pay for the prodigality of these thieves through high prices of petroleum products. They were merely rattled and left to continue plying their trade in a mock trial aimed to deceive the long suffering Nigerians. Of the other cases of monumental corruption listed above, the EFCC has not even betrayed any whimper of knowledge, talk not of arresting any person to answer for these infractions. And the sordid plundering continues in reckless and more audacious impunity. Last week, Imo State governor, Owelle Rochas Okorocha was to raise an alarm of what he called unrelenting EFCC harassment of the officials of his government. To those conversant with happenings and politics of Imo State, this alarm was long in coming as the EFCC seems to have relocated to Imo State for the sole purpose of harassing, intimidating and distracting the purposeful government in Imo State so as to make the state pliant for the return of the rapacious PDP whose 12 years tenure in Imo governance left the state despoiled, traumatized and prostrate. It is this disheveled story that the Rochas government has boldly been addressing since 2011 when he wrestled the entire armada of the PDP to get to power. Since then, neither the PDP hierarchy, the Jonathan government nor the dislodged mandarins who ate down the state in twelve years have rested in trying to re-launch the good old days of wanton free loading. The PDP, which has been pining and ruing the loss of the feel good days is being commissioned by the presidency, eager to boost its sagging flanks, to launch a warfare in Imo State and the EFCC is the arrowhead of the war. That was the message Okorocha was sending when he raised the alarm and discernible Imo citizens know this fact. They know that EFCC has made it a duty to make ceaseless rounds in Imo State, arresting officials at will based on the many specious and outlandish petitions the moths and rodents that people the state PDP generate against the state government. Imo State for the nearly three years Okorocha has been in power, has been one of the laudable stories of recovery from the waste laying between 1999 and 2011. All sectors have been targeted in a massive effort to recover the years eaten away by the locusts and the state has picked up its pieces from where Mbakwe left it. 305 brand new model schools are being built all over the state, state pupils in primary, secondary and state owned tertiary institutions are enjoying a historical free education replete with other accompanying accoutrements, all the decayed roads, streets in Owerri, Orlu and Okigwe have been recovered, rebuilt and remodeled while fifteen kilometers of rural roads have been constructed in each of the 27 local councils in the state. Twenty seven modern hospitals are being built in the 27 local councils in the state while all the colonial relics and kitchen lines that formed the face of government buildings for the period the PDP renters wrecked the state, have all given way to modern edifices and structures that compliment a modern civil service. Employment and jobs are being created and filled in through the community councils that targets even and effective distribution of resources to all the communities in the state. These are few of the land breaking features of governance which never existed in Imo for the twelve years the PDP, through such amorphous groups like apex leaders, stakeholders, god fathers, etc despoiled and Œæ ate down the state. The Imo state chapter of the PDP and its national hierarchy are not pleased with the good fortunes of Imo people and that is why they have sworn to ensure that Governor Okorocha does not nick a re-election. It does not matter if they have nothing, just nothing, to advertise as their achievement in power for twelve years while Okorocha has a bountiful harvest to show for his brief tenure at Douglas House. They now live in forging frivolous petitions against the regime and trusting the EFCC which has become the political hatchet dog of the PDP to launch an unending war against the Imo government. They freely boast of this even when they have pending questions of what they did with the twelve years allocation of Imo State still shoveled under EFCC's bulging carpet. They believe that by 2014, when Governor Okorocha would be standing for re-election, they would have mutilated his achievements and soften the ground for their comeback but they are gravely mistaken for Okorocha is etching his achievements in indelible imprimatur and in the minds of the ordinary Imo man and this will defy the erasing capacity of the minions in PDP. It is instructive that the funding for these nefarious operations in Imo State is from the well heads of corruption that has been opened in the present government, as reported above and which should form the primary business of an EFCC concerned about the culture of corruption that is ravaging the country at present. I am not against directing the klieglight on those in power and this should be made clear. I however believe that such klieglight should be on real and provable cases of economic crimes-the type being perpetrated under the nose of the EFCC by the federal government, which is threatening to bury Nigeria at present. Since the EFCC started its self-deceitful fancy ride round Imo, it is yet to publish any worthwhile report that indicts any Imo government official and it has not brought any official to prosecution, yet it won't stop and attend to the overwhelming evidences of corruption that mire the PDP federal government because it is a mere hatchet in the hands of PDP. Running rings in Imo where evidence of prudent management of state resources is even obvious in the sheer volume and impact of projects that have been undertaken these past two and half years, is like searching for needle in a haystack. Nigeria is being run aground by corruption and the EFCC knows this. It is rather preoccupied with chasing rats all round Owerri in deference to the consuming narrow interests of the present PDP government while Nigeria crumbles. We wish them luck but they should remember that whenever the history of the sordid present is compiled, they should expect to be rightly captured on what they did to encourage the rot of the present.

On the surface, it may appear that the Speaker was harsh in his observations, considering his status in the society and the channel of communication. But the message cannot be wholly dismissed. Many Nigerians believe that there is no executive commitment to combating corruption as it does things that are antithetical to the cause. It appears as if government is paying lip service to the confrontation against corruption. There is nothing to confirm the seriousness of the government on this matter as most allegations are either swept under the carpet or simply politicised without any tangible outcome. In the process, corruption has become endemic and institutionalised in all facets of our national life. In buttressing this dimension, Tambuwal mentioned the oil subsidy andŒæSecurity and Exchange Commission scandals, the pension scam as well as the Aviation Minister's bullet-proof automobiles scandal, all of which did not attract serious presidential condemnation or action. From all indications, the issue of corruption and the battle against it are not exclusive to the presidency. The problem has become so pervasive that no sector of our national life is free from blame. Even the legislative chamber presided over by Tambuwal has its share of blame as some of its members had been indicted for corruption and the profiles of their cases remain hazy or at best entangled in protracted legalism. Anti-corruption agencies, particularly the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission,Œæhave not lived up to expectation, thus leaving their flanks open to public opprobrium. The judiciary, too, has failed in its onerous responsibility of adjudicating filed cases of corruption in a timely manner as the cases linger on interminably. Even when rulings are given, they sometimes ridicule justice administration. Preposterous judgments that allow indicted people to literally walk away with their loot after refund of a part of their ill-gotten wealth in the name of plea bargain mock the essence of justice. Judicial officers blame the absurd rulings on the outdated provisions of our antediluvian law, which, they insist, need to be reviewed-not just amended. If the statutes remain the way they are, criminality and corruption will continue to flourish in the country. Yet, there are no serious efforts to review these laws. In fighting corruption, all hands must be on deck. It should not be left to the government alone. There are variants and dimensions of corruption, which must be understood by one and all if we are to make progress in this sphere. Corruption encompasses stealing, angling for positions, nepotism, electoral irregularities, justice delay-the list goes on and on. Efforts must therefore be galvanised by all and sundry to root out or reduce the hydra-headed monster called corruption before it consumes the nation.

The group said that, ""promises alone can't end corruption and impunity of perpetrators. ""Taking these simple actions will immediately send a clear message that as far as the fight against corruption is concerned, it won't be business as usual in 2014,"" the organization stated. In the document released today and signed by SERAP's Executive Director, Adetokunbo Mumuni, the organisation said that, ""the level of corruption in the country today demands serious political will to combat and not rhetorical statements.Œæ We recall that similar promises have been made by this government since its inception. Yet, corruption continues daily and most worryingly, suspected perpetrators enjoy almost absolute impunity. ""In order to end this never-ending cycle of broken promises, SERAP is recommending to the government an easy-to-implement 5-point programme against corruption for urgent action. SERAP believes that the effective implementation of these measures will prove if the government is genuinely serious about fighting corruption.Œæ Firstly, the president should demonstrate his total rejection of corruption by publicly declaring his assets and instructing all members of his government to do the same."" According to the group, ""this is the best way the President is ever going to earn the trust of millions of Nigerians yearning for good governance, development and the rule of law. ""Secondly, President Jonathan should urgently refer unresolved cases of corruption including that in the aviation, oil subsidy scandal, alleged mismanagement of trillions of naira by the Security The organisation said that, ""this is the surest way for the President to fulfil his 2011 promise to Nigerians in the presence of 50 heads of state that he would 'fight corruption regardless of the position of the person involved.' Otherwise, the fight against corruption will mean little if those close to the seat of power are constantly shielded from prosecution for corruption."" ""Thirdly, President Jonathan should publicly reassure Nigerians that he will cut-down unnecessary and wasteful expenses such as the N1.6billion for a new jet;Œæ N34.5million for two animals for the Presidential Villa Zoo; N2.4billion forŒæ foreign and local trips; N362million for meals and refreshment and N834million for fueling generating sets inŒæ the Presidency and theŒæ MDAs.

""Fourthly, President Jonathan should urgently address allegations of corruption in the privatisation of electricity, which is now denying the citizens access to regular electricity supply. The matter should be urgently referred to appropriate anti corruption agencies for action. ""Finally, President Jonathan should lead the process to domesticate and effectively implement the UN Convention against Corruption within the legal system.

Making the promise during his New Year message to the nation, he affirmedŒæŒæ the belief of his administration that the cost of governance in the country was still too high and had to be further reduced. He also promised that his government would take additional steps to stem the tide of corruption and leakages.  The president explained that already, his government has worked hard to curb fraud in the administration of the pension system and the implementation of the petroleum subsidy scheme. He also assured that the prosecution of those involved in pension fund scam would continue while the petroleum subsidy scheme is currently being operated under new strict guidelines to tackle previous leakages and prevent fraud. Another innovation in the president's planned war against graft is the curtailment of foreign travels that would apply to all Federal Government's Ministries, Departments and Agencies. Government, the president further pointed out, would also rely on the use of appropriate technologies including biometrics and digitizing of payment system to curb fund leakages. We recall that late last year, Jonathan bemoaned the increasing incidence of corruption in both the public and private sectors in spite of institutional reforms put in place to check it. He then claimed that the leadership of the two major anti-graft agencies, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) had been repositioned to fight corruption in all its ramifications. Despite these presidential assurances, corruption in Nigeria, especially among political office holders, has flourished even more. It appears that official corruption has been elevated to a level that it is fast becoming the norm instead of a vice. Corruption is denying many Nigerians the long-expected dividends of democracy. It explains why governance is not working generally in the country and why public infrastructure do not last. Recently, the leadership of EFCC claimed that it has no funds to fight corruption. There is no doubt that the fight against corruption has taken a nosedive under this administration. Apart from the fact that no notable political actor has been convicted of corruption by the agency, there is nothing on the ground to show that the government is keen to fight corruption in the country. Now that Jonathan has vowed to fight corruption this year, he should live up to his promise this time. The president must live by example in the fight against graft. He should be in the forefront of the war against corruption along with his ministers and other political appointees. One of the major allegations contained in the former president, Olusegun Obasanjo's recent letter to Jonathan, is the high level of corruption in governance, especially in the oil sector under the watch of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). Jonathan should seriously work against the prevalent and endemic corruption now crippling governance and the economy of the country. While the president should fight corruption at the federal level, it is expected that the governors would lead the fight against the menace at the state and local government levels. The corruption at these levels of government contributes largely to the prevailing graft in the land. The legislature, at state and federal levels, should join in the fight against corruption. Allegations of corruption in some of these legislative Houses do not aid the fight against corruption. The judiciary should also be in the forefront of the war against graft by ensuring that all such cases are expeditiously adjudicated. TheŒæŒæ use of plea bargains, which allows wealthy Nigerians to get laughable sentences for monumental corruption, is not the best way to fight this crime. There is the need to convict corrupt high profile individuals to sound a warning that the war against graft is really on. The battle against the problem needs holistic and systematic approaches to be won. It is time Nigerians said no to corruption at all levels of governance. We all need to join in the crusade to rid the country of corruption by playing the role of whistleblowers. The anti-graft agencies should demonstrate the strong will required to fight this battle. The president should adequately equip and reposition the anti-graft agencies to fight corruption. For the war to make a significant impact, it must go beyond occasional rhetoric from the president."358,The Sun (Nigeria),2/26/2014,"Amaechi tackles Jonathan on oil theft, corruption",,NIGERIA (99%); UNITED KINGDOM (93%); AFRICA (92%); UNITED STATES (79%),1228,Newspaper,Our Reporter,ENGLISH,,26-Feb-14,"ABUJA, NIGERIA (94%)",685 words,GOVERNORS (91%); CORRUPTION (90%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%); LARCENY & THEFT (90%); HELICOPTERS (89%); BANKING & FINANCE (89%); SURVEILLANCE & RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT (88%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (78%); BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (74%); PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (72%); FORENSICS (64%); OIL & GAS INDUSTRY (62%); CENTRAL BANKS (60%),"FROM CHRIS ANUCHA, Port Harcourt and TAIWO AMODU, Abuja Rivers State Governor and Chairman of the Nigeria Governors' Forum (NGF), Chibuike AmaechiŒæ has said the Federal Government, under President Goodluck Jonathan is not serious about fighting oil theft and funds diversion in the country. He made the allegation yesterday in Port Harcourt when the British Minister for Africa and member of Parliament, Mark Simmonds, visited him in Government House. The governor said if the president was serious about fighting oil theft in the country, the Federal Government would not have refused the entry of two surveillance helicopters his government purchased two years ago into the country. He recalled how his administration procured two surveillance helicopters that would have assisted the Federal Government to fight oil theft, but expressed disappointment over the inability of the government to ensure its arrival to the state. He said: ""I don't know how much you have seen about oil theft, and I don't know if the Federal Government is serious about combating oil theft. Why I said this is that for two years now, the Federal Government has refused entry into the country, two surveillance helicopters paid for by the Rivers State Government. ""I suspect the refusal may be for political reasons... The helicopters have been packed in America for two years now, and the Rivers State Government is paying demurrage on them... But, if you see how much oil we are losing, we hear it is about $7 billion annually, then you will see that we need the helicopters."" Earlier, the British Minister for Africa and Member of Parliament, Marx Simmonds, said he was in Rivers State to see the United Kingdom investments, and to also participate in Nigeria's centenary celebration holding in Abuja, the nation's capital. Meanwhile, Governor Amaechi has condemned the suspension of governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Malam Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, saying it is a breach of the constitution. The NGF at the end of its meeting heldŒæ in Abuja from Monday night till Tuesday morning, Œæ declared in a communique that the suspension of governor of the apex bank was in clear breach of the Nigerian constitution and the CBN Act 2007. The governors alleged that the action of the Federal Government was aimed at divertingŒæ attention from the current national discourse on the missing $20 billion from Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) account, allegations of corruption and questionable accountability. The forum however backed the call of the Minister of Finance and the Senate Committee on Finance for a forensic audit of NNPC account. Also, the forum reiterated its concern about alleged refusal of the Presidency to convene the National Economic Council meeting for seven months. ""This has emasculated the constitutional opportunity to discuss the perilous state of the Nigerian economy thus plunging the nation into economic and political crises,"" it stated. On the pending litigation instituted by the NGF, challenging Federal Government's unilateral withdrawal from the federation account without recourse to states, the forum appealed to the judiciary, particularly the Supreme Court to accelerate the hearing on the constitutional cases, especially the case of the excess crude account and the illegal deductions. The Forum, in the communique, also expressed concerns on the state of killing in the North-East. ""We commend the military and other security agencies in their efforts to quell this. However, we expect the Federal Government should wake up to its responsibility of protecting lives and property in the country,"" the forum stated. It also condemned alleged plot to impeach the Nasarawa State governor."359,The Sun (Nigeria),4/10/2014,Corruption: Nigeria summons Zimbabwean envoy over Mugagbe's comments,,NIGERIA (99%); ZIMBABWE (95%); SOUTH AFRICA (93%); AFRICA (79%); SOUTHERN AFRICA (68%),1228,Newspaper,Our Reporter,ENGLISH,,10-Apr-14,"ABUJA, NIGERIA (91%); HARARE, ZIMBABWE (79%)",549 words,STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); RACISM & XENOPHOBIA (89%); RACE & RACISM (63%),"(ABUJA) The Federal GovernmentŒæon Thursday summoned the Zimbabwean Head of Chancery over remarks credited to President Robert Mugabe, which depicted Nigerians as very corrupt people.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Zimbabwean Head of Chancery, Stanley Kunjeku,Œæin Abuja to formally lodge a protest. The Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Dr Martin Uhomoibhi, described Mugabe's comment as ""vitriolic and denigrating on Nigeria and Nigerians."" ""We were very concerned when we read that on the occasion of the 90th birthday of President Mugabe, he took off considerable time to vituperate about Nigeria. He said Mugabe's comments reflected ""what we consider to be a strong aversion of our country, remarks which we consider denigrating and un-statesmanly on Nigeria and Nigerians in general."" ""He was reported to have said Nigerians are corrupt people when he hosted service chiefs on his 90th birthday. ""We want to present the strongest protest in that statement; not only does it not reflect the reality in our country, but to come from a sitting president of a brotherly country is most unkind and very dishonourable,"" he said. Uhomoibhi said the Zimbabwean president's comment was unfortunate, given the role played by Nigeria in the liberation struggle in southern Africa. He said Nigeria had always stood with Zimbabwe ""shoulder to shoulder"" since independence and was one of the first countries to congratulate Mugabe on his re-election. ""At the point sanctions were imposed on your country, Nigeria empathized with Zimbabwe,"" he said. Later, the Permanent Secretary told newsmenŒæthat Nigeria's reaction to the comment was not belated, given thatŒæit had been in the public domain since March 15. ""In our diplomatic parlance, we do not react the way people would want us to react; we have to verify and articulate our position,"" he said. In his response, Kunjeku said Nigeria's protest would be forwarded to Harare. Meanwhile, Uhomoibhi has condemned the reported attacks on Nigerians in South Africa last week. ""We condemn in strong terms, any acts of racism, xenophobia and discrimination perpetrated by whomsoever, including in that particular country. ""We are appalled that these incidents occur from a country that we hold in highest esteem and which is a brotherly country to Nigeria. ""We hope that due processes would be taken so that this does not happen (again)."" The Permanent Secretary also called on the South African Government to take appropriate actions against those responsible for the attacks. He urged South Africa to abide by its commitment to international standards of behaviour and cordial relations between both countries. It will be recalled that onŒæApril 2 andŒæ3, some Nigerians wereŒæhospitalized in Pretoria after attacks by organized gangs in South Africa.

A Milan prosecutor is probing the role of Claudio Descalzi, Eni's chief executive officer (CEO), his predecessor Italian oil and gas major Eni, the parent company of Nigeria Agip Oil Company, is being probed over suspected corruption linked to the acquisition of Oil Prospecting Licence (OPL) 245 in Nigeria for over a billion dollars. A Milan prosecutor is probing the role of Claudio Descalzi, Eni's chief executive officer (CEO), his predecessor and another Eni executives over their role in the Italian group's acquisition, in partnership with Shell, of the rights to OPL 245. The prosecutors recently opened a probe into alleged corruption relating to the acquisition of the offshore oil block in 2011 by Eni and Shell. Last year, British police began investigating a money-laundering allegation in connection with the same field. Eni has however denied that there was illegal conduct on the acquisition of the oil block, highlighting that it entered into agreements for the acquisition of the block only with the government of Nigeria and Shell. ""The entire payment for the issuance of the license to Eni and Shell was made uniquely to the Nigerian government,"" said Eni in a statement on Thursday. The company notes that according to documents received on Wednesday as part of a foreign procedure ordering the seizure of a third party's bank account, following a request by the Prosecutor of Milan, Eni's chief executive officer and chief development, operations and technology officer are under preliminary investigation by the Milan prosecutor's office. ""Eni is cooperating with the Milan prosecutor's office, and is confident that the correctness of its actions will emerge during the course of the investigation,"" Eni said. When the block was acquired, the Nigerian government said it was helping to resolve an ownership dispute over the block between Shell and Malabu Oil and Gas. Under the deal, Eni made a payment to the Nigerian government of $1.09 billion ([#x20ac]844,000) to secure joint ownership of the block along with Shell, which had previously taken a 40 percent stake and had begun to develop the field. Most of the money Eni paid was subsequently passed on to Malabu Oil and Gas, a company believed to be owned by Dan Etete, a former Nigerian oil minister. The block, which has been estimated to contain as much as nine billion barrels of crude oil, is considered the biggest and richest oil well in the country. No sooner had word gone out that its CEO Claudio Descalzi was under investigation for alleged corruption in Nigeria, than Eni shares fell more than by one percent in early afternoon trading on Thursday, in an otherwise broadly flat market. Descalzi, who was appointed CEO of Eni in May, is under investigation for his role in a $1.1 billion acquisition of the oil block. He was head of the group's exploration and production (E&P) unit at the time of the deal. No commercial agreement was reached by Eni with Malabu Oil and Gas that previously owned the block in question, according to Eni. The company said its executives were being probed after a British court on Tuesday accepted the Milan prosecutor's request to freeze two bank accounts. According to Italian daily Corriere della Sera, these were Anglo-Swiss accounts containing a total of $190 million in the name of Emeka Obi, a suspected intermediary in the OPL 245 deal. Corriere said the court had accepted the prosecutor's argument that there was reason to believe the money may have been paid as part of an attempt to corrupt public officials. Last year, Obi sued Malabu via Britain's High Court and won an order that the company pay him $110 million in unpaid fees related to the deal which brought Eni into OPL 245. Descalzi is suspected by prosecutors of playing a role in the corruption of Nigerian politicians and bureaucrats, Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera reported on Thursday. The OPL 245 deal has come under scrutiny in the Nigerian parliament for the role played by Dan Etete, a former oil minister. Etete was said to have awarded the rights to the block to Malabu Oil and Gas in 1998, at a time when he was close to Nigeria's then-military dictator General Sani Abacha. In February this year, the House of Representatives called for the outright cancellation of the award of OPL 245 to Shell and Agip for identified flaws in the resolution agreement among Malabu Oil and Gas, Shell and Agip with the federal government acting as obligor. The legislators, in the report of the ad hoc committee that investigated OPL 245 Malabu deal, also directed the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to prosecute all individuals and financial institutions linked with and found culpable of receiving and transferring unlawfully with respect to the deal. Malabu Oil and Gas had sued the House of Representatives over its decision to cancel the sale of the OPL 245 oil block, asking the court to declare null and void, the resolution of the House on the oil block. The Senate Committee on Petroleum Resources (Upstream) also summoned Mohammed Adoke, Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, and others allegedly involved in the deal to a meeting on January 29, 2014 over the issue but the minister did not attend. He later reportedly informed the committee, through a letter personally signed by him and dated 27th February, that he stayed away because he had been earlier scheduled to attend a meeting in Addis Ababa, informing the committee to steer clear of the probe then because a group, African Youth Platform for Development, had instituted a suit in which the National Assembly and the Attorney-General were sued as first and second defendants. Nigeria reportedly lost about $10 billion in revenue which should have accrued to the country from mergers and acquisitions (M&A) by international oil companies over 10 years ago. A report of an investigation by the Committees on Justice and Finance of the House of Representatives revealed how oil companies manoeuvred their way and avoided payments of fees they were under obligation to pay and that Nigerian officials were willing collaborators as they failed to make demands from these companies monies due to the country.

Not only does she speak the truth as she sees it, she is also convincing when explaining her position on issues. In this interview with KEMI YESUFU, she speaks on the recently concluded National Delegates Conference during which she advocated death penalty for corrupt government officials. Anenih equally spoke on how money politics and women's lukewarm attitude to female aspirants robbed her of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ticket for last year's governorship election in Anambra State. She talked about the incident that led to her long years of gender activism, even as she disclosed why she has adopted an all-white dress code. As a delegate, are you satisfied with the outcome of the recently concluded national conference? Did the conference meet your expectations? For me, the conference was an eye opener. I didn't really have spelt out expectations. But I definitely knew that delegates will come with their positions and they would also expect to canvass these positions vigorously. As a person, I prayed and advocated that despite the differing positions, people would also be open minded enough not to take positions that will make it difficult for us to dialogue. I also hoped that people would be open enough for us to look at ourselves honestly and discuss our fears about each other. There is no doubt that in Nigeria people have profiled others. Some of the profiles are based on personal experiences, some were based on real and unreal assumptions and some have right and wrong perceptions. But these perceptions, most of which cannot survive close scrutiny have been affecting the way we live as a people. For me, the national conference came at the right time when we are celebrating Nigeria's centenary in order for us to deal with the fundamental issues. Also, for a president with months to election to convey a national conference, many thought he made a mistake. But I think he is courageous and he showed that he is a statesman. People were speculating that the conference would lead to the disintegration of the country. Some were so afraid they advised that we continue patching up until after the president returns to power. But the president showed that he really wants to transform the country by going ahead with the conference. We cannot deny the fact that the way we have been running the country by sweeping things under the carpet has got us nowhere. We just couldn't continue with the way things are. Due to the fears that surrounded the confab, we knew that we had to tread with caution. But as we went along, even in the first month, everybody realised that there is no reason for all the suspicion. We realised that by arguing over many things, we would not solve the problems of the country. It was clear that we never wanted to see a day that the geographical space called Nigeria will stop existing. We all wanted one Nigeria, no part of the country wanted to leave Nigeria. Mind you, the president also said the only thing we couldn't discuss is the dissolution of Nigeria. We looked at all the sectors and governance in general. At the end of the day, we had consensus on all the recommendations that were made. Talking about recommendations, Nigerians would really like to see that they are implemented. How can government make these recommendations a reality? There are some recommendations that have to do with policies. There are some that require constitutional amendment. All of these recommendations have been sorted accordingly and they have been presented to the president. The president has brought to reality his promise to set up a committee to work on our recommendations. I expect the committee to come out with a White Paper, this will now be the document on which the issues agreed on during the confab will be made a reality. I have confidence that when the White Paper is issued, the president won't allow it gather dust in the office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation. Nigerians shouldn't be worried about what becomes of the issues agreed on at the confab. We did a fantastic job and what Nigerians need to do is to keep the discussions on recommendations alive in order for government to implement them. As a former Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development, are you happy with the resolutions related to gender parity and the welfare of special groups such as persons living with disabilities as well as orphaned and vulnerable children? To start with, I commend the president for his gender sensitive stand. This is the first time that we recorded this number of female delegates at a national conference or anything of this sort. We had 92 women out of 400 delegates. In the categories of those nominated by the president, there was a category for market women, there was a category for the National Council of Women Societies (NCWS), FIDA was also represented and the National Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ) was represented. States were told to nominate at least one woman as part of the delegates they could send. There were female delegates from the civil society. We have never had it so good. In fact, it was only political parties that didn't send women. And when the women arrived at the conference, they showed that they were born activists. For every committee at the conference, the role of the female delegates was to make sure that recommendations coming from these committees were gender sensitive. In other words, gender was a factor in all the committees and not only in the social sector committee which I headed and where we had a section on gender. Be it in transport, agriculture or immigration, women made sure that gender was mainstreamed in their recommendations. At the end of the day, we had committees calling for 35 or 30 per cent representation in these sectors. For all of these, I will say that the female delegates did a good job. During the confab, we lost an extra-ordinary woman in the person of Professor Dora Akunyili. You actively participated in her burial. What does her loss mean to you and Nigerian women as a whole? Her death was a huge loss to us all. She was vibrant. She was energetic till the end. Even when she appeared at the confab sick, she was still energetic. She was hardworking and was ready to work for her country even when she was battling an illness. As she said, she was ready to serve Nigeria with the last drop of her blood. We will miss her a great deal. My prayer is that Nigerian women will emulate her as she had impacted on us through her exemplary life. We pray that we have more women like Dora Akunyili, as she was a woman of integrity and valour. Earlier you said the women at the confab were born activists. You have been involved in gender activism for a long time. How do you feel being called a born activist? Yes, I am a born activist. I have been advocating for women's rights before I became a well known politician. Even as a child I knew that I had rights as a woman. I didn't allow anyone make me feel any inferior. Was there anything that triggered your interest in activism? My mother had four daughters in succession. You can imagine how she felt delivering girl after girl. There were snide remarks from neighbours and family members. The names of my siblings also showed how my parents felt. We had a name like Obumneke, meaning 'am I the creator?' When the boy came, he was named Tagbo, meaning 'today is not too late'. But my father was unique for his time in the sense that he didn't allow the situation make him love his daughters any less. He gave us names like Ifeayinwa, meaning that 'there is nothing better than a child'. He kept telling me there is nothing I cannot achieve if I put my mind to it. He told me to be the best I can be in order to show the men that women are capable of doing great things. Unfortunately, I lost my father in my early teens and I saw the wickedness that was meted out to my mother as a widow in Ibo land. And I vowed that no man would do same to me. Even as a young girl, I decided that I would fight against harmful practices as well as wicked customs and practices women are put through. I also have to say that activism runs in my blood as my mother even as a widow had decided on the rites she would perform and those she wouldn't accede to because they were harmful. She was a fighter too. I remember in those days, she became the rallying point for widows in my community. So, I am naturally a born activist for women rights and the causes that promote a better life for women. Would you say that the women who occupied important public offices have proved their mettle? Also, a lot of people have expressed worry that women who were once taught to be less disposed to corruption are being accused of behaving like the men. Are you worried that women like the former speaker Honourable Patricia Eteh and immediate past Minister of Aviation, Princess Stella Oduah had to leave office in controversial circumstances? I always tell women who want to come into public life, that they first have to develop a skin thicker than that of a crocodile. In fact, if they can add another layer of elephant skin to that of the crocodile, it will be good they do so. They equally need to guard their underbelly so that when those who come to attack them arrive, they won't be able to do anything. The truth is, many still see the female leader as 'ordinary woman' who shouldn't be seen or heard and because of this they will use everything in their armory to fight the woman. Who are the 'they' you say fight to bring down women in public office? Of course, I mean people in our society. The fact is, our society is still not ready to see an 'ordinary woman' in charge. They will love to see her pulled down. Once a woman has the top job, each day, they will work on pulling her down; looking for what she did and what she did not do. Because of this, a woman has to go into public office prepared. If not, they will destroy your spirit. You talked about the former speaker, this woman within the short while she was elected speaker had to contend with false allegations. But after everything, the same House of Representatives apologised to her (Eteh), saying that she was wrongly accused. Neutral observers knew she was innocent all along. But they had already stained the woman's name for nothing. Even with Stella Oduah, where have you read or heard that any transaction was done in her name? Was there anything bought in her name? No minister can serve for a hundred years, so even when there are cars bought for the use of a minister, he/ she knows the car remains the property of the ministry. But it is better to call for the crucifixion of Stella Oduah because she is a woman. However, the fact remains that she reformed the aviation sector in an unprecedented manner. And as I always like to say, at the end of the day, men and women are human beings and happenings have shown that men have higher propensity to deep their hands in the public till. So, isn't it a better deal to have women in public office? Unlike the men who have shown that when they deep their hands into the public purse, they take what's on top, the middle and the bottom of the purse. When do you think Nigeria will produce an elected female governor or even president? Today, we celebrate Ellen Johnson- Sirleaf of Liberia. Do you know who put her there? It is the women. She even got support from Nigerian women, because I still remember that I was in the delegation of the former First Lady, the late Mariam Babangida when she went to Monrovia for Sirleaf's swearing-in ceremony. As I said earlier, it is they-the people in the society, women inclusive, who can get a woman elected as governor or president here in Nigeria. Whether we have women who can rule this country, I will say yes. You talked about Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the late Dora Akunyili and even I, Josephine Anenih. But it all depends on what the society wants. When the society is ready to have a female governor or president, it will throw up a woman. Having said this, the critical work resides with the political parties. If the political parties are truly democratic and they will allow popular candidates emerge, then we may see more female governorship candidates and maybe a female presidential candidate. Another problem is the electorate, they seem to have lost hope of Nigeria ever making that quantum leap. They seem to have given up rather than seeing that every election is an opportunity for them to better their future. You will be surprised at the number of party people who will vote for the highest bidder. All they care about is getting in touch with the candidate that can pay. They are not interested in who has a better manifesto. They believe that no matter how good the promises of the aspirant sound, they will forget what they said once they are in office. Delegates just want to get all they can during the primaries and not worry themselves about what happens after elections. Lastly, I have to talk about what happens in our villages where women hardly have a say and they are mostly instructed on what to do, even when it comes to voting for a candidate. Could it be that what you just described was what took place when you sought your party's ticket? I can share my personal experience. When I contested for the PDP gubernatorial ticket, each ward produced three delegates and one of the three delegates were women. My calculation was that with 326 female delegates out of about 800 delegates, I could record a landslide win. I imagined that if the women would cast their votes based on who can govern the state effectively, I will be their candidate. They also should have supported me because I am a woman. But they didn't assess the aspirants based on the issues I mentioned. The women and other delegates based their considerations on ego (money). All they were asking was 'how much did they bring?' But as a former minister, you should have enough money to run for your party's primary? Honestly, I feel physical pain when I hear an educated person like you talk like you just did. My stomach turns when I hear enlightened people talk in the manner you just did. Is there any hope for Nigeria when an educated person sounds the way you did? So, if you haven't stolen money, you cannot function? I was minister for nine months. How much is my salary in nine months that you expect me to have millions to give people? Besides, I was minister four years ago. Sometimes, I feel like running away from this country because from the bottom to the top, all people want to hear is that you have money to give them. If we want ministers to commandeer the budget of their ministries and start dishing it out as their personal money, how can we run this country? How do we even deal with problems we have like insurgency? It's really sad because these days people are angry about almost everything. They want to take out their frustrations with the system on the next person. They were annoyed that I was a minister and I didn't have N150, 000 to give them like those they eventually voted for. This country is a cesspool of corruption and this is why we have people living below the poverty line in a blessed country like ours. But I still have hope that Nigeria will change. I am even more confident that things will change from what we were able to achieve at the confab. The change might be slow, but we will surely see a new Nigeria and I want to be one of those that will witness the new Nigeria. I don't want it to happen behind me. What kind of changes do you think we need? As I just said, I am even more emboldened in my belief of a new Nigeria since the success of the conference. I, like many Nigerians believe that if we implement the 600 recommendations reached at the confab, our country will change for the better. I have always been a supporter of the president, but my admiration for his leadership style has increased greatly with what the confab was able to achieve. I am rooting for a second term for Jonathan even more because of the far-reaching recommendations the confab has submitted to him. He made the confab happen despite all the advisers that asked him not to take such a risk with elections around the corner. Do you know that one of the recommendations of the confab is that anybody caught with his/her hands in the public purse should be jailed for life? I wanted us to borrow from China where corrupt officials are executed. But the majority said corrupt people should be imprisoned for life and all of their assets confiscated. We will have a new country if we can implement these recommendations. How do you spend your time outside gender activism and public service? I don't have any other thing I do other than talking about women and going to church. I go to church to pray for a better Nigeria. What else do you want me do? Do you want me to go to the disco? I have outgrown that many years ago. You seem to revere the Ibo culture so much as you like being addressed by your Iyom title? Yes, I like to promote my culture and tradition. A person's culture is her roots. Can a tree grow without roots? One of the reasons why we are having problems in Nigeria is that people have lost touch with culture and tradition. There is hardly any community or people without ethos or norms. But when you have people who don't have ethos they live by, you see the kind of decadence being witnessed in Nigeria. Is your love for tradition the reason zyou wear white most of the time? To an extent, you are correct in the sense that white signifies purity and peace in my culture.

What Amaechi said was already known in the public but it was his boldness in making that declaration openly that marked a major difference. Up until that admission, it was difficult to find any politician who would admit candidly that they enrich themselves through stealing of public money and other fraudulent practices. A politician will sit on billions of naira illegally acquired and will still throw his hands in the air declaring that he is as poor as a rat that resides in an empty warehouse. A weak civil society is not only evidence of a dead society, it is also proof that we are all complicit in the way politicians ransack the treasury unlawfully and boldly, making it look like they are entitled to dip their fingers into the nation's reserves. Amaechi said the citizens must scrutinise and hold political leaders to account. In statements aimed directly at civil society and President Goodluck Jonathan's government, Amaechi said in December 2013 at an occasion meant to honour Nelson Mandela: ""If you see a thief and you allow him to be stealing, what have you done? You have stoned nobody; that is why we are stealing. Who have you stoned?... A few individuals are going away with the money and you have done nothing. You are mourning Madiba, who lived up to 95, and he was very angry with Nigeria when he died."" The astonished audience could not believe that a member of the political class was not only criticising his peers but was also encouraging the public to take ownership of the country through civil disobedience or any other means possible. Amaechi continued: ""You've heard that $50bn is missing and you have done nothing about it. In some countries people will go on the street until they return that money. It is N8trn, it can change Nigeria. Me I want to steal only $1bn, let them bring it... If you don't take your destiny in your hands, we will go and other leaders will come and continue stealing."" It was a powerful but self-critical speech. Essentially, Amaechi made the point that if civil society remained apathetic to how politicians amassed wealth illegally, no one had the right to complain that the political was grossly corrupt and morally depraved. In the end, Amaechi's public address fell on deaf ears. That's what you can expect from a gutless civil society, a society that loves to live life to the fullest without sacrificing their lives. A country without an active and effective civil society is like a democratic country without opposition. Without a strong civil society, political leaders will abuse human rights with impunity. They will operate without financial prudence. By his political office, Amaechi should not expect civil society to regard him as a man without blemishes, particularly as his statements could be construed to be a kind of self-indictment. Certainly, he did not exclude himself from other members of the school of kleptomaniacs who believe they have the divine right to raid the treasury and acquire government property illegally. In his critique of the languid state of civil society in Nigeria, Amaechi outlined the serious consequences for the nation of a weak-willed civil society. If civil society fails to question people in authority and hold them to account, what you get is unbridled corruption. That was a true lecture but it should not have come from a man whose antecedents are tainted. In light of our experiences with political leaders, you could say that Amaechi's message was correct but the messenger has his own baggage to clear. It is the responsibility of civil society to insist that political leaders must perform. It is a question of responsible governance, about ridding political leaders of the culture of corruption that has reduced every official business to the brown envelope syndrome in which money is consistently demanded and paid for before any public official or political leader will perform their official duty. This is how we consecrate corruption. Part of the reason why politicians continue to treat the citizens with supreme contempt and regard the nation as their personal property is that no one wants to die for the good of society. People wonder why they would sacrifice their precious lives so that the rest of us can live and benefit from other people's sacrifices. It's a smart position to take but it is also the kind of argument that cowards are made of. In the land of lily-livered men and women, you will hear too many people criticise the nation's political leaders for their unparalleled corruption and uninspiring performance but no one will actually take the first step to commence non-stop non-violent protest, the kind that a poor man started in Tunisia in 2011, or the type that is currently unfolding in Hong Kong. We look at what is happening in other countries, how citizens have successfully challenged their political leaders, and we wish we could do the same in Nigeria. I am still hearing today the same angry complaints and yelling that I heard in my youth many years ago in regard toŒæ lack of transparency in government, corruption and embezzlement of public funds by military dictators, elected politicians, and senior public officials. If you replay in 30 years time your video recording of today's public expressions of anger, you will be surprised by how markedly similar things can be. Just last Saturday, 4 October 2014, businessman Arthur Eze described Nigerian politicians as morally bankrupt and selfish. He said ""our politicians do not care, they are criminals, and they are greedy"". There is nothing new in Eze's remarks. Everyone knows that politicians are conspicuously crooked and live exaggerated and deceitful lifestyle. The question is who will lead the campaign to change the situation? Reader's reaction Re: Dimgba Igwe: Looking for a killer in a haystackThe account of ""How Dimgba Igwe died - Eyewitness"" did not stop at stirring uncontrollable tears but left me wondering where Nigeria is gravitating towards. Which sector in this country can one beat his chest to vouch for as working? None. Dimgba Igwe's experience with three hospitals failing him has proved beyond reasonable doubt that most of our hospitals should adopt the appellation ""mortuary"" because the end point of every emergency case is death. In the 60s, hospitals were indeed what they were called. But the whole thing went bunkers when everything was politicized. Universities became producers of substandard graduates, on quota system, with qualified students losing their bona fide slots, on discriminatory scores to assuage deficient students in other states. What else could such produce other than doctors who lack requisite knowledge of medicine? Nigeria needs God's intervention to bail her out of ethnic sentiments which the country's political leaders are using for sectional satisfaction. Re: Honour to people who don't deserve it Kudos for doing proper justice on the above issue in your last write up. In fact, you succeeded in unburdening my age-long heavy mind about this abysmal show of shame being carried out yearly by our successive governments. In the course of serving my fatherland, I was involved in a ghastly automobile accident which kept me in various hospitals for about two years (1984-1986). I also participated in some military campaigns such as Operation Lion Heart (1987), Operation Liberty (1990-1991), and Operation Harmony (1999). Thereafter, I was honourably retired with nothing to show for my services of over 24years. Today, I have nothing to show for my meritorious services to my country but rather regrets and much agony. I deserve to be recognised and honoured by my country, no matter the criteria used for selection, even though I did not retire as a General.Œæ Elder (Major) C.R. Chinaka (rtd) Re: Honour to people who don't deserve it Your position on most of the people making the National Honours list is right but it has become an annual ritual because the practice is an adopted channel for compensating errand boys of political office holders. Whoever imagined that Dr. Stella Adadevoh who sacrificed her life to save Nigerians would not be honoured? Sad, very sad indeed! But what would anyone have expected from a corrupt leadership clime other than corrupt practices? Imagine the Nigerian who designed the national flag also not on the list for post-humous honour. What a show of shame by Nigerian government! Good Nigerians must keep calling on present and subsequent presidents and governments consistently, through whatever available channels, especially the media, to look into the issue with the hope of making a positive change.

The pledge is coming as Nigeria and other African countries continue to struggle against massive poverty attributable to public sector corruption. President of the World Bank Group, Jim Yong Kim, said in its latest annual report that corruption and anti-fraud interventions in the coming decade would need to rely on concerted international efforts, country leadership and a set of principles guiding solutions and initiatives. Kim said the World Bank Group support to country-led efforts was critical to turning the tide against corruption once and for all, adding that the group would provide tools that transform ideas into action, diffuse knowledge across the globe on what works and why, and help countries adopt successful strategies, adding that it would also help citizens hold their leaders accountable for making pledges to make governance more accountable. The World Bank had established an Integrity Office in 1999 to strengthen integrity function at the group leading to development of the unit into an Integrity Vice Presidency (INT) with mandate to prevent, deter and investigate fraud and corruption in bank-financed operations. As part of its strategic update, INT is looking into ways of spreading its impact more effectively across regions while incorporating prevention and compliance as critical elements of its response to clients. ""Our focus is on identifying alternative solutions to persistent anti-corruption challenges that can sustain collective action by our development partners and clients,"" said World Bank Group Integrity Vice President, Leonard McCarthy. During this fiscal year, INT's investigative results led to sanctioning of 71 firms and individuals for misconduct including corruption, collusion, fraud and/or coercive practices.Œæ As of the end of this fiscal year, the Integrity Compliance Office was actively engaged with 13 multinational companies. Preventive tools that were developed include the use of checklists for procurement staff to assist them in reviewing bids as well as changing project delivery models to allow for more diligent community oversight. INT is also investing in technology and data-driven solutions to help identify and stop fraud and corruption through reverse engineering of some of its cases. Engaging with members of the World Bank Group's International Corruption Hunters Alliance, a series of webinars was delivered this fiscal year to strengthen the capacity of heads of anti-corruption agencies, public prosecutors and attorneys general in financial crime detection and whistleblower protection.

A row has been brewing between Zambia and Dangote Cement, a major employer in Africa's second-largest copper producer, after the government minister made the allegations in September. Dangote said in papers filed in court that the minister had created an impression that the company was exploiting Zambian workers and enticing government officials with bribes. ""The plaintiff has been brought into public scandal and its reputation has been injured,"" Dangote said in a writ of summons dated Oct. 10. The dispute appears to be the latest in a string of incidents in which the southern African nation's government has resorted to strong-arm or unorthodox tactics against foreign investors it believes are circumventing labour laws. Dangote Industries Zambia (DIZ) has 400 workers building a $400 million cement plant, a staff count that should rise to 2,000 when production starts in November.

Speaking at the 19th Annual Conference of Certified National Accountants in Abuja, the president of the association, Alhaji Sakirudeen Tunji Labode, said that the issue of corruption had assumed an alarming dimension in the polity and that all Nigerians need increased and pragmatic effort to fight the menace that has hampered rapid economicŒæ development in the country over the years. He lamented that the cankerworm has made Nigeria lose several investment opportunities from the global business community.

He added that the association is a proponent of corruption-free society. Labode said on its own ANAN has a disciplinary mechanism for dealing with erring members in the association. ""The investigating panel established under the association's enabling law investigates complaints and issues bordering on professional misconduct of members and where it establishes a prima-facie case against a member, it refers same to the Disciplinary Tribunal of the association established by ANAN Act.

On conducive business environment, the ANAN president said for investment to thrive, it was imperative for the government to create a veritable environment, capable of wooing investors as well as assisting already existing businesses to flourish. In his keynote address, Board Chairman, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Dr Suleyman Ndanusa, observed that corruption remains one of the greatest challenges facing the Nigerian economy. He referred to the latest report of German-based Transparency International, which ranked Nigeria 33 most corrupt country in the world while the Corruption Perception Index 2013 ranked Nigeria 144 out of 177 nations in the world with 25 points. '""This year, Nigeria shared the podium of infamy with crisis-torn Central African Republic and neighbouring Cameroon.Œæ This result is alarming and the trend should not be allowed to continue,"" he stated, adding that the accountancy profession has contributed greatly to the growth of the economy. Ndanusa stated that for accountancy to play to its full potential, it had to play a major role in the fight against corruption in the country. Declaring the three day conference which has the theme: ""100 years of Governance and Accountability in Nigeria: Lessons from the Accountancy Profession"" open, President Goodluck Jonathan, who was represented by the Accountant General of the Federation, Mr. Jonah Ogunniyi Otunla, stated that despite all criticisms of contemporary governance, government is still the most powerful institution of society. The president stated that no matter how large or influential any individual, corporation or association may become, such entities must abide by the rules that are established and enforced by government. ""As a pivotal institution with such enormous responsibilities, therefore it is imperative for government to be right and founded on transparency, probity and accountability"" he said, noting that to create the desired synergy of actions aimed at improving the quality of lives of the citizenry through sustainable development these same virtues are demanded of other socio economic and professional institutions such as ANAN. However, following the dwindling resources occasioned by the low production of oil, the president urged the professionals to tackle the challenge of enhancing government revenue for better financing of annual budgets."370,The Sun (Nigeria),11/4/2014,Nigeria loses N776bn to corruption in fertilizer sector -Akinwumi,,NIGERIA (97%),1228,Newspaper,Our Reporter,ENGLISH,,4-Nov-14,"ABUJA, NIGERIA (92%)",688 words,FERTILIZERS (92%); AGRICULTURAL CHEMICALS (90%); CORRUPTION (89%); FERTILIZER MFG (89%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (78%); RICE FARMING (77%); AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES (76%); AGRICULTURE (76%); RURAL DEVELOPMENT (76%); BANKING & FINANCE (72%); AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS (71%); RETAILERS (64%); RICE MILLING (63%); BAKERIES (61%),"The Federal Government has said it lost over N776[#x200e] billion to corruption or an average of N26 billion annually in the seed and fertilizer sector between 1980 and 2010. Our Reporter:ŒæTHERESA EGBA, ABUJA The Federal Government has said it lost over N776[#x200e] billion to corruption or an average of N26 billion annually in the seed and fertilizer sector between 1980 and 2010. Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, said at a four-day Public Affairs Forum organised by the office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President (Public Affairs), Dr. Doyin Okupe, with the theme, ""The Jonathan Administration: Four Impactful Years,"" that over N873 billion ($5.4 billion) was spent on fertilizer subsidies[#x200e] of which not more than 11 per cent of farmers received the inputs. According to him, ""over N776 billion ($4.8 billion) was estimated to have been lost to corruption or an average of N26 billion (162.5mln) annually while the system displaced the private sector whileŒæ Nigerian farmers lost their dignity."" Adesina said the Agricultural Transformation Agenda was begun using a three-stage approach of treating agriculture as a business rather than as a social or developmental issue, using the value chain approach of adding value to everything produced in Nigeria and ensuring a paradigm shift to agriculture which is the engine growth of the economy. He said the Jonathan administration transformed the lives of farmers by ending 40 years corruption in the seed and fertilizer sector within 90 days through the Growth Enhancement Scheme (GES) of which 14 million farmers had benefitted from subsidised farm inputs, with 10.3 million of these beneficiaries (75 per cent) in northern Nigeria. Adesina stressed that as part of the success of the Jonathan administration, Fertilizer producers and inputs and retailers enjoyed a near 500 per cent boost in credit from financial institutions from $22 million to $125 million between 2012/2013, $5 billion investments in commitments in the fertilizer sector with $1.3 billion from Notore, $9 billion investment by Dangote Group and $1.2 billion by Indorama. Other achievements, he said, include the large scale mechanised farming [#x200e]underway on 5300 Ha in 10 states to ensure efficient production and the rice revolution in which Nigeria has recorded an additional seven million mts of Paddy rice since 2012, adding that the government was financing N13 billion acquisition of 10 integrated rice mills with capacity of 360,000 mts to reduce the rice milling gap. Other successes, he said, include the inclusion of 20 per cent cassava flour in the nation's wheat and confectionery processes particularly in over 30 major bakeries across Nigeria[#x200e], mechanisation of agriculture, empowerment of women farmers and very viable loan facilities through the creation of NIRSAL facilities. He said to facilitate cassava flour production the government had also facilitated the acquisition of six medium scale plants, private sector to set up seven medium scale plants while the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD) is training 5,000 master bakers in 2014 to effectively produce cassava bread at commercial scale with the N4.3 billion Cassava Bread Fund being managed by the Bank of Agriculture (BoA) and Bank of Industry (BOI) respectively. The Federal Government in August 2014 launched the nation's Agricultural Mechanisation Programme aimed at supporting farmers to take advantage of existing technologies to develop and expand their agriculture. This was effected with the launch of the AEHE, which is meant to provide agricultural mechanised services at subsidised rates. The Minister revealed that the full roll out of the programme would be implemented in stages. ""We have already started the process to establish the first set of 118 units of Agricultural Equipment Hiring Enterprises across the country. They will have 590 units of tractors, 500 power tillers and 500 harvest and post-harvest equipment. The bidding process by the private sector for these centres are being concluded this week and I expect most of the centers would be fully set."371,The Sun (Nigeria),11/4/2014,Jonathan has eradicated corruption in agric sector -Minister,,NIGERIA (94%); AFRICA (73%),1228,Newspaper,Our Reporter,ENGLISH,,3-Nov-14,"ABUJA, NIGERIA (94%)",414 words,FERTILIZERS (92%); AGRICULTURE (91%); AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); RURAL DEVELOPMENT (90%); AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY REGULATION (89%); AGRICULTURAL TRADE (89%); AGRICULTURAL CHEMICALS (78%),"Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dr. Akinwumi Adeshina, has said the administration of President Goodluck Jonathan has eradicated corruption in the agriculture sector.

Speaking yesterday in Abuja on the third day of the Public Affairs Forum organized by the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Public Affairs, the ministerŒæsaid the Agriculture Transformation Agenda of the Federal Government had restored sanity in the sector. He identified the eradication of the direct procurement and distribution of fertilizer by government officials as one giant stride of the present administration. Adeshina said: ""We ended 40 years of corruption in the fertilizer sector. The old system of government direct procurement and distribution of fertilizer was corrupt. Nearly 90 per cent of farmers never received subsidized fertilizers. ""Between 1980 and 2010, over N873 billion ($5.4 billion) was spent on fertilizer subsidies.

The minister also said with the incentives to stimulate mass production of cassava, the country could now boast of itsŒæ processing for export. Earlier, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Public Affairs, Doyin Okupe, said the programme was put together to showcase the achievements of the present administration. His words: ""Our intention is to showcase what this administration has been doing in the last three years.

In a statement, spokesman Eyinnaya Abaribe described the charges as ""spurious"" and ""preposterous."" A day earlier, Nigeria's former president Olusegun Obasanjo Obasanjo said at a public event that lawmakers were in the habit of blackmailing the executive into approving 'constituency projects.' which were never executed to swindle public fund. Abarib described the remarks as ""very unfortunate,"" being made by Obasanjo who ""initiated the idea of constituency projects during his reign as president between 1999 and 2007."" ""The allegation - as spurious as it was - is very distant from the truth and is nowhere near reality,"" Abribe said. ""The former president would not have tolerated such for the period he was the president of the country,"" he added. Abribe pointed out that Obasanjo was the initiator of the constituency project in the year 2000 as a means of ensuring that projects were fairly spread across Nigeria, using senatorial zones as the spring board. ""To ensure the execution of the projects, president Obasanjo again factored the constituency projects into the annual budgets to be implemented by the executive depending on the availability of funds,"" Abribe said. ""That is to say that no lawmaker ever comes close to the funds or even determine the contractor for the said projects or when the said contract would be awarded,"" he added. He added that it looked both ""curious"" and ""surprising"" that the former president would turn around after over ten years of initiating such projects to allege that the National Assembly was performing the function of both the executive and the legislature. Abribe said it was ""preposterous"" to claim that lawmakers awarded contracts ""to their agents to execute"" and expect the presidency under president Obasanjo or any other president to pay for what it is not part of. The parliament speaker also called Obasanjo's comments ""political"" and were meant to drag parliament into ""public odium"" only with the aim of scoring some political points.

Nigeria improve on the CPI from 144 in 2013 to 136 this year. He attributed the success to the clinical surgical incision made by President Jonathan at the centers of corruption in the country. ""The significant improvement Nigeria has made in the 2014 Corruption Perception Index released by Transparency International is as a result of the clinical surgical incision made by President Jonathan at the centers of corruption in Nigeria. You may recall that the Fertilizer Procurement and Distribution regime of the Agricultural sector used to be a cesspool of corruption. Billions of dollars were lost as middlemen inflated costs yet supplied subpar products to our farmers. But under the guidance of President Jonathan, 14 million farmers were registered by the Ministry of Agriculture and were connected directly to the product through the e-wallet system which allowed the ministry send texts to farmers to go and pick up their fertilizer and seeds direct from the depot. Nigeria has saved close to $2 Billion that would have gone into the pockets of corrupt officials and middlemen by this system. Also, I am sure Transparency International took into account the fact that this administration took the unprecedented step of auditing the workforce of the Federal Civil Service and in the process weeded out fifty thousand ghost workers saving Nigeria almost 350 billion Naira per annum. Due to the President's determination to punish this economic sabotage, those responsible have been forwarded to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, for prosecution to the highest extent of the law. It is also common knowledge that this administration has all but eliminated electoral fraud. Nigerians as well as Transparency International can attest to the fact that all elections held under the watch of Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, whether the 2011 General Elections, or the elections in Edo, Anambra, Ondo, Ekiti, Osun and Niger, have been free and fair and seen to be so by the International Community. These and other policies are the criteria that TI has used to bump Nigeria up in her ratings. He took a swipe at the opposition for doling out cash to their delegates in preparation to the party's primaries ""If it were up to the opposition, which is preparing for its primaries by doling out cash to their delegates and calling it welfare, Nigeria would have sunk further down in the CPI instead of our current improvement,"" he said. He added that the president will continue the fight against corruption. Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index 2014 ranks countries based on a 100-point ""corruption perception"" scale, where zero equals a ""highly corrupt"" perception and 100 means the country is perceived to be very clean. Nigeria ranked 136th, along with Russia, Lebanon, and Kyrgyzstan. In the report, North Korea and Somalia rank equal-worst of 174 countries with a score of just eight. Denmark and New Zealand ranked least corrupt, with scores of 92 and 91, respectively.

From IHEANACHO NWOSU, Abuja All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday made another scathing criticism of the administration of President Goodluck Jonathan, accusing it of taking corruption to a new height. National Chairman of the party, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun also said the masses had been subjected to untold hardship by the government as a result of the administration's alleged missteps and poor policies. He spoke with newsmen in Abuja dwelling on the state of corruption in the country, Odigie-Oyegun, who was flanked by former governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Segun Oni and National Publicity of APC, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, accused the government of consistently comprising all facets of the nation's life with corruption. He said the ranking of Nigeria at 139 of 176 in the corruption index by Transparency International (TI) had shown that the country was digging deeper into the cesspool of corruption. He said: ""The operation of the national budget and the maintenance of the military forces have been so severely compromised by corruption that national development and security have been massively undermined under the Jonathan administration of the last six years."" Although he admitted thatŒæthe country, since independence,Œæhad experienced varying degrees of corruption, Odigie-Oyegun contended that the worst dimension of the vice was being experienced under the incumbent administration. Taking the issue beyond the incumbent administration, the APC chairman stressed that all the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) administrations in the last 16 years were to blame for the spiralling corruption in the country. He said:Œæ""In spite of strong public disapproval of corruption, the cancer of corruption has continued to spread."" In the last 16 years, corruption has grown exponentially to the point that the world has come to stigmatize Nigeria and Nigerians as synonymous with corruption. ""Our national institutions have been compromised and the continued survival of the country is threatened. Using the corruption perception index (CPI) of Transparency International, Nigeria has maintained a score in the range of 25 per cent and ranked among the bottom level of corrupt countries, deteriorating from a bad score of 27 per cent in 2011 to 25 per cent in 2013.""

He said: ""Evidence of widespread and rampant corruption abound in our everyday life.Œæ Following the last public demonstration against the increase in fuel prices in 2012, a probe into the operations of the fuel subsidy programme of the Jonathan administration revealed massive fraud and corruption but this government has secured no conviction.

And the hype that usually follows such discoveries  naturally makes us confine our perception of corruption to stealing from the public treasury alone. By Sulaimon Alamutu Corruption in Nigeria is often measured in terms of how much a government official orŒæ politician has embezzled. And the hype that usually follows such discoveriesŒæ naturally makes us confine our perception of corruption to stealing from the public treasury alone. The days ofŒæ Mallam Nuhu Ribadu at the helm of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, actually threw up startling discoveries of how our leaders feasted with impunity on our commonwealth, which the media also gave adequate and extensive coverage. The likes of former IGP, Tafa Balogun, James Ibori, Sunday Afolabi, Lucky Igbinedion and a host of others made the headlines. This situation gave fillip to our already fixed notion that corruption is limited to those in the high places. And by extension, we measure the problem only in terms of financial misappropriation at the highest level of our society. But when we examine what goes on at the micro level, one discovers that this level appears to be the most infested with corruption and we most times ignore this fact.Œæ For the sake of argument, let's agree that corruption is only financial impropriety. What one sees in our ordinary daily interactions are clothed with corrupt practices in this regard. Take for instance, a chairman of a community development association conniving with some of his executive members to empty the treasury of the community. The financial status of the association is not rendered to the people for years and nothing happens. Such a chairman, by our typical standard, will be the first to attack the president or the state governor if any case of financial misappropriation is raised against them. Or how do we explain a situation where a head of extended family corners the heritage of the entire family for his personal use? Stories abound of how various associations and organisations split because of financial corruption on the part of their leaderships. There have also been stories of cooperative societies, thrift and credit unions and local contribution groups running into crisis after some unscrupulous members default in remitting their commitments to the bodies or the leadership diverting the contributions to other use. Consider this: an engineer in charge of maintaining a company's machines and other equipment is expected to ensure those assets work effectively. He is expected to advise the management on the best and cost-saving maintenance plan for the machines. But what one observes is that such personnel often design ways of short-changing the company to make money. High quotations are given for spare parts. The man that supplies diesel to power the generator sets delivers below the expected quantity in connivance with the engineer, who gets his cut at the end. The religious institutions are not exempted from this mess. In fact it seems to be more pronounced there! Students' union leaders see the coffers of the organisation as goldmines. The situation is bad at this (micro) level that the mentality of people has become fixated to the notion that one cannot make it without being corrupt. And unfortunately, it is this jaundiced thinking that those from this level take to the top when the opportunity comes their way. All the above instances illustrate how Nigeria has degeneratedŒæ as a nation. People at the lower cadre hide or deliberately overlook their acts of financial corruption but direct their energies at those at the top at any given opportunity. I am not trying to exonerate anybody here. But the point I am making is that until we all see this problem of corruptionŒæ as cutting across all levels of the society and fight it from that point of reasoning, we may not get the much desired headway. On a broader perspective, the problem of corruption should be seen beyond embezzling public fund either at the macro or micro level of the society. It must also be understood from the point of view of morals. How do I mean? If a man has no virtues, he should be seen as corrupt. If a woman does not value her chastity and behaves licentiously in the public, she should be termed a corrupt woman. When integrity and dignityŒæ become normal features of a society and licentiousness, bribery, wickedness, impurity and other base virtues are elevated to prominence, then such a society deserves no appellation than 'corruption extraordinaire' The society that we find ourselves unfortunately deserves this appellation. And we all are in one way or the other contributors to this state of affairs. Both financial and moral corruptions dictate our daily lives. The home front is in disarray as parents no longer serve as mirror for their children. Some parents don't find it shameful to purchase exam questions for their wards orŒæ buy results! Some mothers even encourage their daughters to dress indecently. Politicians and business moguls nest around higher institutions' campuses for young girls. Old business women and politicians also have small boys around them. The staple food sellers in the market hide the bad ones underneath the good ones to deceive unsuspecting buyers. The guy selling carpet or clothing materials in measures reduces such to shortchange his customers. The poor guy at our backyard running for local government chairmanship, councillorship or House of Assembly has one mentality, to 'eat' his own as soon as he gets there. The bus conductor will crave that you forget your balance with him and the passenger too will want him to forget not to collect the transport fare. The multi-national telcos pump millions of naira into youth-corrupting contests while earmarking a few hundred thousand to academic competitions. Beauty pageants where our young ladies will expose their priceless bodies to the world, receive multimillion naira endorsements from companies. CEOs and government officials flirt around with their female subordinates without shame. People living in 'face-to-face' apartment see no evil in illicit sexual relationships among themselves (both married and unmarried!). Gambling and alcoholism are become signposts in virtually every nook and cranny of our society. The young and the old, men and women, married and unmarried all engage in this evil. We must all understand that a corrupt life is a life devoid of God's blessings. A corrupt society experiences the consequences of corruption. All the problems our country is facing today are a result of our deep romance with all forms of corruption at all levels. If our leaders bid farewell to financial sleaze and we the followers do same. Our country will progress. At the same time if we all resolve to embrace moral uprightness in all our affairs then, perhaps God almighty will shower His forgiveness and mercy upon us once again. oŒæAlamutu writes from Lagos"376,The Sun (Nigeria),1/2/2015,"ŒæJonathan lacks capacity to fight insecurity, corruption - APC",,NIGERIA (94%),1228,Newspaper,Our Reporter,ENGLISH,,2-Jan-15,"LAGOS, NIGERIA (58%)",416 words,CORRUPTION (89%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (77%); FINANCIAL CRIME COUNTERMEASURES (72%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (72%),"The All ProgresŒ_sives Congress (APC) has urged Nigerians to use their votes to express their dissatisfaction with President Goodluck JonŒ_athan for his inability to fight the two main chalŒ_lenges facing the country: corruption and insecuŒ_rity, despite having been in power for six years.

This is even as the President admitted that graft and insecurity are the twin problems holding the country down. He also lamented that lack of vision is holding the country down. He said a situation where people were arrested and paraded on television and given media hype and yet, nothing happens was only celebrating corruption, assuring that his administration was making efforts to tackle the challenges. Jonathan said this at a special New Year service at the Dunamis International Gospel Centre, Area 1, Garki, Abuja, where he worshipped with his mother Eunice, his children, members of National Assembly, and some members of his cabinet. While admitting that a nation without a vision loses direction, the President said: ""There are two main problems confronting us as a nation: the issue of insecurity in the North where we have Boko Haram terrorists and in the South where we have commercial kidnapping. The next thing people worry about after security is the issue of corruption. ""We are coming out with programmes and plans to clean up. These are things that you don't just use magical wand to wave off, otherwise, even before I became a President, there wouldn't have been corruption in Nigeria. ""It is not just about shouting corruption. It is not about looking at one person, arrest the person and show him on television. ""It is about stregthening institutions and coming up with credible plans to make sure that anybody who gets involved with corruption, the system must have a way of detecting him and punishing him. ""Until you set such a system on ground, you cannot talk about eradicating corruption, you will just be celebrating corruption."" On security challenges', Jonathan said his administration's efforts backed by prayers of Nigerians resultedŒæ in the relatively peaceful festive period. ""You would have noticed that from Christmas to New Year, at least,Œæ it has been calm. It did not happen by accident. ""It happened because you have been praying for this country and the government has also been doing something. We do not need to announce what we are doing. ""With your prayers, we will surely get there, We will continue to come up with programmes that will help the ordinary people. The same way we won the war against Ebola, we shall win the terror war,"" he said. The President described the New Year as a turning point in Nigeria's history because of the forthcoming general elections. He said, ""2015 is a turning point because of elections. Some people will not mind if half of the country gets burnt because of their ambition. I always say that we must have a country first, we must have a people first before talking about ambition. ""We must pray that God should give us the wisdom to do things with some decorum and we should not compromise the lives of the people for ambition. ""I always say that my ambition and the ambition of any politician for that matter is not worth the blood of the smallest Nigerian."" Agreeing with the the Senior Pastor [#x200e]of Dunamis Church, Dr. Paul Eneche's sermon titled, [#x200e]""The life of vision[#x200e]"",Œæ Jonathan said no nation can move forward without proper vision. He said before now, the country had been administered based on 25-year and five-year plans before the annual budget system was adopted. He noted that after sometime, things collapsed and the government was being run on emergency basis. The President said the old days when government was run with vision would be revisited. ""For you to achieve anything, you must have a clear vision. Even if you look at what we have been doing as a nation, you will really see that before this time when the country used to have this 25 years plan, the budget was based on 25 years clear plan for the country. So you know where you are going for 25 years. ""Then it was broken down into five years plan and annual budgets and we knew where we were going. ""But after sometimes, things collapsed and we run government on emergency basis and you see government start wobblling. We are going back to those good days when we have vision. We have plan for agriculture, we have plan for industry, we have plan for automobile and many other areas. ""If you have a vision, any proposal that comes in, no matter how good must fall into your vision for it to go through. With your prayers, surely as a nation, we will get to where our vision will take us to. ""Having passed through school and being in government for quite some time, I have realised that for you to achieve anything, you must have a clear vision. ""If you have a clear vision, even if you don't get the exact target, you will get something close to the target,"" he added. Earlier,Œæ Dr. Enenche said the way people begin the New Year determines how they would end it. While saying that the quality of a foundation determines the integrity of a building, Enenche said the quality of the year would be determined by the foundation laid by individuals. He admonished that a clear definition of a destination is a clear requirement of a successful journey. ""If you don't know where you are going, you may not like where you will end. Vision is a clear picture of a preferred future. To live by chance is to end by chance"". On the importance of following the right principle to get the right result, the cleric said, ""God is not a respecter of person.

In a chat with Abuja Metro recently, Eradiri warned that the Ijaws should not think they could intimidate other Nigerians to re-elect Jonathan. He said what his people won't tolerate is people threatening Jonathan, but the Ijaw should not forget that Jonathan is the president of Nigeria and not the Niger Delta and should be allowed to fix Nigeria. Comrade Eradiri, who dismissed the impression that Buhari is the right person to fight corruption in Nigeria when he becomes the president, argued that he does not have what it takes to do so, challenging him to start the fight against corruption by probing the source of his campaign funds. He however, bluntly revealed that what might work against Jonathan's re-election would be the actions and inactions of the security personnel at the State House that have prioritised commercial interest ahead of security and the moles in PDP working assiduously to ensure that Jonathan lost out in the election. 2015 general election I want to look at the contest as perceived by Nigerians from the impression that it is a north and south dichotomy. It is a sign that we are no longer patriotic in this country. The election has degenerated into what ethnic groups stand to benefit. The situation has really put the Ijaw Youth Council in a very tight corner since we are championing the agitation for justice in the Niger Delta. It was this agitation that led to Dr Goodluck Jonathan taking over the mantle of leadership in the country. With the elections at hand, we know very well that this year is actually pregnant especially for the Ijaw and Niger Delta people. It is a year Nigerians must decide whether to move forward or backward as a nation. We must decide who will lead this country. I must admit that we are in a precarious situation because we have a president we are very proud of. Certainly, Ijaw, perceived as minority, has produced a man of history who will go down as the best president of Nigeria. Within the short time he has been in leadership, he has been able to address salient problems that touch the very fabric of this nation. He excelled in handling the power supply crisis, a sector which has troubled this country for too long. If his approach to power reforms has been allowed to reach its conclusion, it would have resolved the power crisis in this country. Yes, he could not fulfil his promise to resolve the power problems but we all know that there is no sane country where citizens deliberately vandalise power lines to melt the cables as raw material to make spoons. He did not envisage that the generator importing cartels would frustrate his power reforms. He did not envisage that certain customs hurdles would affect the clearing of electrical appliances. It is only in a country like Nigeria that citizens could bust power lines supplying gas to power stations. Ordinarily, these factors will affect the delivery of power as promised. In agriculture, this is the first time the price of food did not rise during a festive period. Foodstuffs prices were rather coming down because of certain agricultural revolutions that have taken place. People no longer sign allocation for fertilizers with intention to divert the fund. Rice production is now unprecedented that local rice now tastes better than the foreign ones. Nigeria is becoming self-sufficient in food production. It is the same success story in oil and gas. International oil companies are leaving Nigeria because they can no longer withstand the competition from local oil companies. The environment President Goodluck created ensures that Nigerians can give them run for their money. Just like in oil sector, he is the only president that thought it wise to build almajiri schools to take the hopeless northern children off the streets. He equally did well in security but for sabotage. Recall that there was clamour to remove Gen. Azzazi for a northerner in the office of the National Security Adviser but incidentally the rate of bombing has increased since then. Under Aliyu Gusau as the Minister for Defence, republics and caliphates have been declared in Nigeria. In anti-corruption fight, he remains the only president to expose the oil subsidy scam that has become part of governance in Nigeria. Yes, it is true that his approach to governance may be slow but he remains the only democratic president we have ever had. I also agree that Jonathan is not fighting corruption the way he should, but who would have had the courage to fight the menace in an ethno-conscious country like Nigeria. Nigeria is becoming self-sufficient that we are no longer asking for foreign aids. We handled the ebola threat without asking for any foreign aid and they are not happy about it. We just uncovered plan that the west are planning to congratulate Gen Buhari (rtd) even if Jonathan wins. They are already lobbying other African countries to follow suit. Immediately INEC declares Jonathan winner of the presidential election, crisis will burst in Nigeria. There has been constant blackmail against the person of Mr President. The western world and some Nigerians are waging cold war against him. The prediction that Nigeria will break in 2015 was not based on the outcome of the general election but because of the programme they put in place to cripple the oil economy in Nigeria. The truth is that Jonathan deserves more than second tenure. He is contented with the house he built as deputy governor. He is the only president whose children are schooling in the country. He deserves second term because he is capable of doing more than what he has done today. Buhari's candidacy Age is not on his side any longer because science has it that the older you get, the less productive you become. Leaders all over the world are beginning to reduce in age. Buhari was of my age when he became Head of State but he could not hold government. I don't see him doing any magic in fighting corruption because as at the time he was a general, there were few corrupt people since almost all the parastatals were manned by military officers. Today, for Buhari to pass the annual budget, he must appease the National Assembly or be ready to crumble government. He can't fight corruption because the cronies around him and the money they are spending are ill-gotten wealth. He would have asked them where the money is coming from. Initially, he was appealing to people to donate, but today money is being doled out recklessly. He did not ask whether they are corrupt money. What is the integrity of all the people around him now? If he wants to prosecute, 90 per cent of those that bankrolled his campaign will go to jail. I just hope that they are not setting up another Yar'Adua/Goodluck scenario in the Buhari/Osinbajo ticket. However, it is even in the interest of the North for Jonathan to do second term so that they can have fresh tenures. President Jonathan has weathered all odds to record these achievements. He has shown high-level tolerance and patience otherwise he would not have declared state of emergency and still left the political structures that sabotaged the system existing. Re-electing Jonathan It is not a do-or-die affair because I have always told the Ijaw protesting that Jonathan has not done anything for the tribe that we elected him Nigeria's president not Niger Delta president. We want him to join the league of presidents, solve the problems of Nigeria and prove that somebody from the minority tribe can do better. I don't believe that blood must flow to win election since none of us is ready to send our sons or relatives to the battleb front. We have however, started engaging other tribes in Nigeria to solicit support and win the election by networking, not shedding blood. Certainly, we cannot intimidate Nigerians to vote for Jonathan. Battle line drawn We have seen dangerous signals in the North because Jonathan's supporters were intimidated. It is not a good signal and ordinarily, we would have retaliated but we refused. However, we will not fail to defend ourselves when the need arises. There have been threats to the life of Mr President including a faceless organisation like MEND. But, the greatest threat to President Jonathan's re-election is the security and people around him including the Ijaws at State House, the National Security Adviser (NSA) and even the security chiefs who are not paying their staff properly. It is lamentable that SSS personnel around the president beg money from visitors to the Villa. 'Oga, we are loyal' is not supposed to be an SSS language. These are confirmation of the allegations Obasanjo raised in his new book and I was not happy how it was handled. If he claimed that people are receiving bribe for visitors to see the president, the president would have changed and prosecuted those security agents. It did not take me 10 minutes to see the President of South Africa just like other presidents around the world, but you have to face several bottlenecks from people who create a cult out of it before seeing Jonathan. I totally agree with the impression that the failure of Mr President to take a decisive step made people perceive him as a weak leader. I want to think that he is frustrated by the number of those ganging up against him and Nigerians clamouring for his change. This situation should be able to send him a lesson that people are not happy with the way he manages things. Militancy resuming if Buhari wins I won't subscribe to that much as I cannot control it. I say this because of the way the president is being intimidated. The political Boko Haram set up to destabilise him is enough for us to draw battle line by setting up our own against Buhari to see how he can manage government in crisis. I have been on advocacy for my people to tolerate the intimidation on Jonathan. But many Ijaws are not happy that the intimidation has continued. We have told them to protect Jonathan whenever he comes to the north for campaign as we protected Buhari. If the intimidation continues until he is denied second term, I will not guarantee peace and resumption of militancy if Buhari wins. However, I thank God that the oil price is crashing and I will continue to pray for it gets to $5pb. Fears for the general election My fears should be the failure of the president to change his modus operandi in terms of his target audience for votes. He should forget all these expired old men and target the youths. He must appeal to the young voters and the indecisive ones. He cannot continue negotiating with them even when it was obvious they have made up their minds. He should not be emotional in his campaigns and should not allow the tantrums of the opposition to dissuade him. He should focus on the issues that can sell him to the young voters who have benefitted in his government. I insist that he must sack some of those people around him because they will create problem for him. My other fear is the PDP factor. The party is deliberately preparing grounds for President Jonathan to lose re-election because most of them are moles. How do you explain a situation where popular candidates were short-changed during party primaries? Look at what happened in the presidential campaign in Ondo State. It was put on hold because the aggrieved party members waited till then to defect to another party in droves. They really want to crumble PDP. Nigerians must look at the antics of the moles in PDP bent on frustrating President Jonathan. How can the president go to a battleground like Kano and bank on Abuja-based ministers instead of a grassroots person like Abacha? I repeat, the PDP is deliberately preparing ground for Jonathan to fail. I want to appeal to Nigerians to look beyond party lines in electing the president. They should vote for Jonathan based on his credibility and a man who cannot hurt a fly. I can tell you that the very time President Jonathan loses the re-election, almost all the PDP governors hobbling with him will decamp to another party.

But Governor Amaechi, on Thursday, through his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. David Iyofor, described Wike's allegations as 'tisŒ_sues of lies', 'Tales by moonlight' and Wike, as a 'drowning man'. Reacting further to the allegation against their boss, Tony Okocha, who is also contesting as a House of Representatives member on the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC), decried what he called, 'exhibition of intelŒ_lectual emptiness' by those who also spoke at the ralŒ_ly, where Wike made the allegations. Okocha said: ""In the case under reference, speaker after speaker dwelt on attempt to denigrate the towering personality of an internationally acclaimed paragon of excellence Rt. Hon Chibuike RotiŒ_mi Amaechi, Executive Governor of Rivers state, the question on the lips of many is : Is Governor Amaechi running for any elective position,? More worrisome is the fact that some of these speakers inŒ_cluded those who plugged Rivers, purse in pursuit of their inordinate ambition, those who couldn't say 'Good morning Nigeria' in their 8 years of misrepŒ_resentation at the National Assembly. Those who are as inconsistent as the penŒ_dulum in a physics laboŒ_ratory, those who like ant run to sugar, they are obŒ_viously on the wrong side of history in many ways.

At a campaign rally in Kaduna last week, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Muhammadu Buhari, stunned many people when he said he would pardon a certain class of corrupt people if he were to be elected president on 28 March - just 10 days away from today. I was amazed that Buhari could undermine his own election campaign with such ill-informed comment. In a statement that surprised even his own supporters, Buhari said he would not probe corrupt leaders who had been in charge of national affairs since 1999. How self-serving! Addressing the audience, Buhari said: ""On the issue of past corrupt leaders facing trials in various courts across the country, I would allow the courts to decide on those cases, but whoever that is indicted of corruption between 1999 to the time of swearing-in, would be pardoned. I am going to draw a line, anybody who involved himself in corruption after I assume office, will face the music."" That is not tough enough, sir. It is precisely this kind of lily-livered manifesto on corruption that has compelled some people to see Buhari as a symbol of irony. In one moment, he will say all the right things that will endear him to the people. However, within the blink of an eye, Buhari will say unwise things that will wipe away all the gains he has made with regard to winning public support. It beats me why a presidential candidate such as Buhari, who is looking more serious in this forthcoming election than his performance in three previous presidential elections which he lost dishonourably, would make the kind of imprudent comment about how he would tackle corruption if he were to be elected president. Perhaps Buhari does not have smart advisers and assistants who guide him on how to say good things in the public sphere. It is not a clever thing for a presidential candidate to say he would exempt from prosecution some people who are certified to be corrupt. Corruption is corruption. There is nothing like big corruption, little corruption, or average corruption. I am not aware that there is an expiry date for corrupt acts. It seems to me that Buhari has already decided, even as he presents himself as a no-nonsense anti-corruption crusader, that he would pardon people who were found corrupt by a court or independent panel of investigation within a certain time or date. This is unthinkable. This must not be allowed to happen because Nigeria is a country blemished by corruption. The fight against corruption must be total and unequivocal. There must be no space for exemptions.Œæ There must be no statute of limitation for convicted corrupt officials in the country. I am not aware that there is a law in Nigeria that stipulates clearly that people who were convicted of corruption in the past should be pardoned after a certain period. Buhari should re-think his position on corruption. This is why I disagree with Buhari in his eagerness to please all sides of politics. How, for example, would Buhari distinguish between the seriousness of corrupt practices committed between 1999 and today and other crooked practices committed from 29 May 2015 and thereafter? This is more perplexing than anyone would imagine. People who committed corruption between 1999 and 29 May 2015 are not more immaculate than people who engaged in corruption from May 2015. Buhari must be short of ideas about how to advance his anti-corruption manifesto beyond political rhetoric. His inability to clarify his position on how he plans to confront corruption has exposed the duplicitous side of Buhari. If he is truly committed to the campaign to rid the country of the festering stench of endemic corruption in public and private spheres, he must be prepared to punish everyone who is convicted of corruption. It is immaterial to consider the period when the crime was committed. Buhari's latest policy statement on corruption is disappointing. Over the years, Buhari has carved out an image as an austere leader who brooks no hot air or people who adopt evasive measures to avoid their economic and social obligations to the society in which they exist. As the saying goes, what is worth doing is worth doing well. Buhari must sit up and reconsider his commitment to the war against corruption. In a swift response to Buhari's half-hearted explication of his position on corruption, an organisation known as ""Move on Nigeria"" said ""it is not up to Buhari to probe or not to probe past governments. No president has the constitutional mandate to execute such fiat as this is within the orbit of the National Assembly."" The national coordinator of the organisation, Clem Aguiyi, said: ""Nigeria is sick and tired of corrupt individuals and impunity in public places hence what is required is the strengthening of our anti-corruption institutions so that they can do their jobs effectively without any executive interference.""

Aguiyi said: ""It is disappointing to note that a person aspiring for the number one job does not have a clue of the job requirements and more disturbing that a man who accuses others of corruption and based his entire campaign on the mantra of change and promise to end corruption is not prepared to stand his ground when the push comes to shove."" Corruption in Nigeria is a hydra-headed monster. There are reasons why everyone must look suspiciously at Buhari whenever he talks about his duty to fight corruption. In June 2008, Buhari joined Ibrahim Babangida and Abdulsalami Abubakar to pay tribute to Sani Abacha, the most feared dictator in the history of military rule in the country. At the 10th anniversary prayer session for Abacha which was held in Kano, Buhari, Babangida and Abubakar contended that Abacha did not ransack the nation's treasury because no evidence had been presented to sustain the allegations. At that time, Buhari said: ""All the allegations levelled against the personality of the late Gen. Sani Abacha will remain allegations. It is 10 years now, things should be over by now."" Essentially, Buhari argued in support of a statute of limitation on the interval when corrupt leaders should be prosecuted in court or be allowed to go home to enjoy their corrupt wealth. Seven years after Buhari made that disagreeable comment he has resurrected the same argument about why he would pardon some corrupt people and prosecute others based on the time when they committed the crime. Buhari's argument is weak and absurd. If he wants to fight corruption, he must come out with 'all guns blazing' (pardon this clichí©). He cannot wage a war against corruption in a lenient way. Weakness of character, inconsistency, and ambiguity are not the attributes you expect to see in a presidential candidate who is campaigning against corruption. Across the society, allegations of corruption continue to worsen. This is why corruption must be dealt with forcefully and unreservedly. In the public service and in the judiciary, you will find cases of corruption. With regard to the situation in the judiciary, the Nigerian Bar Association once acknowledged the challenges facing the judiciary include ""debilitating corruption eating into and corroding the entire judicial system"". To be sure, it is not only Buhari who has demonstrated reluctance to fight corruption. Although President Goodluck Jonathan has made numerous statements affirming his commitment to eliminate corruption in our society, little evidence exists to show how he is fighting corruption. Take, for instance, the statement Jonathan made at the graduation ceremony of the Senior Executive Course (No 34, 2012) of the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru, near Jos on Saturday, 24 November 2012. Jonathan said categorically that no corrupt person, regardless of their standing in society, would avoid punishment. He said: ""We are vigorously fighting the endemic corruption at all levels and in all sectors of our country. I can assure you that there will be no sacred cows. Whoever is found to have transgressed will be made to face the full wrath of the law."" The problem is that Jonathan's government cannot point to many high profile persons who have been successfully prosecuted in the courts for corrupt practices. This is why many people choose to consign to the waste bin Jonathan's anti-corruption slogans. Here is one existing case. Ever since news broke on the oil subsidy fraud, the government has not successfully prosecuted any of the alleged offenders. It is alright to hear that some people have been taken to court. However, going to court is not the same thing as getting a conviction against accused persons. The crusade against corruption has not yet started in Nigeria. The current breed of politicians has shown they lack the capacity, the determination, and the passion to take on the challenge."386,The Sun (Nigeria),4/16/2015,"Lulu, Ogunjobi corruption allegation: Fed High Court cross-examines Ekeji",,NIGERIA (97%),1228,Newspaper,Our Reporter,ENGLISH,,16-Apr-15,"ABUJA, NIGERIA (93%)",321 words,SPORTS GOVERNING BODIES (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); WITNESSES (90%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); TESTIMONY (90%); CROSS EXAMINATIONS (90%); CULTURE DEPARTMENTS (76%),"FROM ROMANUS UGWU In continuation of the corruption charges placed against the forŒ_mer eggheads of the Nigeria Football FederaŒ_tion (NFF), comprising ex-president Sani Lulu, his vice, Amaze UchegbuŒ_lam, General Secretary, Dr. Bolaji Ojo-Oba and the technical committee chairman, Taiwo OgunŒ_jobi, a Federal High Court in Abuja yesterday cross-examined former director general, National Sports Commission (NSC), [...] In continuation of the corruption charges placed against the forŒ_mer eggheads of the Nigeria Football FederaŒ_tion (NFF), comprising ex-president Sani Lulu, his vice, Amaze UchegbuŒ_lam, General Secretary, Dr. Bolaji Ojo-Oba and the technical committee chairman, Taiwo OgunŒ_jobi, a Federal High Court in Abuja yesterday cross-examined former director general, National Sports Commission (NSC), Chief Dr Patrick Ekeji.

Speaking to journalists, Lulu maintained that he was free of the allegations levelled against him, pointing out that ""delay of justice could mean denial of justice''.

Lulu also noted that the N2.8 billion he left in the coffers of the football federation would vindicate him from the charges against him, stressing: ""This is a very sensitive matter because I left N2.8 billion in the NFA coffers, so, I need justice."" He equally regretted the deceit propagated by those that impeached him from office, noting that his impeachment was the genesis of his current challenge in court. He said: ""We were misled to withdraw our case from Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) because we love our country; I am pained, but these are challenges one has to face in life. ""I am facing this challenge because I love my country and I am taking it in good fate but at the appropriate time God will address it through those he has chosen to rescue us.

It's not a coincidence that Nigeria is a center for different kinds of corruption parasites. There are corruption parasites of all kinds in Nigeria. One variety is when officials pocket budget funds for their departments. Another is when bankers embezzle depositors money and when the bankers collude with ministers to defraud the state. Yet another is couched in ambiguous terms such as ""security vote"" for governors, ""stomach infrastructure,"" ""mobilization fee,"" ""constituency allowance,"" and so many corruption laden bogus aliases. The Nigerian poor is caged in all avenues, in every direction, are blocked and booby trapped by corruption. The experience of poor Nigerians is that their living is confined and shaped by forces and barriers which are not accidental or occasional hence avoidable, but initiated and entrenched by their own government. Look around you, you'll find government anti-graft agencies with different alphabetical soup names that serve no purpose in fighting corruption. The anti-graft agencies are a classic case of the therapeutic treatment applied to treat disorders created by the government itself. Corruption is both a major cause and a result of poverty in Nigeria. It occurs at all levels of our society - local, state, and national governments, civil society, judiciary functions, large and small businesses, military and other services and so on.Œæ The poverty foisted upon our people is exclusively a creature of the government in consensual economic dealings anchored on corruption. Conditions of concentrated poverty are visible and prevalent in our neighborhoods. Nigerians bleed from corruption and like the President-elect rightly said ""If we do not kill corruption in this country, corruption will kill Nigerians."" There is no better way to say this.Œæ One of the pillars of democracy is transparency. Citizens have right to know what goes on in the government. Citizens should be given the chance to contribute their input before decisions are made on their behalf. People should have the right to probe unaccountability in government. It is obvious that the poor are the most hard hit by corruption. Corruption undermines our political development, democracy, economic development, our people's health and much more. At all levels corruption makes it difficult for our people to effectively participate in our democracy: the people's interests are not represented. Corruption has made our lives more painful and unbearable.  For years and especially the Jonathan years, newspaper headlines compete for stories on ministers and other top government officials embroiled in scams that involve millions and billions. Despite the huge uproar and campaigns and deeper highlight on corruption by various organizations, little has been done to stem the tide of corruption. No one is surprised why the fight on corruption is so hard and seems impossible to fight. Indeed, our government in collusion with powerful interests have always made corruption difficult to fight. Come May 29, President Muhammadu Buhari should make it harder for any Nigerian to embezzle millions and billions. Buhari can learn another strategy for tackling corruption from the Chinese and the Vietnamese. In Vietnam, they don't just send unscrupulous financiers to jail, they send them to death row. In China, corruption is punishable with the death penalty if the sums acquired illegally go beyond a certain threshold.Œæ According to Vietnam's Tuoi news outlet, last year Vietnam sentenced three corrupt bankers to death by firing squad. Two of the bankers on death row embezzled $25 million from the state owned Vietnam Agribank. A 57-year old former regional boss from Vietnam Development Bank, another government-run bank, was sentenced to death over a $93 million swindling job. Several of his colleagues were sentenced to life imprisonment after they confessed to securing bogus loans with a diamond ring and a BMW coupe. But for most part, Nigerian bankers whose greed nearly caused financial collapse of our banking and financial institutions and economic melt down didn't get indicted. They got bonuses. The Chinese people viscerally hate corruption and are reluctant to see the death penalty dropped. They do not see why corrupt officials should benefit from foreign standards on human rights. ""Corrupt officials who deserve the death sentence should all be executed by shooting. Otherwise, they will find a way to save their lives with the money they have embezzled,"" says Zou Xingyu, a Chinese commentator on Tencent Weibo, a popular micro-blogging site. Chinese criminal law states that anyone who embezzles more than 100,00 yuan ($16,340) can be sentenced to death. In 1980s 103 Chinese officials at the level of ministers or above were tried in court and 80 per cent were found guilty of bribery and embezzlement. Six were sentenced to death, 27 were given suspended to life imprisonment, and 44 were given sentences of varying lengths. In 2011, two corrupt deputy mayors of Suzhou and Hangzhou in China were sentenced to death while the head of the State Food and Drug Administration was executed for corruption. The current level of corruption in Nigeria is systemic and widespread and calls for drastic solution. It is so entrenched that it is the rule rather than the exception. It is no exaggeration to say that few honest officials are victims in a country that lacks democracy, supervision, and a weak judicial system manned by corrupt judges. I believe the only drastic and effective deterrence to kill corruption before it wipes out Nigeria and Nigerians is to make corruption punishable by death - execution by firing squad.Œæ By the decisive electoral victory of Buhari in the presidential elections, Nigerians seem to be saying ""We're behind you in your crusade against corruption. Do whatever it takes to kill corruption including the use of death penalty."" In our determined march toward a new Nigeria under Buhari, how about making examples of the rotten corrupt officials with high visibility. Destroyers of our economy and lives of our people should be given swift and severe punishment. Death penalty for corruption should be our favorite method of fighting corruption and will serve as a sweet revenge for poor Nigerians - victims of corruption. .Oluwasanmi writes via HYPERLINK ""mailto:byolu@aol.com ""byolu@aol.com"391,The Sun (Nigeria),5/3/2015,Corruption: Guild of Editors wants synergy between govt and media,,NIGERIA (99%),1228,Newspaper,Our Reporter,ENGLISH,,3-May-15,,535 words,CORRUPTION (91%); FREEDOM OF PRESS (90%); JOURNALISM (89%); WRITERS (78%); FREEDOM OF SPEECH (77%); FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION (69%),"The Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) said that the battle to rid Nigeria of corruption needs a synergy between the government and the media.

The statement, which was issued to mark the 2015 edition of the World Press Freedom Day, was tagged Anti-corruption war needs journalism but added that, ""a free press will accelerate national development, give fillip to the fight against corruption, and engender a better society.""

No government can achieve lasting results without independent media."" It said that for long, the fight against corruption in Nigeria has been sluggish, even half-hearted, adding that, ""at the break of a new dawn, we must go beyond rhetoric. The government that will emerge from May 29, 2015, must walk its talk on fighting corruption, and must take the media as an ally."" It urged that government to stop viewing that media with suspicion, noting that, ""gone should be the era in which government views the media with suspicion, and takes journalists as adversaries. Now, we must begin to collaborate. Corruption is a big problem in Nigeria, and the anti-corruption battle needs journalism to shine the light on works of darkness."" The Nigerian Guild of Editors said that, it is instructive that the theme for today's World Press Freedom Day is ""Let Journalism Thrive! Towards Better Reporting, General Equality, & Media Safety in the Digital Age."" It said that Journalism must thrive in Nigeria, if Nigerians must arrive at the peaceful shore they have long envisaged. While noting that the days in which journalists are harassed, intimidated, brutalized, jailed or even killed outright should belong to the past, the NGE warned that a media under assault can only be to the nation's detriment. ""Let us build a country in which the media works without intimidation or interference. That is how meaningful change can be fostered, going beyond mere mantra or slogan. ""At the threshold of a new dawn, there is a surfeit of hope in the land.

He ran a well-orchestrated campaign as an outsider, an agent of ""change"" and the ""answer"" to everything that ails Nigeria. Well, it happens that Nigeria is in deep, deep doo-doo. And, come May 29, every Nigerian will look to Mr. Buhari to start fixing things. Buhari, I predict, will have the shortest honeymoon of any recent Nigerian leader. His political acts will be closely scrutinised, right from the outset. His ministerial list better be beyond reproach, or he's going to hear about it. Let him nominate a man or woman with an odoriferous past, and Nigerians are bound to cry betrayal! We have already seen a glimpse of what awaits his presidency. When Mr. Buhari's aides made the disastrous decision to exclude AIT Television from covering the president-elect, that ill-advised move provoked great outrage. ""It's not the change we asked/voted for,"" became the refrain on social media. As president, Buhari's every misstep is bound to attract such similar censure. He better gird himself, then, for a bumpy ride. He will become Nigeria's first citizen at a time when too many things are out off synch, and he has little - very little - margin of error. Come May 29, Nigerians will look to the ""Answer"" to answer about corruption. They will look for evidence that their new president has plans to jail those who, through acts of corruption, have contributed to wrecking Nigeria. They will look to him to neutralise Boko Haram. They will demand a roadmap to reliable electric power. They will want to see movement on fixing their country's dilapidated infrastructure. Nigerians' great expectations are going to test Mr. Buhari's mettle, as a politician and his measure as a leader. How is he going to balance the business of fighting corruption against the duty of addressing Nigeria's developmental woes? This question is of the utmost import. After all, many Nigerians desperately want to see the incoming president battle the monster of corruption. But some of them may not have reckoned with two salient facts. One is that any war against corruption would, for one, demand time and other resources. The second one is that the very nature of political realities that shaped Mr. Buhari's election is likely to constitute an impediment to his full prosecution of an anti-corruption policy. The incoming president will not have enough time to uproot corruption, which is too deeply rooted. Nor does he have the political wherewithal to launch an all-out assault on corruption. Let me contextualise my assertions. An effective war on corruption cannot be a flash in the pan, or a mere exhibition game. Many Nigerians tend to talk about corruption in the limited sense of the egregious acts of presidents, governors, ministers, commissioners and legislators. But the malaise is entrenched in every sector of the Nigerian society. Sometimes, it's civil servants who perpetrate the more devastating acts of corruption. Too many customs officers receive bribes to enable importers to evade the payment of duties to the government. Rather than focus on fighting crimes, many Nigerian police officers prefer to set up checkpoints that are, simply, bribe-collection points. How about bureaucrats, who sell civil service jobs to the highest bidder, regardless of credentials? How about lecturers who award grades to their students in exchange for cash or sex? Yet, when many Nigerians expound on a war against corruption, all they want to see is the jailing of people with high-profile political offices. Mr. Buhari cannot ignore this dimension of the fight. That's why it's encouraging that he has vowed to revisit the whole controversy of the billions of dollars in crude oil revenues that were not accounted for. The unmasking and humiliation of men and women, who betrayed their high political offices is utterly important. For one, it can serve as a deterrent to those in less visible positions. In a perfect world, Mr. Buhari should go after and jail every political office holder, who has fiddled with public funds. The reality is that he will NOT. And he will not because, among other reasons, he CANNOT. For all his pretention to being an outsider, the president-elect is, first and foremost, a politician - and a seasoned one at that. He made a calculated decision to run on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), a party that - in character and personnel- closely resembles the much-despised Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Let's not delude ourselves: The APC is far from a party of saints. It has an ample contingent of crooks to give the PDP a run for its money any day. But many of these crooks worked hard, spent tons of ill-gotten funds, to champion Mr. Buhari's presidential run. Unless he's more eccentric than we ever suspected, the president-elect is not going to throw his corrupt political sponsors into jail. And if he doesn't, then where would he find the political capital and moral authority to shame corrupt men and women, who belong to other political camps? This does not suggest that he should do nothing - or little - about corruption. In fact, his peculiar predicament presents an opportunity for an approach to fighting corruption that can be at once comprehensive and effective, even if it is not to the public's appetite for drama. Here, then, is an outline of a modest proposal for combatting corruption. First, Mr. Buhari ought to take steps to place institutions, rather than persons, at the centre of any war against corruption. His greatest legacy would lie in taking steps to strengthen and professionalise institutions like the police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The EFCC and the police should be empowered to go after any criminal, regardless of position or status, without first seeking the president's permission. In the same spirit, the president-elect should initiate measures to ensure that the Nigerian judiciary is fiercely independent, and that only persons of proven ethical disposition and sound knowledge are nominated for judgeships. That's in the long term. In the short term, he should set up a commission on restitution of proceeds of corruption. He should offer a grace period of six months to all public officials, past or incumbent, to approach the commission and make full confessions about their acts of corruption, including revealing the size of their illicit accumulation. The law setting up the commission should stipulate an offer of immunity from prosecution to all self-confessed looters, on condition that they return a certain percentage (anything between 30 and 50 per cent would make sense) of what they stole. Such a commission meets the demand of equity, enabling Mr. Buhari to treat all corrupt politicians, including his foes and friends, with fairness. The incoming president should warn all, including his political friends, that they risk investigation and prosecution should they fail to take advantage of the mercies offered by the commission. Of course, if President Buhari is serious about curtailing corruption, he should also specify that, going forward, all who betray the public trust, whether political friend or opponent, should be prepared to pay the price.

""Most of the governors were too powerful and they didn't need people's advice. Governors in the states are responsible for the failure of all the elections of the PDP in the country. All the governors should have resigned because they were responsible for the failure of the elections. So, Buhari should watch out and not make the same mistake."" ""I advise the APC to separate the party from government. Don't lump both together. They must leave those who are running the party with the party and those running government to run government.""

She is canvassing for the reintroduction of the War Against Corruption and other key areas within Buhari's 100 days in office. In this interview, she warned that the call for change by the APC-led government would remain a far cry if people of questionable charŒ_acters are entrusted with national responsibilities. You lamented the poor recogniŒ_tion accorded your late dad, the first Nigerian Acting President, Dr NwaŒ_for Orizu, by the federal and state governments. What has been the response of the Jonathan administraŒ_tion so far? The word lamented gives a very false impression of self-pity. This is a question of belief in truth and that truth crushed to earth must rise again. It is an attitude of resilience. Just like the fight against corruption in NigeŒ_ria should be continuous until majority get reasonably on cue, so should the cry against such denials continue until such anomalies cease in Nigeria. Such efforts have started to yield results. Concerted efforts have been made by the family to call the attenŒ_tion of government at the federal and state levels. Only recently, and for the first time, the Federal government in remembering our past heroes, included in certain terms, the name Dr A. A. Nwafor Orizu, the First Senate President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria who in his capacity as the first ActŒ_ing President of Nigeria handed over power to Aguiyi Ironsi at the close of the first Republic. Recently, the government named after him the Ring Road 11(Outer Southern Expressway from Area One Roundabout to Galadimawa Roundabout). This is a welŒ_come development from President Goodluck Jonathan. The late Orizu was given formal recognition during the last centenary celebration organized by President Jonathan. What do you want the inŒ_coming government to do to address this historical blunder? There should be a constitutional and ofŒ_ficial inclusion and straightening of the hisŒ_toric events that brought about the first miliŒ_tary government on January 16, 1966. Who is responsible for this historical ""vacuum"". I mean, the President should necessarily set up an unbiased and incorruptible committee to fish out the written and video recordings of the first handover to a military government in Nigeria. The 92 days His Excellency, Rt Hon Prince Dr Akwaeke Abyssinia Nwafor Orizu was the President of this great country (albeit in acting capacity) should be given a constitutional definition. Due diligence and due process should include the process of a nation's historical records. If this matter conŒ_tinues to be unattended to, Nigerian history will never be complete. I sincerely believe that the president -elect is a no-nonsense man and as I welcome him to the onerous task ahead, I believe that this area could be attended to as it is a denial to the Igbo race. It will also enhance unity. Apart from the state burial accordŒ_ed your dad when he died in 1999, has there been any benefit paid to the family by the government? It is unbelievable, but it is absolutely true. My father has virtually got nothing for serving Nigeria. The family will be happy not to suffer the same fate. I therefore, call on President Goodluck Jonathan to start proŒ_cesses that will once and for all correct this anomaly. The incoming President, General Muhammadu Buhari (rtd) can continue from where he stops. By the way, many of my siblings are in successful creative, private and public endeavors. We have been contributing to the society in no small ways. We are service -oriented. I believe that government should take a step to redress this. Looking at the last general elecŒ_tions, Nigerians overwhelmingly voted for change. Were you surprised by the poll results? The only thing constant in life is change. Politics is a part of life, and political change happens. The focus of true Nigerians should be on the milestones that can be achieved through the contribution of every Nigerian to move the country forward. Well-meaning citizens of this country should be very positive about the future of this country and give all necessary support to the incoming administration to avoid distractive engageŒ_ments. To me, it is not a question of change per se. It is actually a question of continuity. Why do I say this? I said this because it is not a question of new country about to be inŒ_habited by brand new citizens manufactured outside a new national entity, and configured in a brand new socio-economic, and geo-political structures. We must admit that NiŒ_geria is not an easy country to govern. There is simply no easy process of changing the country by any magic wand. We must realize that we are undergoing a normal process of political, economic and social growth. DeŒ_mocracy has been taking its due process in Nigeria. Progress has been going on. If you put a candid graph on the economic, social and political map of Nigeria, you will see a steady growth with successive governments. Corruption is a natural outgrowth that will take its toll and die naturally. When many other processes are put in place, corruption will reduce drastically. It's very ironic that the electronic voting system was introduced to cub electoral fraud, but what 'actually' happened? I remember a saying that one computer is more efficient than 20 men, but one smart man is more intelligent than a thousand computers. What is your confidence rating of Buhari? Do you think he will live up to the expectations of Nigerian people in a democratic setting? Nigerians prayed for the will of God during the anxious period of the presidenŒ_tial elections. I believe God answered our prayers. Our role now is to think of how each and every one of us will make Nigeria that ideal nation state we so much clamor for. The job of cleansing Nigeria is a collecŒ_tive responsibility. For when a president hapŒ_pens to be saddled with people of questionŒ_able traits, the call for real change may be a far cry. Nigerians are capable of learning. If the incoming president will be allowed withŒ_out undue pressure and distraction, Nigeria will still move a long way from where it is today. One thing must be clear; we should all see ourselves as responsible to the fate of our dear motherland. I believe that is a subtle but effective way to be a good Nigerian. Great expectations can follow. The people of South East put their eggs in one basket and lost woeŒ_fully in the last election. We saw the alliance of the South West and the North to dislodge power at the center. What would the people of the South East and South South do to gain political relevance in the Buhari administration? This is begging the issue. Nigeria is one indivisible entity and will always be govŒ_erned by one man who will be the president of Nigeria and not a geo-political zone or any tribal alliance. I like to seize this opŒ_portunity to express the view that many may not like to air even though it is the truth. The outcome of the last elections may never truly be the yardstick of measuring the reality of the political situation in Nigeria. Let us not overheat the polity by some inexcusable asŒ_sumptions. I strongly believe that every secŒ_tion of Nigeria remains relevant. Let us not over pre-empt the incoming President. He will become the president and father of the nation. Why not, if not? Again, it is absoluteŒ_ly necessary to trust your president. I believe GMB will not want Nigeria to disintegrate under any guise. His patriotic zeal even as an elder statesman is for all Nigerians. I believe he will balance his actions in such ways as to ensure equity, fair play and balance. Let us look forward and do our bits. Looking at the many problems of Nigeria, what are the key areas you would urge the new administration to address within their first 100 Days in Office? Since fight against corruption is one of the high points in GMB's agenda, there should be an initial diagnostic compendium critically x-raying this decease, including its symptoms in all aspects and at all levels without fear or favor. As soon as we read how corruption works in Nigeria in a written form, more people than you can imagine will realize they have been part of this problem, without knowing. This book of facts will also proffer solutions in writing and this will be spread to all institutions and agencies nay, to every Nigerian- that is awareness and national reorientation. Secondly, there must be more job creation opportunities for our teeming youths. SpeŒ_cific number of unemployed people must be made to leave the streets by direct or indirect employment. Thirdly, non-oil based revenue must be encouraged by increasing soft loans opportunities for other creative endeavors. Again, there must be reduction of man-hour wastage by possibly completing and building alternate routes on all major roots in the country. Imagine a situation where the entire Nigerians have used the Niger Bridge for 50 years. Think of the man hours that have gone on both sides of the bridge for 50 years. This is a tip of the iceberg considering other such situations in almost all parts of Nigeria. The government can take definite steps in this direction. Moreover, the new railway systems being introduced in the country should be given priority to help decongest the roads and save man-hours and improve productivity. The waterways should be dredged to help decongest the existing wharfs and increase business and employment. Another very critical area is the reintroŒ_duction and improvement of War Against Indiscipline. Also, for a start, the new adminŒ_istration should aim at achieving full current 24/7 light for the first 100 days. Credible and sustainable measures must be put in place to bring the dollar closer to the Naira at the international market. In addition the entire school system should experience a new lease on life. The last but not the least; the prices of food must start dropping even as the gap between the rich and the poor should clearly start closing. This may start by a new salary and tax reform. What are those specific areas you would like the incoming government to address to reposition Nigeria and strengthen people's faith in national unity. I like to observe that I am fully aware that so much has been done in the area of setting agenda for a better Nigeria in all aspects. We have the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We have the Transformation Agenda. When these ideals are put in full practice, I bet you Nigeria will look like our dream nation state. What we need might be certain policies that can bring about some positive shift towards national unity. Let me, therefore, enumerate some here for serious consideration and adoption by the incoming government. There is absolute need to inculcate the spirit of oneness in all Nigerians. PDP is like a sinking ship, rocked by internal crises. Do you foresee an imminent end to the party that once prided itself as the largest in Africa? The decrease in the strength of a politiŒ_cal party should not be the end of its life. In western democracies, ruling parties change from era to era and so it continues. Nigerians must also outgrow the must-win or do-or-die attitude to elections. Failure should be a lesson for future strength. The APC victory today is a result of lessons learnt from almost two decades of disillusionment. I don't see why PDP should not sit up and face the chalŒ_lenges ahead. The outside world must conŒ_tinue to see us as mature. Nigeria has come of age and should be seen as such. GEJ has given them the lead that he is a real democrat that believes in politics without bitterness."397,The Citizen (Tanzania),10/19/2013,Chinese firms fail the corruption test,,"CHINA (94%); INDIA (94%); BRAZIL (93%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (92%); AFRICA (79%); PAKISTAN (79%) ",,Newspaper,"Songa wa Songa,The citizen",ENGLISH,,8-May-14,"DAR ES SALAAM, TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (90%)",919  words,CORRUPTION (91%); BRICS COUNTRIES (90%); STOCK EXCHANGES (90%); EMERGING MARKETS (89%); MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS (89%); CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (78%); RANKINGS (78%); ECONOMIC NEWS (77%); FOREIGN INVESTMENT (77%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (76%); RESEARCH REPORTS (76%); BRIBERY (71%); WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION (70%); CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (68%); PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES (58%); POLITICAL DONATIONS & FUNDRAISING (50%),"The report also points out the listed companies' outstanding performance.

Chinese multinationals, some of which have investments in Tanzania, have performed dismally in a new anti-corruption report released on October 17 by the German-based anti-corruption watchdog, Transparency International. The research into the public reporting practices of 100 emerging market companies puts China at the bottom of a special section covering BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). India tops the cluster, followed by South Africa, Russia and Brazil. BRICS accounts for up to 20 per cent of global economic output and 15 per cent of trade in the world. Despite its poor showing in the report, China-also known for its soft stance in its engagement with African leaders on human rights and good governance issues-has vast business interest in Tanzania. Its companies dot the economy. But in the company results arena, most Chinese companies score between two and zero per cent. Most of these companies-18 by our count-have direct investments in Tanzania or business interests through subsidiaries. Researchers reportedly collected and analysed data on three dimensions of transparency: Reporting on anti-corruption programmes covering bribery, facilitation payments, whistleblower protection and political contributions, organisational transparency including information on corporate holdings and country-by-country reporting that includes revenues, capital expenditure and tax payments. The report also points out the listed companies' outstanding performance. The survey sample included companies with different ownership structures: Of the 100 companies, 71 were listed on stock markets. Of the other 29, 17 were state-owned and 12 were in private hands with no publicly-listed shares. According to the report, the publicly-listed companies performed better than the two other groups at an average of 53 per cent. ""As was observed in a previous Transparency International study, listed companies exhibit higher public reporting standards owing in part to mandatory reporting obligations and the need to respond to pressures from investors,"" the report says. By: contrast, state-owned and privately owned companies had minimal scores of 30 per cent and 27 per cent respectively. According to the study, entitled Transparency in Corporate Reporting: Assessing Emerging Market Multinationals, of the 75 companies from BRICS in the sample, 33 were from China, 20 from India, 13 from Brazil, six from Russia and three from South Africa. The results rank companies from India ""the best overall"" among BRICS with a score of 54 per cent (5.4 out of a maximum score of 10) on the strength of their performance on country-by-country reporting. South African companies follow closely at 51 per cent, leading in the first two dimensions-reporting on anti-corruption programmes and organisational transparency. ""China lagged behind with a poor score of 20 per cent (two out of a maximum score of 10),"" the report says. Specific results on reporting on anti-corruption programmes indicate that Chinese companies are the worst performers in the group, at 28 per cent on average. Huawei Technologies was cited as the best performer among the 33 Chinese companies at 62 per cent but two other Chinese companies-Fung Group and Chery Automobile-messed up the average country rating with a zero score. Three South African companies scored the highest in the segment with an average score of 79 percent, followed by 20 Indian companies with 63 per cent. Russian and Brazilian firms achieved average results of 54 percent. On organisational transparency, Chinese firms performed the poorest at 31 per cent. In this segment, South Africa ranked highest (75 percent) followed by India (69 percent). Chinese companies also came last in country-by-country reporting with a score that the report describes as ""a mere one per cent"". In the segment, the best performing companies by far were Indian. The report attributes this achievement to Indian law that requires all companies to disclose key financial information for all their subsidiaries. Dr Honest Ngowi of Mzumbe University's Business School said the study may not result in a major shift in China's growing commercial and industrial influence since the irregularities cited are not limited to the country. Noting that only levels and sectors differ, Dr Ngowi argued that opaque business practices are typical of the global capitalist system. ""It is not uniquely a Chinese thing,"" he said, adding that if another study were to be conducted in the extractive industry, for instance, some Western companies were likely to change places with China. But Prof Delphin Rwegasira of the University of Dar es Salaam argues that the message in the report is likely to see China take drastic measures to enhance its corporate transparency record. If it does not, he says, it can expect to suffer in the long run as its bargaining powers will diminish because of pointed transparency issues-thereby reducing the emerging giant into a mere price taker. ""We should remember that China has also invested heavily in the integrity-sensitive US and Europe and it cannot sit back and relax,"" he said. ""This report will, in a way, lead to China changing the way it does things."""398,The Citizen (Tanzania),11/15/2013,Most Africans say war on corruption is failing,,AFRICA (95%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (93%); SIERRA LEONE (92%); KENYA (92%); MAURITIUS (79%); ALGERIA (79%); MOROCCO (79%); NIGERIA (79%); SENEGAL (79%); PAKISTAN (79%); ASIA (79%); NAMIBIA (79%); BOTSWANA (79%); CAPE VERDE (79%) ,,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,8-May-14,,419  words,CORRUPTION (91%); POLLS & SURVEYS (90%); BRIBERY (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); RESEARCH REPORTS (78%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (78%); CIVIL WAR (72%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (71%),"Dakar, Thursday. A majority of Africans believe their governments are not doing enough to curb corruption, according to a landmark survey across 34 countries published Wednesday, with police seen as the most unscrupulous institution. Some 56 per cent said their countries were doing a poor job of fighting graft, while one in three had recently been forced to bribe a public official, according to a survey of more than 51,000 Africans by the Afrobarometer research project. ""The fight against corruption has had a very high profile in the last decade both with African leaders, and among regional and international organisations and donors,"" the organisation said in a report released in the Senegalese capital Dakar. ""Afrobarometer data shows that these efforts have not been sufficient to curb corruption levels."" Police attracted the highest ratings of corruption among public officials across the 34 countries, with 43 per cent saying that ""most"" or ""all"" were involved in corruption. The figure was as high as 78 per cent in Nigeria and 69 per cent in Kenya and Sierra Leone -- but just 14 per cent in Algeria. Government and tax officials also scored badly, while judges and heads of state fared best in the survey, carried out between October 2011 and June 2013. Thirty per cent reported paying a bribe in the past year to obtain a service or avoid a problem, with the figure rising to 63 per cent in Sierra Leone, one of the world's poorest countries after a brutal 11-year civil war that ended in 2002. Morocco, Guinea and Kenya all fared badly while fewer people said they had paid bribes in Namibia, Mauritius, Cape Verde and Botswana. The International Monetary Fund projects that sub-Saharan Africa will grow at 5.7 per cent in 2013, outpacing most regions and rivalling Asia's boom markets. But while strides have been made in reducing the numbers of Africans living on less $1.25 a day, more than a third of the world's extreme poor still live in sub-Saharan Africa. The Afrobarometer research project involves a number of independent African organisations and measures public attitudes on economic, political and social matters in sub-Saharan Africa. Its report, titled ""Governments Falter in Fight to Curb Corruption: The people give most a failing grade"", also found that the poorest were punished the most by corruption. Almost one in five people who had gone without food in the past year had paid a bribe to obtain medical treatment, compared with just over one in 10 among those who never went without food."399,The Citizen (Tanzania),12/1/2013,Combat grand corruption and give Tanzania deserving good image,,"EASTERN AFRICA (94%); AFRICA (94%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (94%); PAKISTAN (79%) ",,Newspaper,Ngai Goodluck,ENGLISH,,8-May-14,,676  words,CORRUPTION (92%); POLICE FORCES (90%); BRIBERY (89%); EXTORTION (78%); POLICE MISCONDUCT (78%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (77%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (77%),"A survey done by Transparency International (TI) in East Africa has come out with a result that the Tanzania Police force is the leading corrupt sector in East Africa. This report has largely ruined the image of our country. In a country that is believed to be ruled under the principles of democracy, such a report is a disgrace to Tanzania. Worse still, our Police Force, which is one of the sensitive public institutions, is the leading rot. This only shows that corruption is deep-rooted in the present government. The Tanzania police scored an astonishing per cent; tax services (36.9per cent); land services (26.9 per cent and others (31.3 per cent). Looking at it closely, the most corrupt sectors are also the most important sectors for the country's sustainability. With such a nation, we still have a long way to go in terms of progress. In any nation, corruption is a hindrance to development. So if key sectors of the nation are highly involved in corruption, we are derailing from the line of nation-building. The police and judiciary might be the only ones that have been examined by TI during its research. However, there are still a lot of sectors that have an intricate connection in the network of corruption. If they are all exposed, then we would see how corruption has made our nation one horrible picture of disgrace. Corruption is a great enemy of justice and equality; if tolerated, we will not achieve meaningful development in any sector. Through corruption, only the minority will survive on ill-gotten wealth while the majority in society will remain trapped in a high state of poverty and despair. According to the TI report, many of the Tanzanians interviewed said that they paid bribes to hasten service delivery. In order for an accused person to be granted bail quickly or easily at a police station, for example, bribes must be paid by the person seeking that right. For those with no money to corrupt officers, no matter the case, they will remain locked up in cells for a couple of days or even weeks. Since most Tanzanians are aware of the fact that corruption fast-tracks services, the service providers tend to create obstacles so that the person uses extortion. This has become habitual in almost every institution in the country. Reportedly, a person once went to the power utility firm Tanesco and asked the staff to connect electricity to his house. He had the money to pay. Since the money was the exact amount and the engineers would not get any, they told him they had no wires. What a tricky way to extort bribes ! It's very common to call the police only to be told they have no fuel in their vehicle. So you must contribute a bit. How can this happen for a police vehicle on patrol not to havefuel? This is astonishing. Despite the existence of an institution like the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB), corruption persists to a large extent unabated. Is this institution really doing its job? The government has invested large amounts of money into PCCB, but for a long time now it has not been effective and corruption is increasing at an alarming rate, as indicated in the TI report. The corruption cases that are dealt with by the PCCB happen to be just minor ones involving small amounts of money while those of grand corruption are not dealt with. The ones involved with grand corruption are freely moving around the country. More efforts need to be exerted for this institution to do its job efficiently. Government sectors must be the anti-corruption front liners and not a part of the leading corrupt sectors. This will help create a good image of the government and promote effectiveness in providing services to the citizens. Instead of our Police Force being the leading corrupt institution, it should be taking the lead in facilitating the prosecution of all the corrupt elements in society. It is best to bring about changes that will make Tanzania the good nation that we all want, free of corruption.

The country scored 33 out of 100 in the organisation's 2013 index released yesterday, two per cent down from last year. The index ranks 177 countries by perceived levels of public sector corruption and draws on 13 surveys covering expert assessments and views of businesspeople. Botswana maintained its global position at number 30, making it the least corrupt in Africa. Rwanda climbed from 50 last year to 49 this year. At 111, Tanzania is the second least corrupt country after Rwanda. It is followed by Kenya at 136, Uganda 140 and Burundi 157. Transparency International declared: ""From children denied an education, to elections decided by money not votes, public sector corruption comes in many forms. Bribes and back-room deals don't just steal resources from the most vulnerable. They undermine justice and economic development and destroy public trust in leaders."" According to the organisation, the 2013 index paints an alarming picture since more than two-thirds of the countries, including Tanzania, score less than 50 per cent. All parliamentarians The Citizen spoke with conceded that the government has not been serious enough in combating graft. Ubungo MP (Chadema) John Mnyika said the report comes at a time Parliament is set to discuss the Controller and Auditor-General's (CAG) report, which has been significant in pinpointing loopholes for embezzlement in government expenditure. ""This transparency report will help build our arguments on public corruption and embezzlement of funds paid by our taxpayers,"" he said. But he criticised the group for not identifying why Tanzania and other countries dropped in the list and what the least corrupt countries had done to overcome the problem. ""As far as Tanzania is concerned, I think the culture of government big shots protecting corrupt people is the one that is bringing this country to its knees,"" he added. ""A number of public officials have been named in lists of shames but nothing tangible has been done."" Mr Moses Machali of Kasulu Urban (NCCR-Mageuzi), argued that the goverment is weak and unable to address corruption. He added: ""Our leaders are not serious about the problem. There are many top officials who are accused of corruption but the government is not taking action. We should consider being ranked 111 a big favour. The real situation on the ground is bad."" For the government to address corruption, the MP said, there must be people who can take action against those who break the law. Muleba North's Charles Mwijage (CCM) had this to say: ""We need to understand that we have a problem. We must admit this problem. The number we are ranked does not matter. We can even be number 200. What is important here is that we have a problem and we must keep fighting it."" According to the MP, he has received many letters from his constituents complaining about corruption and he believes the important thing is to work together with the government to strengthen institutions and come up with strategies to handle the situation. Efforts to get a government reaction to the drop in the ranking proved futile. Last week, though, the director-general of the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB), Dr Edward Hosea, told The Citizen the prosecution was to blame for the slow pace in the war against corruption. ""Globally, it is also difficult to investigate cases of corruption,"" Dr Hosea added. ""It is difficult to get watertight evidence that is admissible in court because, most often, the vice is committed in secrecy."""401,The Citizen (Tanzania),12/5/2013,Let's eradicate corruption,,PAKISTAN (74%) ,,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,8-May-14,,200  words,CORRUPTION (93%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%),"Transparency International (TI) has released this year's Corruption Perception Index, in which Tanzania is placed in position 111 out of the 177 countries that were surveyed. The country scored 33 per cent in TI's 2013 Index that was released on Tuesday, two per cent down from last year. Though the TI survey can't be taken as the final and perfect verdict of Tanzania's corruption status, the truth remains very clear: corruption is a cancer that continues to eat into the core of this country's public and private sectors. And then, we have the problem of viewing the war against corruption as the duty of two institutions: the media and the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB). This is a wrong notion. Fighting corruption should be a noble duty of all citizens of this country because at the end of the day we are all victims. We must all hate corruption and stop nurturing it, because if anything, it can only sort out our problems for a short period. As the media and sections of the general public fight corruption, the anti-corruption watchdog, the Judiciary and other organs should pull up their socks and play their part more actively and decisively if the vice is to be eradicated."402,The Citizen (Tanzania),12/22/2013,How Dar can curb corruption,,SPAIN (92%); ESTONIA (90%); BRAZIL (79%),,Newspaper,Athuman Mtulya,ENGLISH,,8-May-14,,497  words,CORRUPTION (97%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); LEGISLATION (89%); BRIBERY (89%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (87%); POLITICS (87%); ETHICS (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (76%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (76%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (73%); CITY GOVERNMENT (71%),"Tanzania has to pull up its socks and back words with commitment if the country wants to triumph against corruption, says Transparency International (TI). The organisation recently ranked Tanzania at 111 out of 177 countries on its 2013 Corruption Perceptions Index, nine places down from the 2013 index. Since the publication of the 1996 Warioba report assessing the state of corruption in Tanzania, the country has established a comprehensive body of regulations, laws and oversight institutions aimed at preventing, investigating and sanctioning corrupt practices, including the Prevention of Corruption Bureau (PCB) to Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB), and the Ethics Inspectorate Department. However, anti-corruption institutions suffering from lack of staff, resources and coordination, enforcement of the laws and regulations remaining limited, which some view as the reasons behind the stalling of the fight against corruption. ""Despite 2013 being a year in which governments around the world passed new laws and forged fresh commitments to end corruption, people are not seeing the results of these promises"", said Transparency International. According to the organisation, anti-corruption is an increasingly attractive platform for politicians, with many incorporating anti-corruption pledges into their election campaigns. The danger, however, is that these anti-corruption promises fail to materialise. ""Government guarantees of greater accountability do not always bring about tangible results at the local level. Protests in Brazil this summer showed public exasperation at the continuation of political scandals in spite of governmental assurances of a zero-tolerance policy on corruption,"" claimed the organisation . Borrow a leaf Tanzania and the Sub-Saharan region as a whole once again shows the highest perceived levels of public sector corruption, averaging a score of 33. According to TI, there are however success stories which showed action in executing anti-corruption strategies. Estonia established a new anti-corruption strategy centring on increasing transparency in state institutions by creation of online database accessible to all, where people can find who in their municipal council won a tender and what can be done with taxpayer money.  The effort, among others, saw the country climbing four places in the index, from 32 in 2012 to 28 this year. According to the latest corruption studies in the country, 18 per cent of Estonians said they had been offered bribes and four per cent had given bribes. The strategy is not dealing with crimes directly, but rather focusing on prevention and education. In Spain, after a period blighted by political scandals indicating a lack of accountability and fading public trust, the country has dropped ten places in the index from 30 last year to 40 this year. Spain tried to remedy its corruption troubles with a new Transparency Law passed by a congress in September and awaits Senate's approval ."403,The Citizen (Tanzania),2/10/2014,Electoral corruption and demise of the Leadership Code,,"TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (96%)",,Newspaper,Attilio Tagalile,ENGLISH,,8-May-14,,908  words,CORRUPTION (92%); TAXES & TAXATION (90%); PUBLIC FINANCE (90%); ELECTION FRAUD (90%); PUBLIC DEBT (89%); EXTERNAL DEBT (89%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (76%); HISTORY (73%); INVESTIGATIONS (71%); BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (64%),"The Sokoine Memorial Stadium in Mbeya is increasingly being transformed into a political pulpit for crusaders keen to fight corruption and other ills afflicting Tanzania. The first time corruption was on target from the stadium firing range was in 1995 when the Father of the Nation, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, lashed out at the second phase administration of President Ali Hassan Mwinyi for its failure to collect taxes. Mwalimu, who was addressing the nation from the stadium that carries the name of one of the most credible leaders in the country's history, said governments that fail to collect taxes are usually corrupt. He said such governments do not collect taxes because they were being controlled by wealthy businesspeople and other moneyed individuals. Mwalimu's accusation against the second phase administration was not baseless for the government was then collecting a paltry Sh25 billion in taxes per month! He said Tanzanian manufacturers had complained to him personally that they were not against importation of foreign products similar to what they produced. ""Our only problem is that such products are not taxed and are, as a result, killing our businesses,"" they had told Mwalimu. When the third phase administration of President Benjamin Mkapa came to power later in 1995, it proved right Mwalimu's allegations against the second phase governmenmt. Mr Mkapa's administration was collecting over five times what was being earned in taxes by Mr Mwinyi's. The third phase administration also reorganised the institution responsible for tax collection to what it is known today as the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA). It also went on to streamline collection of taxes and payment of the country's foreign debt to the point that a section of the country's creditors were so impressed by Tanzania's efforts that they wrote off some of the debts. But the foreign debt that had been reduced quite considerably during the third phase administration has now ballooned to Sh27 trillion. Instead of expressing remorse, the newly appointed Finance minister has the audacity to tell the world that the staggering debt notwithstanding, Tanzania is still creditworthy. But after Mwalimu had ""shouted"" at corruption at the Sokoine Memorial Stadium, did the third phase administration do anything apart from putting more effort into collecting taxes? It did not, apart forming the Warioba Commission to probe the extent of corruption in the country. Although the Warioba Commission came up with fantastic solutions on how to deal with corruption, nothing was done both by the third phase government and subsequent administration which has maintained the same ""shouting"" tempo, but pushed action to the back seat. And last week, President Jakaya Kikwete, speaking from the Sokoine Memorial Stadium, was at it, this time warning those who are allegedly using corruption in the course of campaigning for the highest office on the land - the presidency. He cautioned Tanzanians to be wary of people who were using money to ""buy"" elective posts, including the presidency. There is, however, only one point on which I personally agree with the President and that is it is wrong for one to start campaigning for the presidency now. However, electoral corruption, regardless of who the president was pointing a finger at, is not a new thing in this country. We have had corruption in elections since the second phase administration decided, through what has come to be referred to as the Zanzibar Declaration, to bury the Arusha Declaration along with the Leadership Code. After the official death of the Leadership Code, it became possible even for leaders to amass wealth and most of them used (read 'abused') their offices to enrich themselves. Mwalimu had enacted the Arusha Declaration, and in particular, the Leadership Code, because he knew that without separating leadership from business it would be extremely difficult to deal with conflict of interest. And those who criticised the policy of Socialism and Self-Reliance did so simply because of the cloth that both the Arusha Declaration and the Leadership Code had been wrapped in, namely, the Ujamaa Policy thing. Otherwise Western countries, like the US and Britain, don't allow their elected leaders who were businesspeople before their election to continue running their businesses concurrently with their political leadership. Now if the fathers of democracy do what they do, why not Tanzania? After the killing of the Leadership Code by the second phase administration, it is difficult for any leader to claim his or her hands to be untainted or to accuse others of using corrupt means to attain leadership. But if we are really serious about fighting corruption, as we want to be viewed by others, then we ought to do two things before the 2015 General Elections. One, the Leadership Code should be brought back in our statutes. Two, the onus of proving whether or not one is corrupt should lie with the accused and not the accuser as it is at the moment. And the best way of dealing with the foregoing is to give the person alleged to be corrupt a piece of paper to explain how he or she came to own what he or she owns. The point is the evidence should not be provided by the accuser, but rather by the accused and many Tanzanians will have to explain how they own those castles in Dar es Salaam and elsewhere However, if we are not prepared to do implement the two suggestions, then we should simply shut up.

Four former top officials with the Tanzania Electric Company Limited (Tanesco) have been charged at the Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court with two counts of abuse of position and occasioning a loss of Sh275 million to the government. Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) filed the charges yesterday against former deputy managing director Robert Semhihu, procurement officer Harun Mahambo, director of finance Lusekela Kasanga and a lawyer Godson Makia. Charged along with the four is Mr Martin Simba who is supplier of M/S Young Dong Electronic Company Ltd. However, only one accused, Mr Makia (lawyer) was present at the court yesterday where he denied the charges read out by PCCB prosecutor Isidory Kyando. The accused was returned to remand prison for failing to meet bail conditions. Makia appeared before resident magistrate Hellen Riwa who also ordered an arrest of the other accused so that they would be sent to the court to answer charges against them. According to prosecution, on diverse dates between January and December, 2011 at Tanesco office situated at Ubungo within Kinondoni Municipality, the four accused (Semhihu,Mahambo,Kasanga and Makia) being employed by Tanesco, in the discharge of their functions, intentionally abused their positions by facilitating and effecting payment to the supplier (Simba). The accused allegedly helped the supplier to violate section 35 of Public Procurement Act No. 21, 2004, thereby enabling the said Simba to obtain or have undue advantage in the contract. According to prosecution, the accused committed the offence contrary to section 31 of the PCCB Act No. 11, 2007. On the second count, the five accused jointly allegedly during the same period and place by their wilful acts caused a pecuniary loss of Sh275,040,000 to the government. After reading the charges, Mr Kyando informed the court that investigation of the case was complete. Mr Kyando also asked the court to issue an arrest warrant for the remaining four accused so that they would be sent to court to answer charges against them. Magistrate Riwa agreed with the request and adjourned the case to April 30, this year when it would come for mention while waiting an arrest of the other accused. For Mr Makia, the magistrate ordered him to deposit cash Sh27.5 million or a title deed of an immovable property equivalent to the sum. He was also required to secure two reliable sureties who would sign a bond of Sh27.5 million each. However, the accused failed to meet the bail terms and was returned to prison. Tanesco top officials were suspended in 2012 along with former managing director William Mhando to pave the way for investigation into corruption and embezzlement allegations."405,The Citizen (Tanzania),5/20/2014,Migiro backs anti-corruption laws,,"TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (92%)",,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,20-May-14,,226  words,CORRUPTION (92%); LEGISLATION (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); LARCENY & THEFT (72%),"Dodoma.

Dr Migiro said there were strong laws to convict and punish people who would be found guilty of misusing, stealing or sabotaging the nation's economy. The minister was responding to Mr Moses Machali (Kasulu North- NCCR Mageuzi) who wanted to know if the government was planning to enact new laws that would help to curb corruption in the country. According to Mr Machali, there were many loopholes in the current laws and that there was a need for enacting new or amending existing ones to help stop corrupt leaders and public servants from misusing taxpayers' money. ""I think it is high time the government came here with a bill that will lead to the formation of new laws to punish people who are involved in corruption-related activities,"" he said. According to Mr Machali the new law must state categorically that those who would be found guilty of stealing public funds and sabotaging the economy would be hanged. Dr Migiro responded that the country was being ruled democratically by adhering to all principles of good governance and that all those who would be found guilty would be punished according to the laws of the land."406,The Citizen (Tanzania),5/25/2014,Corruption monster is not tackled earnestly,,"TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (92%)",,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,26-May-14,,608  words,CORRUPTION (91%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); POOR POPULATION (90%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (89%); BUDGETS (89%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (77%); ECONOMIC NEWS (77%); PUBLIC FINANCE (76%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (75%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (73%); SCANDALS (73%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (64%),"Grand corruption, the crime that makes poor Tanzanians poorer,forcing many to die in want, is clothed in many robes, and treated as a big spoon, not a spade. The majority citizens who live in poverty have been crying out for development, but the actions of many of our leaders show a different story. Can we have Tanzania free of corruption? In the current political and economic settings, that is like asking for a miracle. It seems being a political leader is a ticket to presiding over corruption. The Bunge budget session is once again with us, and watching the proceedings and decisions made, one wonders if our leaders in the august House have a hidden agenda. Are they there to preside over sustainable utilization of the available resources for the economic development of the nation and its people? What we see, many times, is that, they don't really care about the actual needs of wananchi but their own political survival. I can say with certainty that the overwhelming majority in the National Assembly don't have the political will to address the corruption monster that is eating the beloved motherland. If they were ready to, after scrutinizing last year's budget, I don't think there is any minister who can survive. Let them prove me wrong. I am not saying that ministers are corrupt but that over the years they have failed the nation in taming the monster and they must take responsibility for that. From the local government to the national government, annually, a huge chunk of the budget is swallowed by the said monster. This year, also a new saga has emerged - IPTL power deal, which could see the nation lose billions to foreigners. The office of the Controller and Auditor General (CAG) has been doing splendid work letting the public know how their money is misused every year. ut the parliament, the arm of the government that is supposed to keep the executive on check, has been sleeping on the job. It passes the budget every year, without making those who have wasted public money in the previous year pay for it. In the government, purchasing goods and services is where the biggest corruption scandals occur. Goods and services paid for and not supplied is a common story. But even worse, is the over pricing. It would be interesting to know how many matchsticks the government buys and how many we the common folks buy. For years, our budget has been dependent partly on donors. They were banking on Tanzania to at least meet some Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), but it has been a disappointment. A National MDG report (Tanzania) by 2012 indicated that the goals to reduce poverty by 2015 were off-track and deemed not achievable. The failure to achieve the MDGs has been associated with the decrease in donor support from $744 million in 2008 to $573.3 million in 2011. The report highlighted further that, the decrease can be linked to the government's failure to deal with reported high profile corruption, which has now been a 'song' as these scandals are captured in every public expenditure audits in different financial years. Under such circumstances, donors have no choice but to reduce or stop their support which is supposed to help reduce poverty but maybe ending up in the pockets of the corrupt. Donors are aware that Tanzania has not made significant progress in reducing poverty despite its taunted ""sound economic performance"". So if they stop supporting Tanzania due to corruption, the poor will suffer most. The Swahili saying says Kikulacho ki nguoni mwako (that which eats you is within you). The mafisadi are mainly Tanzanians. They make the lives of the poor hell and no one is accountable.

""That was a very shameful act, an attack against freedom of speech, an attack against a former prime minister and an elder, we are very much disappointed,"" he said.  From Arusha, former central bank governor Edwin Mtei, however, urged the Chairman of the defunct Constitutional Review Commission (RC), Judge (rtd) Joseph Warioba, not to give up.  Mr Mtei said what had befallen Judge Warioba and former CRC commissioners was a curse inflicting on youth in the country, for it was unbecoming for them to assault eminent persons like Judge Warioba.  ""It is shocking to see youth insulting and assaulting an elder who was educating the people. All what they could do, if they disagreed with him, was to adhere to laid down procedures,"" he said.  High Court advocate Mr Method Kimomogoro, said what happened was a criminal offence, calling on state organs to investigate, arrest and prosecute the culprits in the incident for them to serve as a lesson to other thugs.  ""Intruding into an event held in a conference hall is tantamount to trespassing one's private home,"" said the lawyer, explaining that the Mwalimu Nyerere Foundation, which had organised the symposium, had invited some people.  CCM National Executive Committee member Paul Makonda who was accused of orchestrating the chaos yesterday called a press conference and denied the claims and added that he did not attack Mr Warioba as reported in sections of the media.  ""I don't know the youth who caused chaos. If I organised and sent them, they would have come to my rescue when I was being assaulted,"" he said."413,The Citizen (Tanzania),11/18/2014,Corruption has reached alarming levels: Membe,,"KENYA (94%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (94%); AFRICA (94%); NIGERIA (93%); GHANA (93%); UGANDA (93%); SENEGAL (92%); PAKISTAN (79%); MIDDLE EAST (79%); EGYPT (79%)",,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,18-Nov-14,"DAR ES SALAAM, TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (92%)",903  words,CORRUPTION (91%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (78%); AIR POLLUTION (78%); WATER POLLUTION (78%); POLLS & SURVEYS (77%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (76%),"Dar es Salaam. Corruption among political leaders, crime, unreliable electricity supply and water pollution are leading causes of concern to Tanzanians, a new study has shown.  Other issues causing wananchi sleepless nights are traffic jams, air pollution and poor healthcare, according to the 2014 Pew Research Centre survey.  Nine out of every 10 Tanzanians, or 90 per cent, today feel their political leaders have become more corrupt than elsewhere in Africa, according to the 2014 Pew Research Centre survey. Their thinking is that their leaders have become more corrupt than they were in 2007, when a similar study was done. Tanzania's rating of the corruption cancer was highest among 34 emerging and developing countries surveyed, topping countries such as Nigeria and Kenya that have traditionally fared poorly in levels of corruption perception.  In the study, Tanzanians have the most number of those who are worried about corruptionnine in ten. Others, with their percentage in brackets: Uganda (87), Nigeria (88), Ghana (85) and Kenya at 77 per cent rounded out the Top Five African nations in corruption perception. Tanzania has also seen the largest swing in corruption perception over the last seven years, from 68 per cent in 2007 to 90 per cent this year, according to the survey by the US organisation.  The survey interviewed 38,620 respondents from March to June this year in 34 countries including nine in Africa.  Tanzania is followed closely by Tunisia where 89 per cent of citizens feel corruption was their biggest problem. Colombia came third with 87. Other African countries surveyed are South Africa (70) and Senegal (66).  The last study was conducted when President Jakaya Kikwete's government was barely two years in office and the current one has come out with just one year to election of a new administration.  Crime is the second nightmare at 84 per cent, up from 62 in 2007. In Africa, it is second only to Nigeria with 88 and Ghana and Uganda with 85 each. Kenya followed closely with 83, Senegal 82 and South Africa 72.  At global level, Tunisia, which together with Egypt falls under the Middle East category, emerged tops with 93 per cent rate in crime, followed by Colombia and El Salvador with 90 each. Argentina follows with 89, Pakistan 87, Chile and Venezuela 86 each and India 85.  Tanzanian has posted percentages higher than overall median for all countries which are 76 for corruption and 83 for crime. Poor quality of schools came out as the third top most concern for Tanzanians according to the public perception survey. Citizens interviewed rated it at 84 this year, up from just 42 recorded in 2007. This is second to Uganda's and Ghana's 76 and 69 respectively. Kenyans expressed 49 per cent dissatisfaction with the quality of education.  But on a positive note, Tanzanians have highly rated their public institutions surveyed with the military and the media polling 90 and 95 per cent of satisfaction respectively, up from 85 and 86 respectively in 2007. All surveyed countries generally gave the media high ratings, but Tanzanians topped the count. Uganda and Nigeria also viewed the media highly (94 and 90 respectively), while 88 per cent of Kenyans thought the media was in the black.  The media rating for Tanzania was surprising because despite State controls, it still earned a higher rating than the government itself, which has an 83 per cent rating.  Other institutions surveyed with their percentage of satisfaction in the bracket are religious leaders (96 per cent), financial institutions (88) corporations (82) central government (83) civil servants (79) and court (69). Generally, the survey found that crime is seen as a very big problem by a median of 83 per cent across the 34 emerging and developing economies surveyed.  A median of 76 per cent across 34 countries said corrupt political leaders are a very big problem in their country. This comprises the top spot in 10 of the countries surveyed, including in China, where 54 per cent said corrupt officials are a big concern.  Outstandingly, Africans are far and away the most concerned about corruption, with a median of 85 per cent though the issue also emerged in other regions including Eastern Europe. In Russia and Ukraine, 65 per cent and 73 per cent respectively cited corrupt political leaders as a top problem.  A median of 59 per cent across emerging and developing markets said healthcare is a very big concern. But overall, Latin Americans, Africans and Middle Easterners are more worried about health care than Asian publics.  While no emerging country cited poor quality schools as its greatest problem, a median of 56 per cent were very worried about this issue with concern appearing to be greatest in Africa and Latin America. A global median of 54 per cent rated both water and air pollution as a very big problem. Also, a median of 50 per cent said food safety was a pressing issue. Concern for the safety of food was greater in the Middle East and Latin America compared to Africa and Asia. In 14 nations, the military received the highest ratings among all the institutions and groups tested. Nine-in-ten or more in Tunisia, Senegal, Lebanon, Vietnam and Tanzania ranked it as a good influence.  Overall, a median of 79 per cent said the military was a good influence on the way things are going in their country, while only 18 per cent said it was a bad influence."414,The Citizen (Tanzania),11/19/2014,UK court exposes corruption ring at Kenya election agency,,KENYA (96%); UNITED KINGDOM (94%),,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,19-Nov-14,"LONDON, ENGLAND (90%)",377  words,CORRUPTION (92%); ELECTION AUTHORITIES (90%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); BRIBERY (90%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (89%); ELECTIONS (89%); CONTRACT AWARDS (89%); VOTERS & VOTING (89%); EXECUTIVES (88%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (78%); PRINTING INDUSTRY (78%); EVIDENCE (77%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (77%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (77%); INVESTIGATIONS (76%); BALLOTS (73%); FORENSICS (71%); INFLATION (70%); ECONOMIC NEWS (70%),"London. Kenya's election officials pocketed millions of shillings in bribes to award lucrative printing contracts to a UK company over a two-year period, prosecution documents filed in a London court show.  In a legal battle that has left in its wake one of the best documented cases of an international corruption network in Kenya's history, the UK prosecutors have filed in court loads of written evidence implicating senior election officials in the corruption ring, including Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) chairman Issack Hassan. Court documents show that the Kenyan taxpayers paid dearly for the illicit dealings between senior Smith  Ouzman (SO) officials and the senior managers and commissioners in the defunct Interim Independent Electoral Commission (IIEC), putting to shame Kenyan prosecutors and the anti-corruption agency officials who have yet to nail anyone for the offences.  ""The scale of the corruption alleged by the prosecution is worth Pound 349,057.39 (Ksh50 million) in Kenya,"" the prosecutor Mark Bryant-Heron says in court filings.  For many of the printing contracts, costs were inflated by up to 38 per cent mainly to cater for the kickbacks  commonly referred to in the mails as 'chicken'  to senior election officials, the UK prosecutors say.  The prosecutors say ""the corrupt payments were built into SO's pricing of the printed materials so that the inflation in the price as a result of that corruption was passed onto those funding the institutions that contracted with SO.""  Forensic investigations by the UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) show that top IIEC officials, the predecessor of IEBC, variously asked for bribes codenamed 'chicken' to facilitate SO's winning of seven tenders to supply election materials such as ballot papers, voter registration forms, voter ID cards and nomination forms.  Energy Cabinet Secretary Davis Chirchir, who worked as a senior manager at the IIEC, tops the list of senior government officials named in the corruption racket. (NMG)  The list includes suspended IEBC chief executive James Oswago, former Judiciary registrar Gladys Boss Shollei (deputy CEO), lawyer Kennedy Nyaundi (commissioner), Kenneth Karani (senior procurement officer) and the finance director."415,The Citizen (Tanzania),12/3/2014,"Corruption, a hydra-headed crime, is deeply entrenched in Africa ntinent",,AFRICA (97%); SUB SAHARAN AFRICA (92%); SOUTHERN AFRICA (79%); UGANDA (79%),,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,3-Dec-14,,2684  words,CORRUPTION (91%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (89%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (89%); TAX LAW (88%); TAX ENFORCEMENT (87%); TRENDS (78%); BUDGETS (77%); EMERGING MARKETS (76%); EMBEZZLEMENT (76%); EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (73%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (72%); RULE OF LAW (72%); TAXES & TAXATION (67%); CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES CRIME (65%); TAX FRAUD (62%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (60%); FOREIGN INVESTMENT (60%),"Since the days of colonialism, Western countries have always had an obligation to support former colonial territories in terms of development. Colonial governments set up social, political and economic structures. However, after independence, we were not trained how to manage and develop the resources we had. They have injected billions of dollars funding various development projects. Irrespective of all this, African counties especially Sub- Saharan Africa has become even worse. Corruption and mismanagement of public funds, assets and resources is becoming the order of the day. The reason for this is partly because we are just given resources whose value we do not know because we do not work for them. Recently, the US ambassador to Uganda said they would massively cut direct budgetary support to the country in order to look at financial crisis back home. As humans, we mostly look after what we value, and we mostly value what we work hard for.  Post-independence African countries inherited deeply corrupt institutions, laws and values from colonial and apartheid governments. In the majority of African former colonies, the colonial elite centralized political, economic and civic power, exclusively reserving top jobs in the public and private sector, as well as education only to fellow colonials. At the time in the colony, the institutions that should have served as watchdogs against corruption: the judiciary, police, security services and rule of law, selectively served the interests of the elite classes. These institutions were more often subservient to the all-powerful colonial administrator or governor. The colonial private sector, for the most part, produced for exporting to the imperial market and as such was usually deeply depended on the colonial government for licences, contracts and subsidies. This sector rarely held the colonial government to account. With the exception of a few, colonial media sources were equally bridled. Corruption is a pervasive problem in both the developed and developing world.  In recent years, the problem has gained much interest due primarily to a series of high level corruption cases in industrialised countries, an increasing awareness on the cost of corruption throughout the world and the practical and economic changes many countries are undergoing. In Africa however, corruption is a development issue. In 2009, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Southern Africa Representative Jonathan Lucas labelled corruption as ""a crime against development, democracy, education, prosperity, public health and justice - what many would consider the pillars of social well being.  According to the Global Integrity Index the African continent receives approximately $25 billion annually in foreign direct investment, while $50 billion flow out every year this is an escalating trend. Corruption, dysfunctional regulations and weakly enforced rules create an environment for the illicit transfer of private capital abroad, tax evasion and tax avoidance by individuals and companies, and blatant embezzlement of government revenue by corrupt officials. The consequential erosion of the tax base and increased public expenditure widen the resource gaps faced by African countries and perpetuates their dependence on external aid.  Corruption further mushrooms when opposition parties are weak and irrelevant. In some African countries, the main opposition parties are either associated with the colonial or the minority governments, or had opposed independence, leaving them with legitimacy problems. In many instances, opposition parties were focused on ethnic constituencies. For far too long, African ruling parties have gotten away with blaming the previous colonial administration - apartheid government or opposition movements (which are often associated with the ousted colonial or apartheid governments) - for their own government failures.  It is common knowledge that African ruling parties make it difficult for opposition movements to operate, often throwing their leaders in jail, depriving them of funds and continually threatening their very existence. By force or negotiation, many independence movements annex opposition parties making one large united party (albeit with ongoing tensions).Opposition parties that eventually come to power in Africa often offer few alternatives to existing corrupt regimes installed post independence.  In many African ruling party circles, there were misguided beliefs that there were 'no victims' of corruption. Yet, corruption has a disproportionate impact on the livelihood of the poor. Corruption undermines the delivery of public services including public housing, healthcare, access to water and adequate sanitation, and access to reliable supplies of electricity. Corruption diverts financial and other resources that can be used for development with respect to job creation, and poverty alleviation instead weakening the capacity of the state to deliver effective services and also equally undermining the trust of ordinary people in government.  Even the so-called 'quiet corruption' is damaging. This kind of corruption might not necessarily involve money changing hands, but entails factors such as absenteeism (at work by public officials) or deliberate manipulating of rules for the benefit of front line service providers, such as teachers, doctors and other government officials"". For example, a child denied adequate education because teachers did not attended classes regularly depriving children of the necessary skills needed to play a productive part in the economy once they reach adulthood. A World Bank study showed that 'big-time' corruption of senior political leaders' encouraged this sort of 'quiet corruption.  Most African ruling parties and leaders lack the political will needed to genuinely tackle corruption. Legislative gaps in dealing with corruption must be strengthened, and the enforcement of internal anti-corruption controls within states must be improved. Sadly, scrutiny, enforcement and compliance in African public sectors have often been very low creating opportunities for corruption.  The corruption-fighting capacity of existing institutions must also be strengthened. Africans need independent anti-corruption structures, which should be led by agencies in the private sector or civil society. Such agencies will ensure that corrupt officials are brought to book, as well as forcing police and public watchdogs to follow up on cases of corruption exposed in the media and by whistleblowers. Nonetheless, these watchdogs must get the appropriate resources required to attract the best candidates and to remunerate them (and in some cases protect them) appropriately.  Furthermore, these institutions must be independent from the presidential office or the executive department, such as the police or justice ministry, and be accountable directly to parliament. African ruling parties must punish the bad behaviour of their leaders and party members legally, socially and politically, as well as reward good behaviour. If this is highlighted and addressed publicly, governments can begin to restore the moral authority and credibility needed to deal with transgressions from ordinary citizens. Exemplary leaders will encourage ordinary citizens (themselves included) to uphold the rule of law. Civil society will have to play a role in 'naming and shaming' those leaders who espouse corrupt values while encouraging those who behave with integrity.  African ruling parties must train up and bring in a new calibre of leadership at all levels. As well as being competent and honest, these candidates must operate with integrity. A system of merit must be brought into internal party elections. Candidates must be judged on the basis of competence, moral character and genuine commitment to public service. Merit-based appointments to jobs in the public service, and in politics, will significantly contribute to reducing the patronage system of jobs for 'pals', which only works to foster an environment of corruption.  Tanzania has undergone a significant transformation since independence. Now a multiparty democracy with strong economic growth, the government has taken a variety of steps towards good governance and anticorruption through its National Anti-Corruption Strategy and Action Plan. While there is an established media and civil society presence, the government's restrictions on freedom of press and association limit the role these stakeholders can play in the fight against corruption. Against this backdrop, corruption is still rampant and is an issue of particular concern in the context of the country's growing extractives industry. Corruption both within the public and the private sector risks to undermine any benefit that citizens can gain from the extraction of natural resources.  Corruption is a major concern for foreign companies and investors in Tanzania, according to the assessment by the US Department of State 2013. As stated in the report, corruption is economy-wide and measures to combat it are applied impartially to foreign and domestic investors. Foreign companies have identified petty corruption as a particular obstacle to investment. This perception is supported by the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014, where business executives have identified corruption as one of the most problematic factors for conducting business in Tanzania, only outdone by access to financing.  According to the report, companies consider the occurrence of irregular payments and bribes in Tanzania to be common. In addition, companies' unethical bahaviour in their interaction with public officials, politicians and other companies has been identified as a competitive disadvantage for the country in the aforementioned report. Pervasiveness of corruption scandals in Africa range from Goldenberg scandal in Kenya, Cash gate scandal in Malawi and now the Richmond and Escrow saga in Tanzania, in Zambia, Lieutenant General Sakala was facing two charges of theft by public servant and abuse of authority of office. The general was caught by his wife cheating with a young pretty woman prompting him to fire in the air. This is just the tip of the iceberg.  Despite the government's anti-corruption efforts, Tanzania continues to suffer from rampant corruption. Corruption is cited as one of the major constraints in doing business in the country (World Economic Forum 2013). The country also ranked 111th out of 177 countries in Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index 2013, with a score of 33 out of 100(Transparency International 2013). However, when bench-marked against its neighbours Kenya, Uganda, and Mozambique, the country is perceived to be performing better.  On a lighter note, once corruption becomes entrenched, its negative effects multiply. It induces cynicism, because people begin to regard it as the norm. It undermines social values because people find it easier and more lucrative to engage in corruption than to seek legitimate employment. It erodes governmental legitimacy because it hampers effective delivery of public goods and services. It limits economic growth because it reduces the amount of public resources, discourages private investment and saving and impedes the efficient use of government revenue and development assistance funds. Indeed, a series of mega corruption scandals in Tanzania paint a glaring scenario on how we manage to put our house in order. The controversial Richmond Development Company (which had later become Dowans Holdings), had tried to obtain more than $115 million from the government in 2006 for capacity and energy charges, under the latter badly discredited emergency power supply contract it had signed. But this represented a hefty profit as it had only spent $30m to instal the planned 100 megawatt power plant in Dar es Salaam. Richmond/Dowans was subsequently paid more than $42m. The government had also paid $4,865 (approx. Shs 6bn) for airlifting some of the power generators, consumables, and other accessories from the United States. But, apparently, what the company brought in was only 20MW of power generating sets  one fifth of what was needed under the contract. This however, still represented a hefty profit for Richmond, considering that the company spent just $30 million to instal the plant in Dar es Salaam. Dowans Holdings apparently bought the remaining power generators from South Africa. But a government technical team sent to Cape Town in December 2006 to assess the trailer-mounted turbines was said to have discovered that some of the equipment was rusty.  The formal termination of the contract between Richmond/Dowans and the government in 2009 paved the way for certain persons to set in motion yet another plan to obtain $69 million by selling the power generators to the government. It was only the fierce opposition to the proposal mounted by the parliamentary Energy and Minerals Committee and others that blocked this from going ahead.  On the same vein, while some MP's were becoming increasingly restive as they waited to hear the government's reactions on the numerous recommendations in the parliamentary report dated February 2007, the government announced that it intended to resurrect the company, as electricity supplies were again proving inadequate . In October 2009, there was some surprise, amid escalating power rationing, that the government's call for tenders for new emergency power generating plants failed to attract any competent bidders.  Under such scenarios, employees of the Bank had been charged over the loss of Sh 104 billion, in yet another scandal involving the inflation of the cost of printing new bank notes. The fourth scandal concerns the siphoning off, by some 22 companies, of Sh 133 billion through the Bank's EPA account which has been described in detail in earlier issues of TA. In this case, former senior cabinet ministers Basil Mramba and Daniel Yona (plus two other senior officials) have been charged with abuse of office that caused the Government a loss of over Sh 221 billion after granting tax waivers to a gold auditing firm, Alex Stewart (Assayers). The controversial assignment saw the company take $50 million in fees which sparked off a public outcry. Seventeen witnesses were being called to testify against the former ministers but the defence refused to reveal the names of their witnesses. The magistrates accepted this before the case was adjourned. The prosecution said, during the preliminary hearing, that Mramba signed government notices exempting the corporation from taxes in disregard of advice given by the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) and had prepared an agreement between the company and the BoT which was amended without Attorney General and cabinet approval.  Another mega corruption scandal was in the Radar case switched to the UK where the Senior Fraud Office (SFO) completed its enquiries and is asking the Attorney General to proceed with the prosecution of BAE which supplied the equipment. The Times of London wrote that if BAE would agree to pay up to Pound 500 million (Tanzania is not the only country in which the company is accused of paying bribes) in a 'plea bargain' the problem could be resolved. But BAE felt that any admission of guilt would be unacceptable as it would undermine its huge markets in the US and other countries. With the SFO's ultimatum, it had decided to call the SFO's bluff. It indicated that if the figure (for the Tanzania case) was in the range of Pound 10-20 billion and that BAE would not be tainted with corruption and instead faces lesser charges, negotiations might be renewed. In dealing with Prime Minister Gordon Brown (and not Tony Blair) BAE was likely to be rebuffed.  Progress in the investigations in Tanzania had been going slowly  the Director General of the PCCB was said to be waiting for the final report from the SFO in the UK.

The eight-point drop in the Corruption Perceptions Index makes our country the second least corrupt in East Africa. This may seem an honour that should excite us. It should not because, though we have been spared the disgrace of being the region's most corrupt, we are essentially in the same league as Burundi, which bears that tag.

The Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau cannot, on its own, stamp out the vicewhich has become so deeply entrenched that it has attained cancerous proportions.  Individuals and civil society organisations, national institutions, religious denominations and other interested parties should coalesce into an anti-corruption fighting force. Distinguishing between petty and grand corruption, with the former tolerated and the latter despised--is utterly wrong and must be discouraged. Whatever the degree, corruption erodes the gains we make in other areas of governance.  It ranges from a local government official who demands a Sh5,000 bribe to stamp a document for a mwananchi to a senior public servant who pockets several million shillings to endorse a lucrative deal.

Mr Rugemalira is the former minority holder in Independent Power Tanzania Limited, which is embroiled in the Tegeta escrow account controversy. Speaking to reporters shortly after leading Christmas Mass at St Joseph's Cathedral, Rev Nzigilwa said he would speak out on the matter at a later date. ""We are celebrating Christmas...let's stick to this as I prepare an explanation about the issue you are interested in. I will give it to you once it is ready,"" he said.

This might seem like nothing extraordinary. As sad as it makes me to admit this, you probably know that they won't be heading there for a museum tour.  Not many young Tanzanians these days will voluntarily visit the National Museum. Still, how to get local teenagers and twenty-somethings interested in museum tours is an issue for another day and another article that must be written. Save for the tragic lack of interest in national history, what happens at the National Museum every first Sunday of the month when Jeans and T-shirt is held is nothing short of remarkable. There is nothing in Dar that is quite like it, something that fuses together things that local conventional wisdom often suggests should not go together  like hip-hop music, dance, fashion and spoken word poetry with conversations about integrity, faith and hope and love, lots of it.  Soppy, you think? Not quite Tanzanian? Well, Jeans and T-Shirt is an intercultural space, bringing together people of different back grounds, with a variety of interests. It aims to let young people interact with other young people as well as providing a platform for their artistic and moral and character development. And doors are opened to all for free.  Jeans and T-Shirt is a space in which young people get to interact with other young people as well as a platform for their artistic and positive moral and character development. Held since 2013, on every first Sunday of the month, it brings together artists of various kinds and aims to showcase and develop the diverse forms of artistic expression that form part of the Tanzanian artistic landscape.  Next month's event will be held on 1 February, under the theme 'Keep walking.' And yet, it is not exactly accurate to describe Jeans and T-shirt as just an event.  It is perhaps more accurately described as a movement emphasising healthy character building without however being in any way prescriptive about who joins or interacts with it.  And while the emphasis is on young people, Jeans and T-shirt is not in any way a youth-only space. Its themes aim to speak to contemporary challenges in Tanzania that particularly affect youth but are not limited to them.  As the largest demographic in Tanzania, it is important that young people develop a balanced image of not just themselves but the country they live in, if they are to see themselves as change or development agents.  So, for instance, in December 2014, Jeans and T-shirt ran with the theme 'Mzalendo Mia Mia.' Between performances by top artists from around East Africa, the event aimed to redefine patriotism by emphasising hope instead of hopelessness, celebration instead of despair and the reality that young people have the power to push for the change this country needs.  The Jeans and T-shirt event itself is fully organised by a team of volunteers, many of whom are students, affiliated with R.I.O.T. (Righteous Invasion of Truth) Foundation, an organisation whose vision is for a wholistic culture representing Christ in all of its facets. Practically speaking, the Jeans and T-shirt organising team demonstrates that it is possible for a group of motivated young people to organise themselves and their resources financial, time and talents  to consistently organise an event of this magnitude. Jeans and T-shirt now regularly attracts more than 600 attendees every month.  Also, by regularly giving young people a platform on which to express themselves artistically, as well as providing them with mentorship and support, it demonstrates how important such an avenue is. It is worth noting that Jeans and T-shirt has held more than 15 monthly events since May 2013 and that each event has been financed by the organisers themselves and through the pledges of other mostly young people. That in itself is revolutionary and counter-cultural for Tanzania.  ""You are doing a lot for the young men and ladies in Tanzania.

A week after President Jakaya Kikwete reshuffled cabinet and swore in new ministers, Members of Parliament have started to bay for blood of two other ministers after oversight committees revealed massive embezzlement, corruption and theft of public money.  Debating the reports yesterday, MPs from both camps of the House called for accountability from Finance minister Saada Mkuya after a Budget Committee report showed that her ministry had spent ring fenced money running into billions of shillings for purposes other than what it was intended for.  The report shows that the ministry diverted money meant for Rural Energy Agency (Rea) and the Road Fund. Quoting Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA), the committee shows that between July and November 2014 petroleum levy collected amounted to S80.7 billion.  According to the law, all this money was supposed to be forwarded to Rea for distribution of power in the rural areas, but as of this month the remitted money amounted to only S44.2 billion. On the other hand, S9.6 billion meant for Rea was realised from customs processing fee but only S2.2 billion was remitted. The total amount of money that the ministry diverted from Rea is Sh43.9 billion. The House also wants the minister out after the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) revealed massive loss of public money through tax exemptions, grand corruption in major projects as well as embezzlement of public funds in a number of areas. Lawmakers also demanded immediate sacking of the Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office (Regional Administration and Local Government), Ms Hawa Ghasia, owing to the revelation of financial mess ups in local authorities.  Mr Tundu Lissu (Singida East  Chadema) insisted on the need to make the two ministers accountable in order to put a stop to the growing trend where people have become insensitive to massive theft of public money.  ""The problem is not bad people or poor leaders but impunity. Each year Parliament is treated to such massive theft and corruption such that we have become insensitive to bad news. Unfortunately, nothing tangible has been done to arrest this situation.  ""We must decide now as Parliament. If we decide to condone the tendency let us continue with business as usual. But if we want to be accountable, let us start now by coming up with formal resolutions over these two ministers as a starter,"" he said.  Mr Lissu said it was unfortunate that impunity has been the order of the day in the government. He even castigated President Jakaya Kikwete for sidestepping his constitutional duty of taking action against judges implicated in the Tegeta escrow account scandal.  However, this statement attracted a rebuttal from the Attorney general, Mr George Masaju, who noted that according to the Constitution, the President has no powers to directly discipline the judges.  ""According to article 113 of the Constitution, the President can take measures against judges only after he is advised by a Judicial Service Commission after investigating the judges in question,"" he said.  Debating the reports earlier, Ms Asumpta Mshama (Nkenge  CCM), said it was unfortunate that the Finance minister has decided to divert funds meant for rural electrification and road improvement to other uses without first obtaining permission from the Parliament.  ""In fact, in doing so the minister has violated the law because these funds are ring fenced. We enacted a law to make sure that monies meant for Rea and Road Fund are not used for other purposes. Where had the minister obtained permission to divert these funds?"" she asked.  She also wondered how council executives have been reporting of paying ghost workers. ""How can they pay workers who are not there?"" she queried. Mr Godbless Lema (Arusha Urban Chadema) likened Tanzania to a ghetto where people live without rules or regulations. ""Looking at the way people have been stealing public money while those responsible with taking them to task failing to do so, Tanzania is no different from a ghetto where rogue youths may decide to eat food before it is served on the table,"" he said. ""If leaders were innovative, this country could earn a lot from the tourism sector alone. But, given the speed of misuse of the funds, even if we collect S trillion a month, we will not achieve anything,"" he said. Ms Esther Bulaya (Special Seats  CCM) said in diverting the ring fenced money the Finance minister had not only violated the law but the Constitution as well. She cited Articles 135 and 136 of the Constitution which put in place conditions for management of money for special purposes noting that for this the minister does not deserve chance to resign but should be fired and charged immediately."420,The Citizen (Tanzania),2/3/2015,Dar plots survey 'marred by corruption',,"TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (91%)",,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,3-Feb-15,"DAR ES SALAAM, TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (91%); DODOMA, TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (74%)",211  words,POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); HOUSING AUTHORITIES (78%); LITIGATION (77%); NATURAL RESOURCES (77%); CITY GOVERNMENT (75%); ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES (72%),"  Dodoma. The project to survey 20,000 plots in Dar es Salaam was reportedly marred by corruption and the government has been tasked to investigate the allegations.  This is one of the resolutions proposed by the Lands, Natural Resources and Environment Committee in its annual report, which was later adopted by Parliament.  Tabling the report, Committee chairman James Lembeli (Kahama  CCM) noted that as a result, the project has not attained the intended results of curbing haphazard development of Dar es Salaam City.  He said after being notified about corruption, the committee directed the ministry of Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development to hand over the report.  ""My committee rejected the report for it failed to address the core issues we raised. The report did not present the real situation of execution of the project,"" he said.  The committee was further informed that corruption marred the compensation payment involving some of the ministry and municipal officials. Some are said to have grabbed several plots in their names and concealed some from the surveyors, and these they later sold exhorbitant prices.  ""The committee would like the government to identify all these officials and take appropriate disciplinary and legal action."""421,The Citizen (Tanzania),2/4/2015,Corruption world,,"TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (92%)",,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,4-Feb-15,,43  words,CORRUPTION (92%),"  I see the president signed the Public Administration Management Act in December, establishing yet another anti-corruption agency.

We don't wish to question the validity of the findings, for we don't know what methodology was applied to reach their conclusions. Likewise, we cannot say that PCCB staff comprises angels, because those who work there are part of this societywhich embraces corruption. And for sure, the Afrobarometer findings are not about to make us conclude that the anti-corruption unit is now totally incapable of fighting graft on account of its poor moral standing ""as uncovered by the pollster.""  We, however, expect the PCCB leadership to view the findings, not as a cold blanket, but a challenge, a wake-up call to engage itself in soul searching. If there are bad apples in their midst, they should know what to do, wouldn't they?  As it were, we at The Citizen believe that fighting corruption is the noble duty of every Tanzanian and not just the PCCB. The first step to curb corruption is for everyone to speak loudly against it, hate it, and shun it.  The trouble with today's Tanzania is that we are increasingly becoming a society in which the corrupt are adored. Those who work to earn an honest living and retire with just enough to keep their body and soul together are viewed with derision. They become the proverbial laughing stock, fools who had a chance to ""eat"" but chose to remain hungry (read not to steal).  Affected by corruption  We are a nation of 45 million who have all been affected by corruption directly or indirectly. We know our brothers, sisters, friends and parents who are corrupt. But we say nothing we do nothing about it.  In case we speak, it is about glorification of the corrupt, describing them as heroes who have been smart enough to take full advantage of their high office.  It is of no use to lament on how corrupt we are. We all know there is corruption, but the big question remains: what are we doing to address the situation today?  It takes two to tangle. Which means, there must be more than one person for bribery to take place. Who are these people who bribe because they want to circumvent the procedures?  How often do people bribe at the bank or hospital to avoid the long queue? People bribe from birth to death, meaning, we have made corruption a way of life.  That is why we reiterate our stand that fighting corruption is not just the PCCB, it is about all of us as Tanzanians. There will always be some hurdles with our justice system in dealing with corruption, but, the best court to fight corruption starts at the family level.  It starts from the grassroots level with people saying No to bribery demands and receiving. We all must have the courage to shame the corrupt.  But then, when voters agree to be bribed with a khanga, a kilogramme of rice and soda in return for their votes, what moral authority will they have to condemn corruption?"423,South Sudan News Agency (SSNA),5/4/2013,Thumps up for officials who speak against corruption in RSS!,,SUDAN (95%),1349,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,12-Jul-13,,1888  words,CORRUPTION (89%); POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS (76%); HUMAN RIGHTS (74%),"By: Justin Ambago Ramba May 4, 2013 (SSNA) -- Let's start by answering the basic question of whether the SPLM led government in Juba - South Sudan is in any way capable of transforming this nascent country into the continent's oasis of the much talked about democracy, whether that be under President Salva Kiir's leadership or any one of his handful colleagues of the SPLM political Bureau for that matter? To answer the above question one needs to look back into this quasi political party's history and have a good look at all those skeletons it harbors in its cupboard. One will also need to check the party's track records on good governance and the respect of human rights. But above all you will need to acquaint yourself with the true nature of how this monstrous organization has feasted on its own supporters while promoting a limitless impunity as it rules without the least consideration of the supreme law of the country - which is none, but its own hand made transitional constitution of the new republic of South Sudan. After you are done with the above then and only then can you qualify to pass a fair judgment and for that matter a verdict that strongly suggests how blindfolded the entire population of South Sudan remain to be while the SPLM under Salvatore Kiir Mayardit does away with every bit of that beautiful dream they onceŒæ hadŒæwhen independence from the ""Jallaba Rule"" is finally attained. Why hasŒæeverythingŒæbeautiful that they had Œædreamt forŒæthemselves and the country they so dearly sacrificed for suddenly become only for the few privileged?? There is no way that the current leadership in the office can continue to boast of being any patriotic. And even though a few are still locked up in the nostalgiaŒæŒæof the bush war andŒæŒæareŒæŒærightly or notŒæŒæclaimingŒæŒæsome patriotism, again the truth of the matter is that,ŒæŒælong gone are those old days. As sad and unfortunate as it is,ŒæŒæwhat is practically left in front of us now is clearly a bunch of corrupted thieves and monsters who have long been intoxicated with powers to steal, kill, arrest and make to disappear with a total impunity. Let me take you through one of this government's showdowns and you will find it extremely nauseating to see the so-called leaders talk, and are being talked to, and being talked about. It has been reported in the Sudan Tribune online May 1, 2013 (JUBA) , that the South Sudan president Salva Kiir Mayardit saidŒæŒæhe wouldŒæŒæno longer tolerate members of his cabinet accusing the government they serve in of corruption, arbitrary arrest and human rights issues. Here I quote: ""He warned that he will no longer turn a blind eye to those in the cabinet who go outside the country to accuse his government of mismanaging the affairs of the nation while serving the same system"".[ST.] And further to clarify his point that he is determined to spy on his ministers and all other officials, the president went on to add and I quote: ""From now on I will be tracking what cabinet ministers do and say when they leave the capital, Juba"". President Kiir stressed! [ST] President Kiir determined to blackmail his cabinet members to the best of it leftŒæŒænothing to chance as he gave them [ministers and senior officials]ŒæŒæall what he intended to say and frankly the presidentŒæŒækept nothing behind, especially when he pointed the finger of corruption and extrajudicial killings at his cabinet members and senior officials. This is what he said in Sudan Tribune: ""They talk as if they are not part of it [government] but if you follow them, you find they are the same people who are the ones involved in corruption. They are the ones involved in arbitrary arrest, but they come out in the day and say they are not part of it"", he said. There you go now and you are left with only one conclusion in mind and that most arbitrary arrests in South Sudan are carried out on the instructions of more senior government officials both at federal and state levels. Some observers claim that many officials use it as an alternative method for silencing political opponents and critics of their performance. This is confirmed by Sudan Tribune as a wide belief held by the people of south Sudan. Is Sudan Tribune rushing to conclusions here?ŒæŒæOf course not! Otherwise how are we and any others expected to interpret the president's words, when he squarely placed the entire blame on his cabinet members. According to Mr. President these people [his ministers & senior officials] often commit these horrible crimes back home in south Sudan and when they are out of the country the same people go out to condemn the government for crimes that were committed by none but themselves. Should Mr. president be telling the truth and in which case he is this time, we are then left with ministers who are not only the true culprits of the ills that befell our country, but they are also greedy hypocrites for they continue to operate together as a government or better still as brothers in loots, yet when confronted abroad with all the evidence that suggest a record breaking corruption, lack of vision and the absence of the rule of law , they become witnesses against their government which they continue to serve in. Two things are clear here and it is that president Salva Kiir Mayardit himself is a hypocrite. Of course he has long been so. However in the case at hand the president is rightly an adamant hypocrite forŒæŒæthe fact he without the least doubt has the full knowledge and in that caseŒæŒæis completely aware of his senior officials' short comings and their grossŒæŒæinvolvementsŒæŒæin arbitrary arrests and surely as it implies to include allŒæŒæthe extra judicial killings and disappearances. Yet instead of holding these corrupt officials accountable, he [president] has for his own sake has chosen to rather use all these shortcomings as tools of blackmail against the officials with the intention to in return secure and guarantee their loyalty and silence. What a way to run a government and a country!!? President Salva Kiir is undoubtedly disturbed by the US State Department's country report on the nascent country of South Sudan. And he is rightly being worried and ashamed of those incidences of human rights violations, widespread rape, impunity, corruption, and the total absence of the rule of law. More unfortunate is the fact that each year's report seems more worse than the one it preceded. No way can the president challenge these reports as they rain year after yearŒæŒæsince he too has openly accepted and declared in an open and broadcasted speech how his officials carried out these horrendous acts and yet go out of the country to play the role of the ""good guys"". As for the cabinet ministers and the SPLM senior officials, altogether with their security dogs, it's only one thing - your boss has exposed you, locally, regionally, and internationally. In other wards worldwide you are known as the true culprits of the mess that RSS is in now. Of course the good news for you here is thatŒæŒæthese ex-posersŒæŒædon't in any way spare the president. You are all in the mess together - remember this is true before Man & God! Let's reason out things well, for its no good to stab anyoneŒæŒæfrom behind. The bottom line is that everything in this world has a price attached to it, and when you choose one, you also choose to pay the price. Those of us who choose to expose the mistakes of the government will continue to do so out of deeply rooted conviction to serve our country and people by the way of enlightenment and civic education. Should anyone who chooses to accept a cabinet job under the current status quo and God forbid, then they must be prepared to relinquish being an opposition. It is said that"" You can NOT eat your cake and still have it"", yet this very simple logic seems to be in shortcoming. It is common knowledge that South Sudan is rapidly sinking under the weight of poor and visionless leaders. And although the whole thing now stings of corruptions, and impunity, yet many fainthearted opportunists are drawn towards serving under this administration for the simple fact that they too share the same genetic traits with those in office. We all understand that many good guys have joined the system for the money and the privileges, however occasionally they are made to regret this decision when faced by the true rotten nature of the system - hence from time to time we hear some faint voices of dissent from within the corrupt cabinet itself. Now the core issue here is all about why suddenly the president is repeatedly growing very nervous by the day as the year 2015 gets closer?ŒæŒæThe truth is that ŒæŒæit's all got to do with whether he can still maintain his precious chair in the No. 1 office amid all the political chaos and economic upheavals the country wide. Initially President Salva Kiir Mayardit intended to pacify any power ambitions within the ruling SPLM byŒæŒæinvesting heavily in one corrupted cabinet after the other. Yet he failed and is now being challenged by his own deputy in what is an open secret. Are you in any way caught by surprise? I hope not. And to further reflect the internal power struggles, as you read these lines the ruling SPLM remains anŒæŒæunregistered party and with no certificate to operate per the RSS political party's act 2012. These are but a few of the chaos brought in by Mr. President in order to dilute any true patriotism in RSS.ŒæŒæHowever in spite of this chaos there is only one way for the president toŒæŒæremain in power and that is through the ballot box. First for the chairmanship of his SPLM party,ŒæŒæthen another in 2015 if he is to dream of another term in office. Any attempt by the president to do otherwise will for sureŒæŒæopen the Pandora box and all the unwanted devils will come down on South Sudan. Remember it was this very president who warned his senior military officers against any coup to topple his government for the fact that the international community will not recognize such a step. Having said thatŒæhe betterŒæalso be quick to understand that the same international community will never continue to tolerate him or his government should he not allow for a free, fair and democratic elections first in his party, then the countryŒæŒæcome 2015. Last but not least the message to the president and the people of South Sudan at largeŒæŒæis that whether it pleases the leadership, plus or minus itsŒæŒæloyalties, the international community is determined to help bring about a democratic transformation in South Sudan. In other words it's all about South Sudan and never about Salva Kiir Mayardit or anyone within his in circles or even the organization.. My fellow compatriots!ŒæŒæIt's for the sake of a better South Sudan, that we must endeavor very hard to seeŒæmany more ministers and senior officials speak out and loud against corruption, impunity and the widespread disrespect of the rule of law. Salvatore Kiir Mayardit can choose to dismiss officials who criticize is corrupted leadership style, but that will only make them appeal more to the electorates come 2015, than being enslaved within a rotten and an ailing system. ŒæŒæYet the true salvation lies beyond party politics and as for now the future of theŒæŒæŒæworn out SPLM party and its crooked leadership are anybody's guess. Author: Justin Ambago Ramba.

President Salva Kiir knows where his cabinet members have gone wrongly. As the ruling party's chairman, he kept encouraging his party members to deliver services to people of South Sudan. He has enough inform of what you are doing! President Kiir in his own words as I quoted, ""we fought for freedom, justice and equality, yet, once we got to power, we forgot what we fought for and began to enrich ourselves at the expense of our people{South Sudan Nation online quotations}.""The war on corruption has started and started my dear comrades. There are times when a father closes his eyes to beat and chase away his good son who usually milk for him his especial cow in the house. I am not declaring that Mr. Kosti Manibe and Deng Alor are sacked or legally probed corrupt. Is it too late for president to started suspending ministers? I am happy but feared to say ""congratulation"" to Mr. President; I shall be quoted against someone who has wronged the nation because our people are currently fighting with truth. Finally, thank you Mr. President for your decision! When money got lost in the president's office, citizens were truly furious and blamed their own sons for being evil to themselves. By the way, should those who are presidential aides and guards claim that the money was stolen by visitors to the president? Many South Sudanese, nearly all of us spent over 20 years without salaries or banked nothing but that shouldn't cause greed for cash to get rich. The president has started sacking individuals after they filched money from his office. Do the high ranked officials think that the president will not remove his hat one day and say one word in many, ""you are suspended...?"" The cash adventure and the nature of individuals in the ministry of finance are frustrating the nation. Sometimes back, the internal reshuffling was done in the ministry of finance leaving others out of the system and now the minister lifted his immunity. Former Finance Minster Mr. Akuein Chol was detained in 2007 but said to have been removed from detention by his people from Aweil but had wrestled with Pagan Amum over millions of dollars financed to party. However, Akuein have had hauled Mr. Amum until the case evaporated invincibly. He {Akuein} seemingly cleared himself. Today, Akuein may laugh at Alor and Manibe due to huge accountability over dollars. If the money was not authorized by the president, other designated senior official, should the ministry of finance transfer the money to company's account without authorization? And if the money is found authorized by the vice president, for instance, but failed to inform the president, should he also be suspended? Besides, the governor of the central bank or senior officials in the bank or the bank itself where transfer was made might has copies of the financial transaction and must be questioned also for transferring money without authorized documents. Yeah, bankers can't give money without proper financial papers if it wasn't a deal. I confused to why some government officials blame the government they serve than striving for change. I wish President Kiir should keep an eye on the officials who usually criticize the government and get them sacked if refused doing their work and started blaming the government. Professor Nyamlel once said that ""the system is rotten to core"" but sacked after found criticizing the government. Why criticize the system than making it better? I don't mind of what Alor and Manibe were trying to buy with the money, but who signed the financial documents? The reality is, when people have served in the government for a quite long time, they may think of doing something big and better for themselves and their children than the nation. On the other hand, our leaders should be committed in their doings and willing to work for the welfare of the ordinary citizens. If there is a person who can't afford a meal in the country that force him/her to beg on the street and there are others who are very rich in the same country but still trying to stash the public money, so what will ordinary citizens say about these people? Is it cleverness, greediness or there are people who wish to own the government and its finances as compensations? Public money in South Sudanese seems to be like holy water where everyone helps himself with it. I wondered when villagers with their briefcase companies tripped to Juba and after a month, some of them used to come back with new cars and huge amount of money in 2008. What did these innocent villagers do to deserve money and cars? Was it a bloody deal between the ministry concerned and the local companies' owners? South Sudanese money is like Ugandan music where everyone in East Africa dances to forget of being alive but unable to compose its tunes. The kostization of millions of dollars into alorization of fire safes business than buying food for the starved families in Jonglei and Torit is the worst exertion done by the ministers if probed guilty of transgression. Let's hope it was a dream - and that the money is in the safe hand to be returned to the government very soon after the investigation. Deng Mangok Ayuel lives in Aweil.

The perception of corruption, if not the absolute reality, has weakened the people's faith and confidence in their leaders. Call it what you want, but this set of problems has brought down many a government in emerging African Nations. The triad of corruption, nepotism and tribalism is a quagmire that stems from an immediate need to put a person in high office who, for whatever reason, has demonstrated either leadership skills, or at least a minimal interest in the designated responsibilities of the office. When you are just getting started, and deadlines loom, at some point you might simply cross your fingers, close your eyes and go for it, sometimes based solely onŒæknown, personalŒæpast history, and reputation. The problem, simply put, is that at the earliest formation of a government in a new country like South Sudan, known past experience is almost certainly based on war and combat skills. These military skills do not necessarily translate to civilian offices. Except when the admirable ability of a bush commander who can scrounge needed weapons, men, or supplies plays out in peacetime applications as criminal ways to scrounge the most money for himself, or place people inŒætheir debt for a job appointment. Corruption can then be a result of the very field skills that prompted the appointment in the first place. One of the problems is that the corrupt civilian official may not really see himself as corrupt at all. He may see his actions as justified, or even necessary, to protect himself, his authority, and the loyalty of his appointed subordinates by sharing the spoils. The spoils of war are a lot different than stealing public funds, but the difference is blurred by the absolute authority often granted to the newly created civilian office holder. However, no matter how a person justifies it, greed is still the motivator. Nepotism is the appointment of family to positions of responsibility, and tribalism is simply an extension of that. Both go back to the same points already described: give the job to somebody you know (family or tribe) and their loyalty to you is assured. AND they will also see ""Sharing the wealth"" as a normal, acceptable practice because, after all, don't you expect gifts on special occasions, from family? The end result is distrust of government in general, and anger at the injustice of it all, as seen by outsiders, who are excluded from the spoils. Enough time has now passed to throw the bums out of office, and appoint successors based on their merits. If you also hold the thief accountable, and prosecute when appropriate, problem solved.

Nguen Nyol July 18, 2013 (SSNA) -- To fight and slightly curb any rampant corruption anywhere in the world required due diligent, political shrewdness and meticulous aggressive policies. As such, an enforcing agent must as well be corruption free in order to ensure that thieves of all breeds face full force of the law accordingly. As oppose to, half-baked political perfectionism is in itself an advancement and endorsement of corruption. South Sudan is no exception in this voyage but part of the whole. However, the reverse is true in my home country, South Sudan. Outright thieves and looting of public funds in a broad day light by the enforcer or man in charge always reigns. For instance, H. E. President Kiir tells the people of South Sudan and the world in the day that his government do not condones and will not tolerates abject corruption while in the cove of the dark, he and his cronies perfected the reverse and therefore blame weak institutions in the country as a pretext to advance false consciousness. The truth is, strong institutions are made by a strong leader in charge, while the weak ones are feeble because the man in charge is weak and corrupted. This is naturally how it works and why South Sudan is corrupted and failing. As usual, I am here to help provide my readers with fresh insight information regarding abject corruption and event of misappropriation of public funds eating South Sudan under the stewardship of President Kiir Mayardit. The commentary will provide evidence of corruption in the presidency and it will also share grounded perspectives on the unconstitutional removal of Unity State governor, Taban Deng on July 7th, 2013 through a presidential decree. First and foremost, I would like to remind my new readers that this is not the first time I have written a commentary about rampant corruption in South Sudan. Indeed, I have done so and pertinent points below are evidences of corruption I have written an article about in the recent past: 1. The $ 3.million dollars (allegedly) caught red-handed from Mr. Stephen Madut Baak at the Heathrow International Airport in London in 2008, where Mr. Baak was unhesitant to mention that he was working for president as an adviser; 2. The $ 4 billion reported missing by none other than President Kiir himself in 2012 and the $ 600 millions reported allegedly stolen by the former RSS minister of finance, Arthur Akuien Chol in 2008; 3. The $ 20 million stolen (allegedly) by Stephen Baak Wuol and $ 293 millions reported by Aaron Young stolen (allegedly) by none other than Salva Mathok Gengdit, the current deputy minister of interior in RSS; 4. And the $ 6 million dollars and South Sudan pounds reported stolen from the president's office 2013; The lamp sum of money unaccounted for in South Sudan and mentioned in my previous commentary is $ 4 billion and $ 922 million dollars. In the recent past however, you might recall, President Kiir has suspended two prominent South Sudanese federal government's ministers on corruption charges, namely Deng Alor Kuol, minister of cabinet affairs and Kosti Manibe, minister of finance and economic planning. Both men were accused of signing off $ 8 million dollars contract to a private business associate without Mr. President's knowledge and approval, which recent evidence of paper trials about the contract suggested something cynical and untrue. For example, prominent figure in the ruling party SPLM and paper trials seen by this writer and published by the South Sudan News Agency presented a gruesome departure and hopeless twist of reality. On July 7th, 2013 for instance, Mr. Pagan Amum accused the president of leaving the ""real culprits"" untouched. Mr. Amum blamed and criticised Mr. President for the suspension of the two ministers and he also asserted that such act was politically motivated. Mr. Amum further explained that the accused Federal ministers were not in any way signatories of the alleged contract which the evidence seen by this author partially contradicts. As such, there is no rebuttal from the president's circle, and therefore such deafening silence speaks to something more cynical which people of South Sudan ought to know. Besides, the newest corruption scheme in the presidency I would like to bring into my readers' attention is the $ 488 million pounds demanded by President Kiir himself on September 5th, 2011. President Kiir ordered $488 pounds to be awarded to ABMC Company without the Council of Ministers' approval. In a nutshell, ABMC Company is a private construction enterprise owned by Benjamin Bol Mel and Mr. President is allegedly a close business associate of the company. Well-placed sources in the presidency and ministry of Road and Bridges revealed that President Kiir personally ordered Minister of Roads and Bridges, Gier Chuang Aluong to release $ 488 million South Sudanese Pounds (244 million dollars) to ABMC Company with immediate effect in 2011. The ABMC Company in this scam was suppose to construct 69 kilometres road under such dubious contract but there is so far little evident proving work done. Because of this suspicious act from the high office of the land, people of South Sudan would like to know why Mr. President ordered the payment of $ 488 million South Sudanese pounds to his business partner without following a proper channel and why he got away with it? Indeed, this is one of many and one of the slightest chucks of rampant corruptions crippling South Sudan under Kiir's leadership. Conversely, this is the second times where the presidency has been implicated into a corruption scheme in Kiir's tenure. The first evident of such sheer corruption was when $ 6 million was reported stolen in the president's office. To give my readers a slightest glimpse of how much money South Sudan has spent on none existing roads construction from 2006 to 2012, the new country has spent $1.7 billion dollars on roads and yet only 75 kilometres road has been constructed and paved. In comparison, the USAID funded 192 kilometers road construction in South Sudan and it was built and paved for $ 229 million dollars only. As evidence suggested, the disparity gap in this regard is real and undeniable, but the gruff manner ensued by the person in charge in our country is categorically appalling. For instance, on April 12th, 2013, President Kiir fired South Sudan Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and International cooperation, Dr. Elias Wako Nyamellel for acknowledging that South Sudan is corrupted and ""rotten to the core."" This is not acceptable move because such act by the president endorsees mode of corruption. Hence, because no one in the government has talked about the alleged $ 488 million pounds awarded to ABMC Company by the president, it showcased that our country is being held hostage by the person in charge and so therefore our country will not move forward.ŒæThus, I questioned our collective allegiance to the nation of which our people have collectively bled and died for. As we helplessly standby, watch and allowed few crooks to milk our country to its death bed is not going to do us good but detrimental and it is our collective inability. Similarly, it portrayed that we are too afraid, too ill informed and too irrational to the core. So much so, our parliament in Juba is also a rubber stamp. The Members of parliament (MP) are too incompetence in discharging their rightful duties to further our nation meaningful progress but in reverse, they became Mr. President's punching bags and puppets. Out of their inabilities and fears, they allowed President Kiir to be the supreme law of the land. No more, no less. As a result, he unlawfully fire public servants, elected governors and allegedly awarded contracts to his business associates as he pleases and at ease. Unfortunately, these are the gruesome realities of a one man rule. This brings me to the unconstitutional removal of Unity State governor, Taban Deng Gai. On July 7th, 2013, H. E. President Kiir Mayardit issued a presidential decree relieving an elected governor of Unity State. Because President Kiir is above the law and does what he pleases, he did not consult with anyone in Unity State, including his Vice President, Dr. Riek. Subsequently, this has generated a lot of political rhetoric at the SPLM's top leadership. Similarly, people of Unity State including its parliament questioned Mr. Taban Deng removal from the governorship. They therefore classified such act as unjustified and also a clear violation of South Sudan Transitional Constitution of which Mr. President has quoted wrongly in this process. Under no circumstance, it is clear that Mr. Deng's removal from governorship is politically motivated.ŒæAs usual, President Kiir was ill-advice, ill-informed and as a result he acted emotionally. For one, Unity State is one of the peaceful States in South Sudan. Since 2011, there has never been major internal unrest in the State which might have led to Mr. Deng's removal. Among the South Sudan States for example, Jonglei is one of the worse provinces regarding internal unrest. Thousands of people died in Jonglei almost daily due to cattle rustling and ethnic conflicts. Unfortunately, Mr. President did not remove its governor, Kuol Manyang Juuk because Mr. Kuol is considered by the president as a staunch ally and supporter tribally. Second, the people of Unity State time and time again have in the past calls on President Kiir to remove Governor Taban Deng from Governorship before Sudan's 2010 elections, but all complains fall into the deaf ear. To be precise, one President Kiir's close associate is on records telling the world that Governor Deng will not be removed from governorship so long Kiir is still in power. This is ugly it has got to in the president's circle, when the people of Unity State complained bitterly about Mr. Deng's misrule in the past. Following 2010 elections however, the people of Unity State swallowed this bitter pill when Governor Taban Deng was declared a winner. In unison, the people of Unity State threw their unwavering supports to their governor without any reservation because justice has prevailed and democracy has spoken, even though there were reported of riggings across South Sudan. Now, it is irrational that President Kiir has violated this covenant at ease and still believes that the people of South Sudan and those of Unity State can still observe and respect his corrupted and distorted leadership.ŒæUnfortunately, I would say this is not how it works Mr. President. In conclusion, I must assert that President Kiir has committed a serious political blunder which might cause him his presidency in the coming years, if and only if he continued to resists good intended counsels. The truth is however, it's still not too late for the president to reconsider his actions. First and foremost, he should immediately allow democratic process to take its course by reversing his decision on Mr. Deng's removal from the governorship. Second, he must allow an open investigation on $ 488 million South Sudanese Pounds alleged he authorized to his business associate, ABMC Company. J.

For the last years, people have been wondering and having focuses only on the seventy five (75) officials that took huge sum of money to foreign Countries for their well fare and nothing have been done about the issue up to date and the issue remain as something sensitive not to be mentioned anyhow by a common citizen because intimidations through text messages and killings are becoming order of the day in this Country. Some people have forgotten the issue because there are no laws that persecute people in this Country due to lack of transparency, integrity and properly accountability in the system of the governance in this Country. I was much assumed and thinking critically at the same time, about the 11,000 ghost officer's names that have been identified in payroll list in the Ministry of Interior in the Republic of South Sudan by the newly appointed Minister. The question that came to my mind was, who are these people putting some ghost names in the payroll list? Are they directors in the Ministry or where are these very people? According to the spokesperson for South Sudan National Police services Col. James Monday yesterday 29th of August 2013 confirm to the press that, following screening exercises the police have uncovered a scum in which 11,000 ghost names where included in force payroll. That mean the all force list in this Country are being increased with fictitious names or names that were put just for the formality of gaining some thing. He also said ""reports show that there was a network operating within the police force between senior officers and cashiers involved in plating the actual strength of the force in order to earn more"" Enoke said. Meanwhile in the media report also the newly Minister of Interior ALeu Anyieny Aleu revealed that screening results pointed that the figure could rise to 27,000 if the investigation confirms the mystery over the additional 16,000 names. Realistically, if you contextualize, visualize the statement from the spokesperson of the South Sudan Police Services and the Minister at the same time, you find that truth have been realized at last unless if they will fair now to dismiss or persecute the culprits who are involved in corruptions in the Ministry. Comprehensive Analysis We all know that the number of police officers is more than expected in the Republic of South Sudan and we know that, they are corrupts in all what Œæthey are doing in this Country. Most of them are the one killing people in Juba City daily due to the fact that most of them need money from the government officials and different employees that work with International Organizations and National Organizations respectively. According to what most people knows is that, police is supposed to keep laws and orders in this Country but not doing something very abnormal that is destroying the image of all South Sudanese people. Police officers have gone out from their mandate as police officers in this nation therefore; serious majors need to be follow critically in order for this great nation to be free from chronic disease known by the name of corruption that is paralyzing most of the government institutions. If such a numbers of ghost names have been identified in one Institution, what of other Institutions in South Sudan? I think there are many ghost names in all Government Institutions in this Country including the ten states. That mean, this country is leading to darkness my dear Countrymen and ladies, facts and realities have to be say here, otherwise if nothing is going to happen to these very people who initiates for these wrongs ideas of getting blood money in such a way, then South Sudan has the Country will be the first failed state in time to come in the all world instead of the fourth failed state according to this year report where this Country had been regarded in that way. Keys recommendations The Minister of Interior should do his best by also identifying more and more so that, he should be confirm well as the Minister after the three months because President Kiir had given the newly appointed Ministers only one hundred (100) days for each and every one of them to have action work plan for the Ministry that he/she run. Minister Aleu should dismiss all the cahiers and Directors Generals who put in all those ghost names in the ministry payroll list because they are the one who did that calculation and strategy of duplicating. And he should appoint the young graduates who have all the skills and energy to do the needful to the people of South Sudan then those very old people who lack good ideas and attitudes as well, because their days are numbered base on the natural call from God the almighty. Minister of Interior should start by arresting all the directors Generals in the Ministry and investigate them properly, and afterward should be persecute for the serious crimes that they have committed in this great nation. Because if no serious action taken about those culprits that mean the newly Minister should also to be investigate of not taken action and he was the one who expose the mess in the Ministry. The Minister of Interior should publicly give the names of the directors and cashiers who are involved in the corruption issues in the Ministry in particular so that, their names can be send online so that, all South Sudanese all over the World should know who they are in South Sudan context. Conclusion; President of the Republic of South Sudan, General Salva Kiir Mayardit, should also take action against the failure of the Minister, incase if he does not bring those people in to book, because truth had been realized now in the Ministry. And if the Minister will continue doing his mandate for the interest of the citizen of South Sudan by arresting those culprits and expose their names to the press, then he deserves to be there until further notices because no job is permanent.

In line with this policy, he recently, suspended two powerful ministers and subsequently referred them for investigations to the toothless anti-corruption. Furthermore, in order to gain trust from the incredulous citizens as well as the international community, he also, suspend two senior officials in his office-namely Mayen Wol his Chief Administrator and a certain Yel Luol, his Executive Secretary-who were also referred to the very same redundant Anti-Corruption for stolen funds in the highest office in the new republic. While the dismissal of the two ministers has caused some fiasco in the SPLM political fiber, and the suspension of the two corrupt officials in his office was lauded, their secret reinstatement, though mysterious, still needs to be challenged. The institution of the presidency, the beacon of state sovereignty, by law, remains unaudited, neither by the auditor general nor the parliament. It is this institutional shield from accountability that the two ""syndicated corruptees"" -Mayen and Yel-are extremely exploiting in order to shamelessly and unflinchingly enrich themselves In perfecting their looting skills, the dynamic duo of Mayan Wool and Yelp Lou, has by design, instituted a flawed labyrinth bureaucracy and a very sophisticated scheme of siphoning money out of the country. The Plan Firstly, about a year ago the country irresponsibly set up itself by shutting down its oil production and in the process depriving itself 90 percent of its income. As reality hit and times became though, in order for the government to sustain its activities, it had no choice other than borrowing. In this, Mayen Wol-the scavenger-saw an opportunity to make money, so he first convinced the President, that, his contact, he needed to be included in the loan negotiation team, and then fought much harder to head the economic team, though a lawyer himself. Being from Warrap-the president's hometown-his wish was of course granted. The first stop over for borrowing loans was Dubai, UAE, where the team meet some reputable creditors who willingly offered to loan the Government of the Republic of South Sudan eight hundred million dollars-yes!-U$D 800, 000, 000 at an interest rate of 4.5% per annum. That interest alone is high, but since Mayen needed to get his cut, he violated the negotiation tactic, by having a one on one side meeting with the head of the prospective creditor. Since their was no way to accommodate his interest, it had to be included in the general interest rate. After his discussion the interest rate hiked to 8.5% per annum, when confronted by the rest of the team, he blatantly lied and intimidated them by saying he had to accommodate the president's cut-by working in the office of the president, and his proximity to the Chief Executive of the nation, this is a perfect ruse-which he and Yel Luol has used time and again. In South Sudan, the institution of the Presidency is sacrosanct, and therefore anybody could concoct any lie, corrupt the system and even pervert justice and get away with it as long as they can somehow convince his audience that he is acting in the name of the president. So as we speak, the some of 36 million U$D which accounts for the extra 4% added to the original 4.5% was wired to Mayen's offshore account set up in Malaysia. As if he had not learnt from his suspension, immediately after being re-instated, Mayen has again been involved in fraudulent activities. Just a month ago, he invited one of his in-laws, a gold digger by the name of Manon Dut Anyakdit-the first ever Dinka man to be married by a woman-to set up a company and, without following procurement laws, offered him the contract to purchase a fleet of 70 vehicles, consisting only of Toyota land cruisers and 60th edition of Nissan, each vehicle invoiced at the cost of 180, 000 U$D. This amount is double the actual market price; but, that is even beside the point, what is more depressing is the fact with a little over three months after resumption of oil sales and a few months to get out of the austerity measures-assuming things remain constant both economically and politically with the north-it would not be difficult to know that the president's protocol vehicle are not the priority. Without notifying the President, both Mayen and Yel have insisted the the vehicles have to be procured at all cost. The math indicates that the actual amount of the vehicles is six million and three hundred thousand, but instead they are billing the government twice that amount which is twelve million and six hundred thousand. This, according to both Mayen Wol and Yel Luol, is a good way of making quick money before the president fills in the vacant post of the Minister in the Office of the President. Poor Manon Dut Anyakdit, the scam who was paid by his father in law to marry his daughter, is only a facilitator who is taking the brunt of the complication only to be paid a commission. Well, the question that must be asked is if Mayen and Yel are so corrupt why are they still serving the president? Well, the reason the escaped unscathed by the recently concluded investigation and charges brought against them is because according to the terms of reference set out to the Anti- Corruption investigators was a one month timeline which actually falls outside the days in which this major crimes did take place. And that explains why the reason their suspension was a public announcement via presidential decree and their re-instatement was so secretive. If the President is serious and genuine about fighting corruption, then he must start with his office. But if he abstains from the applying the rules when those implicated happened to be from his own home town of Warrap-like Mayen Wol and Yel Luol-then he must be sending the wrong signal to this very diverse nation of ours. The two criminals-Mayen Wol and Yel Luol-must be reprimanded for their scandalous acts if the president's war on corruption is to be regarded authentic and original. Application and referrals of corrupts elements to Anti-Corruption cannot be selective, it should be comprehensive, failure to observe that means the president's war on corruption could merely be political posturing. South Sudan cannot bankroll Mayen and Yel.

Now is that time, when after a week of a very defaming, embarrassing, belittling and arrogant article with the above title was written by a Kenyan citizen and subsequently published by his media came into public domain both in Kenya and South Sudan and no citizen from my country took the courage to refute such falsehood. I felt obliged to response to these malicious and useless allegations by the so-called Miguna Miguna. For those who might have come across such article, there is no useless thing that Miguna has not said about South Sudan starting with the government, people and even individuals. He made all the flagrant mockery of our leaders and our people using all the vocabulary that he has and one begins to wonder whether he was talking about South Sudan or a different country. From the very onset for those who have read his article, you must have realized that there is a very wider disconnect between the title and the content of Miguna Miguna article. For instance, the title as it appears above was about 'corruption and tribalism as the root cause of crisis in South Sudan' BUT Miguna Miguna due to his epileptic condition turned to talk about the '9th July, 2011 Independence day organization'. This truly shows the malice intentions Miguna Miguna had against South Sudan as a nation and against the citizens of South Sudan as people. Not only that, again due to his paranoia, Miguna Miguna said and I Quote 'On December 3rd, 2013, South Sudanese President, Salva Kiir Mayardit, sensationally claimed that he had quashed a coup attempt by his former Vice-President Dr. Riek Machar, when many knew that Kiir was only trying to consolidate his iron hold on power ahead of what many South Sudanese expected to be a remarkable ruling party leadership convention a few days away.' Which calendar date is not true because in my recollection of events as they unfolded and as a citizen of South Sudan and someone who was in Juba when the crisis happened, 'President Kiir only talked about the foiled coup attempt in the afternoon of December 16, 2013 and not 3rd as alleged by Mr. Miguna? This shows Miguna is operational on hearsays or even more on contractual basis to extent the falsehoods fabricated by the enemies of peace and stability in South Sudan. These are some of the few explicit mismatches that I can identified for you in his article but if you read through his whole article, you will find out that the man did not know what he was talking about. For those who may not know Miguna Miguna, He is a man who is vast known for his controversies and conman behaviors starting from many years in Canada where he claimed to have been practicing law to the recent intricacies in the Kenyan politic between him and his employer Raila Amollo Odinga where he fabricated numerous falsehoods about Mr. Odinga in his book 'Peeling Back the Mask: A Quest for Justice in Kenya'. ABook that eventually tends to be different from its title as he largely tends to talk about Raila Odinga instead of comprehensive coverage of the injustices in Kenya. Just to be precise, when Miguna Talked about the poor organization of the 9th July, 2011 independence day celebration he had this to say and I quote 'Although the inauguration had been planned for a long period of time, they hadn't even constructed a mini-stadium for the event in the five years they had been in power under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Not had they thought of hiring a large tent for the occasion if they couldn't construct a stadium. The event was embarrassingly held at the Dr. John Garang de Mabior Mausoleum.' This was out of the many quotes but as you also read a bit ahead to his article, here comes another contradictory quote from crazy Miguna Miguna and I Quote 'There was a huge white tent behind the Mausoleum, which was reserved for VIP lunch after the event. Surprisingly, the place was being run by the Ethiopian wife of a South Sudanese cabinet minister. All the waiters, cooks and servers inside that tent were Ethiopian. When we inquired why, we were shocked to learn, from a South Sudanese, that South Sudanese don't like working.' Now, studying very critically the two quotes and I hope Miguna Miguna himself got to read this response, where he and many of us will find out that, there were indeed tents and many other arrangements were in place and not as portrayed by Devil advocate Miguna Miguna. However, the bottom line here and all of us need to know is that, when South Sudanese were celebrating independence on 9th July, 2011, it was not to showcase what we had in term of material wealth but it was purposely to let the world know that, at last, we have our identity, our sovereignty, our own country and indeed our own image and that is exactly what was being celebrated on that day and not sitting in modern stadiums , eating barbecues, drinking Royal wines, wearing Italian suites and what have you etc... On individual level, here is what I quoted from Miguna Miguna 'First, there were no acknowledgements, even from President Salvar Kiir, of regional leaders like Moi who had played pivotal roles in their independence. No mentions and no opportunity to address the gathering.' Now, in this case, you could sense that Miguna Miguna emotions were overclouding his judgments because if this is not the case, then how many times have the people of South Sudan through their leadership led by President Kiir been thanking the people of Kenya and Moi in particular for ushering in the peace in South Sudan. Do Kenyans and Miguna Miguna in particular want South Sudanese to licks their feet in order for them to acknowledge that we have paid and have indeed given enough appreciation for whatever debts we owed to them and other foreigners who claim credit for our independence? I think we have paid enough for our independence and it is time Kenyans, foreigners and Miguna Miguna in particular leave us alone. Finally, unlike Miguna Miguna who doesn't appreciate any little effort that comes from someone, I feel that, the last beats of his opinion are needed if we want everlasting peace to prevail in South Sudan. As South Sudanese, we need to protect the image of our country because the foreigners even those who pretend to be our friends when here are not what they tend to be when they are back to their countries and I learnt a lot during these crisis when I went to Kenya and I could watch on the Kenyan media particularly on the television some Kenyans who were successfully evacuated shamelessly claiming that their colleagues were looted, rapped and some killed and here one is left to wonder how a dead person could still give testimonies of such nature . Miguna Miguna is a true reflection of what many Kenyans and foreigners say about South Sudan and South Sudanese once they are in their countries. I am not calling for xenophobia but South Sudanese need to watch out. What pains me most is the hardship I had to undergo explaining to Kenyans that Foreigners were the savers people in South Sudan even at the backdrop of the skirmishes that unfolded in South Sudan. Kindly, circulate this response to all the media houses including that of Kenya.

If we are vulnerable to our ethnical and political deeds, is it easy to get federalize or have a real functional system of government we deserve in South Sudan? And who are the ones calling for federalism? The old boys who initiated and implemented kokora in 1980s? Same people in the same government who corruptly tainted our resources for years? Our problem in South Sudan is not about the system of government - call it absolutism, abstractionism, centralism, federalism, Afrocentrism, or whatever. The main issue is the nature of our politicians, political consortium within the same party and individuals' powers in political game. It's also about the competition within the ruling party, greed for leadership by political subordinates and tribalism. Federal government system instigated by the same people who have run the government of our country like their property could turn the entire country into one colossal political camp for dignitaries, believe me. The so-called federal system, if allowed shall be the government of people for the leaders and by the leaders because they like it. They know what they will gain from it. I don't deter the principles of federalism but why was it initiated by kokoratists and renegades in the country? Will federal system stop us from recruiting more white army and manthiang-anyor across the states in South Sudan? This government shouldn't row its people like a boat in the Nile. People are starving to death in the villages and camps, yet our people kept preaching what shall benefit them in the long run. I am just curious. Why do we need a federal government? And why can't politicians allow ordinary citizens to decide for the system of government which is good for them? I partially agree with Bahr el Ghazal youths who opposed federal system of government. These individuals, who called themselves Bahr el Ghazal youths are encouraged to individualize their political issues than generalizing the youths whose ideas, grievances in the states of greatest Bahr el Ghazal have never been listened to for years. According to the youths, federal system of government will lead to insecurity or increase rebellion in the country. The youth has also stated that federal government has failed in Africa {Nigeria, Ethiopia} and has been the key factor affecting the federal system in Africa. However, federal system shouldn't be political dogmatism in the baby nation. And who are federalists - uncle Konga, Equatoria MPs and Dr Machar's political camp? When there is a crocodile in the river, nobody is comfortable whilst swimming. I don't believe federal system didn't work in Nigeria and Ethiopia, oppositely making it inevitable in South Sudan. Federal system of government shall work in South Sudan after sometimes when the country is politically stable. Federal system is not kokora but can be kokoratize if initiated by kokoratists. The call for federal government has never been initiated by Equatorians alone as put by Jacob K. Lupai in his article titled, federal system of government in South Sudan not kokora. There is no pastor who is supposed to claim that Jesus Christ has appeared to him in a dream, that he is the only one preaching the Bible well than million of preachers in the country. If kokora was started by Equatorians in Equatoria and badly affected people from Bhar el Ghazal and Upper Nile, thereafter, will federal government work well under Equatorians initiatives? I urge those who are seriously whisking up for federal system of government to give it a pause. Federal system which was proposed and opposed may cause another problem among the youths in the country when political opinions daunt and repel regionally.

Boum Makur has entrenched a strong Criminal networking in the Ministry of Roads and Bridges. It is advisable to investigate corruption established by this self-proclaimed Consultant Engineer. Everyone is disappointed to see this looming corruption in this useful infrastructure Ministry. Government is wasting million of USD to maintain the roads in Bhar el Ghazal yearly. It was reported that the Managing Director of Eyat for Roads and Bridges purchased a gorgeous house in Omdurman to a functional illiterate called Boum Andrew Makur. The cost of this beautiful building is two Million USD as bribery to him.Eyat also authorized his resident Engineers in Wau to building seven storey building as a part of deal. The reliable sources in Eyat for Road and Bridges revealed to us that Boum was given more than Forty Five Millions South Sudanese Pounds to issue ""Fictitious Certificates of Completion"" to Eyat. To offer or provide payment in order to persuade someone with a responsibility to betray that responsibility is known as seeking Undue influence over that person's actions. When someone with power seeks payment in exchange for certain actions, that person is said to be peddling influence. Regardless of who initiates the deal, both parties to an act of bribery can be found guilty of the crime independently of the other.The Ministry of Road and Bridges has constitutional obligation to sue the so called Eng Boum Makur and Eyat for Road and Bridges to the Court of Law. The engineering design and building of these four houses in Juba cost Eyat 23,000,000 SSP. It is also imperative to understand that Boum was seriously involved in Wau International Airport scandal with Briefcase Company of Adim Adim. It was reported that Eight (8) Land Cruiser V8 and Thirty Million South Sudanese Pounds were handed over to Boum Makur as bribery to facilitate the process of Contract with Ministry of Transport. I am urging the leadership of the Ministry of Roads and Bridges to review the contract specifications of the Wau international airport and take a necessary legal action against the culprits. We can provide the Ministry with all authenticate documents. Africa Kongdai Roads, Bridges and Investment Co.Ltd was supposed to construct 153 kilometers road from Aweil - Aroyo. Eng Boum and the Managing Director Lual Aguer agreed to turn this contractor to 320 kilometers. I am urging the legal adviser in the Ministry of Roads and Bridges to reactivate the case and bring these criminals to justice. The Ministry of Roads and Bridges should investigate the criminal activities of Eng Boum Makur and imprison him. He is tarnishing the image of out Ministry."434,The Star,3/1/2012,How Do We Fight Corruption in Our Country?

He had been in the cells for almost two hours. Before then, he was driven around town for another two hours. It was now 4pm and he was nowhere near being acquitted. When the judge read the fines, he had thought it was all over. He was just going to pay up and leave the stinking cells. He was wrong! The court room was filled to capacity. My friend thought probably there were some prominent personality arrested and the people had come to listen to the case. But after the charges were read and fines given, he noticed that people from the gallery were the ones going to the paying desk to clear the fines for their relatives and friends. All the accused were pushed back to the overflowing cell. My friend had no time to even ask how he could get to his wallet and pay the fine. When he tried to talk to the officer in charge, he was ruthlessly kicked on his face and fell inside the cell. As he struggled to stand up, he heard some people pleading with the officer not to hit him again because he did not know the rules. The officer instructed the pleading inmates to fill my friend in, on the procedures. And so, my friend was educated thus; ""once you have surrendered your belongings at the front desk, your fate is good as sealed. You can only get them, if you actually do, when you are officially released. If you have to, under special circumstances, you have to bribe the officer controlling the cell door by asking him to pick up some money from the wallet. Since he can pick up more and get away with it, then it was prudent to give your wallet to someone else before you get into the cell, or call a friend from outside to come and pay the fine for you. That was the reason for the courtroom to fill up with people coming to bail out their friends"". Now he knew, the hard way. He was doomed one way or the other. He did not have his phone either. So he had to bribe to get his phone. He was so afraid to talk to the officer so he asked one of the cell mates to ask on his behalf. Shockingly, the person he asked to plead for him had his own phone with him inside the cell. He seemed to know his way around pretty well. Instead of asking the officer to retrieve my friend's phone, he offered to use his own to call me. I responded immediately to my friend's call. After living in this God-forsaken city for 20 years, I have a pretty clear idea of the excesses of the system. I knew my friend was suffering. I also knew from experience that I will need more than the Sh3,000 required. So I went to the ATM and got more cash and rushed to the city courts. I paid up the fine for my friend and presented the papers to the relevant authorities who told me to wait. I knew what the waiting was all about, but I was prepared. After half an hour of waiting, an officer came to me and told me that the offices were closing and my friend will have to spend the night in the cells. The next day was a Saturday. My friend was to stay the whole weekend in the cells until Monday. I did not even need to listen to him. I knew the drill. I had to work overtime to make sure my friend does not spend the weekend in the cells for dropping a bus ticket on the streets. At six in the evening, my friend walked out of the cells to freedom, with all his belongings. To this day, he has never visited the courtroom again. Not because he stopped working, but because he had to adapt to the system. Corruption is worse than prostitution. While prostitution corrupts the morals of an individual, corruption deals in morals of a whole society. How do we fight the monster? Please contribute your thoughts."435,The Star,3/1/2012,Rights Groups Press for Anti-Corruption Director to Be Appointed,,KENYA (93%),,Newspaper,Justus Ochieng,ENGLISH,,30-Mar-12,,421 words,CORRUPTION (94%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (91%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); APPROVALS (90%); APPOINTMENTS (90%); POLITICS (89%); ETHICS (78%); ELECTIONS (78%); HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS (73%); HUMAN RIGHTS (73%); PETITIONS (66%) Kenya; Corruption; NGOs and Civil Society,"CIVIL society activists have raised concerns over the delay by Parliament to approve a new anti-corruption director. The rights groups said they sense a sinister motive in the delay and asked Parliament to move with speed and give Kenyans a new Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission boss. The National NGO Council has also called for fast tracking of the full constitution of EACC to address corruption in the country. Last year, House Speaker Kenneth Marende ruled that rejection of a parliamentary team's report did not amount to approval of the three nominees of President Kibaki to the commission. The Parliamentary Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs had recommended the names of Mumo Matemu, Jane Onsongo and Irene Keino be rejected because the trio ""lacked the passion"" to fight corruption. Yesterday, NGO council treasurer Haggai Kadiri, Ken Wafula and a member of the Kisumu County NGO Network James Oduor said the delay in the appointment of the anti-corruption boss is aimed at undermining Chapter Six of the constitution that addresses leadership and integrity. Speaking in Kisumu, Kadiri said: ""Politicians are fearing that the clause on leadership and integrity may lock them out of the next elections and have vowed to derail the EACC mandate that is likely to bar them from contesting."" He pointed out that the civil societies were concerned about the chapter adding that they have but in place mechanisms to ensure they sensitize the public to reject leaders who are tainted with corruption. ""We want to ensure that all the aspirants in various positions meet the requirements of chapter six that speaks on leadership and integrity. We however, recognize the need for full establishment of a robust anticorruption body to spearhead the same,"" added Kadiri. He pointed out that they would petition the IEBC, office of the ombudsman, the human rights commission and the courts to bar leaders enmeshed in corruption as a constitutional requirement. In Nyanza he pointed out that they will first focus in Kisumu County and move to other counties. Wafula noted that it won't be business as usual for politicians named in various reports like the Ndung'u land report, Akiwumi, Kiliku and NCCK report on tribal clashes, the Waki commission of PEV, Ouko murder, Goldenberg, Anglo leasing, Triton, Kombo's list of shame and the TJRC report in their political career. ""They should come on and clear their names as we are set to mobilize members of the public to reject them at the ballot as per the new constitution,"" he added."436,The Star,4/1/2012,Corruption Probe Shuts Eldoret South CDF Office,,KENYA (79%),,Newspaper,Mathews Ndanyi,ENGLISH,,30-Apr-12,,430 words,CORRUPTION (91%); ETHICS (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); EMBEZZLEMENT (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (73%); ROAD & BRIDGE MAINTENANCE (65%) Kenya; Corruption,"The Eldoret South Constituency Development Fund office has stopped operations after the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission confiscated more files following the directive by the Director of Public Prosecutions that the area MP Peris Simam should be charged in connection with the embezzlement of CDF money. Supporters of the MP have, however, rushed to defend her, accusing the commission of engaging in a witch hunt. Most CDF officials in the area have kept away from the office and declined to comment on the matter. EACC spokesperson Nicholas Simani confirmed last week that the commission, through its Eldoret Office, was handling the case against the MP. Yesterday, youth from the area led by Paul Ruto said they were angered by decision by the EACC because CDF records for the constituency were clear and that the MP was not involved in handling the money. The MP has not commented on the matter. EACC officials have been carrying out the probe in the area since last year when six other CDF officials were charged but later released after the court ordered that the commission should take over the matter. Investigators confiscated files over the alleged loss of Sh600,000 for Langas Primary School among other irregularities. EACC has also investigated the loss of more than Sh11 million meant for the improvement of rural access roads in the area. Investigators seized files concerning the construction of Saruiyot Bridge where more than Sh490,000 went missing. Two other CDF officials in the area had already recorded statements on the issue. A section of residents of the constituency presented documents to EACC indicating that money allocated for the roads during the 2009/2010 financial year was allegedly misused. Official documents from the CDF office indicate that the roads were done but residents complained that they had never seen any work going on the roads. The roads in question include Kerita-Chepkongony, which was allocated Sh600,000 for grading; Emugwen-Chebolol, which was allocated Sh500,000 for culverts; and Lessos-Chepkitiny, on which Sh732,000 was to be used on bridges. Other roads include Kapkoi-Ketiplong (Sh700,000), Tuiyo-Nganiat Bridge (Sh700,000), Kaptienyi-Kosirai (Sh600,000), Bayete-Kabyiemit (Sh650,000), Sachangwan-Chakaiya (Sh600,000) and Kaplelach-Barekeiywo (Sh766,000). EACC also probed the use of Sh750,000 on Kapkoi-Lelmokwo road and another Sh700,000 on Kerita-Chepkitiny road. The Kapngetunyi-Lingwai road, where Sh800,000 was to be used, and the Inder-Tuiyo road were also cited in the complaint forwarded to EACC by area residents."437,The Star,4/1/2012,Fight Against Corruption Not Possible Without EACC - Wamalwa,,KENYA (93%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%); AFRICA (79%),,Newspaper,Brian Otieno,ENGLISH,,24-Apr-12,,280 words,CORRUPTION (94%); ETHICS (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (78%); BUSINESS EDUCATION (73%); CATHOLICS & CATHOLICISM (68%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (68%) Kenya; Corruption,"A fresh motion seeking to have the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission set-up will soon be brought to Parliament. Justice minister Eugene Wamalwa said on Thursday that the fight against graft in the country will not be possible unless the process of forming the commission is expedited. ""There is an urgent need to have the commission up and running in order to move forward in the fight against corruption,"" said Wamalwa. He said his predecessor Mutula Kilonzo had started a good job but ""some issues"" emerged and forced the process to stall. In December, the Parliamentary Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs rejected three nominees to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission as they were deemed not to have the ""passion"" to fight graft. The three were Mumo Matemu a former commissioner with the Kenya Revenue Authority, Prof Jane Kerubo Onsongo a lecturer at the Catholic University of Eastern Africa who once served as an assistant director of preventive services in the now defunct Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission, and Irene Cheptoo Keino who holds a masters degree in Business Administration and is an estate manager with the National Cereals and Produce Board. ""The nominees lacked the passion, initiative and the drive to lead the fight against corruption in this country,"" stated the committee in a report tabled by vice chairman Njoroge Baiya who is MP for Githunguri. On Thursday, Wamalwa accused the political class of lacking the political will to fight graft in the country, a situation he said he is determined to change.

This, according to the Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko, has negated the fight against corruption. ""We must have a substantive appointee to that crucial office of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and also expedite the appointment of other directors. But Parliament is dragging its feet on this crucial institution for work to go overdrive,"" said Tobiko. Treasury PS Joseph Kinyua also hit out at the MPs saying: ""I have been labouring to explain to MPs how the legislature works."" Parliament last December rejected President Kibaki's and Prime Minister Raila Odinga's nominees to the EACC. They were Prof Mumo Matemu, Prof Onsongo and Irene Keino, who previously served in the defunct Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission advisory board. Concerns surrounding Matemu's nomination emerged after Ikolomani MP Boni Khalwale tabled documents indicating that he had credibility issues while serving at the Kenya Revenue Authority. MPs then rejected the appointment of the three nominees, saying 'they lack the passion and initiative to spearhead the fight against graft.' Yesterday, Kinyua warned that all arms of the government must work together so that the war against corruption could be won. The duo spoke at the Nairobi mayor's official residence in Lavington, which the EACC gave back to City Hall after a protracted court battle that eventually saw former Cabinet minister Katana Ngala relinquish the house. Tobiko, however, warned that the house was not given back voluntarily, but that Ngala was ""forced by the law to give it back to the council"". ""Grabbers of public utility should be warned that it is not absolute immunity if they return the property. Cases will be reviewed on merit and sentences will be meted on others,"" he said. Tobiko said his office will support amnesty on some cases as they save the taxpayer the expensive road of litigation. Ngala had been charged together with his wife Isabel Nzalambi and former mayor John Ndirangu. They surrender the house after a five-year court battle. Town clerk Philip Kisia, however, urged that Ngala should not be demonised, saying he was just a victim of circumstances, as many other individuals were beneficiaries of allotments in the Moi regime. Kisia thanked Kinyua, who said Treasury will fund the renovation of the house, which the mayor is set to occupy in the next couple of weeks."439,The Star,4/1/2012,Anti Corruption Team to Hand Over Mayoral House to City Hall,,KENYA (96%),,Newspaper,Stephene Sangira,ENGLISH,,11-Apr-12,"NAIROBI, KENYA (94%)",395 words,CORRUPTION (92%); ETHICS (90%); MAYORS (90%); CITIES (90%); CITY GOVERNMENT (90%); AGREEMENTS (89%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (89%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (78%); TREASURY DEPARTMENTS (77%); MAGISTRATES (74%); LAWYERS (71%); HOTELS & MOTELS (68%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (65%); EXECUTIVES (56%) Kenya; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission is set to officially hand over the Nairobi Mayor's residence to City Hall. The house, situated on Issac Gathanju Road in Lavington Estate, was recovered from the wife of former Lands minister Noah Katana Ngala who was accused of acquiring it irregularly. The last city mayor to live in the house was Nathan Kahara in 1983. In a letter to town clerk Philip Kisia, EACC acting chief executive Jane Muthaura said the commission would hand over the property to the council on April 17 at a public function. ""The property is the official residence of the mayor of Nairobi thus of immense benefit to the nation, and the residents of the County of Nairobi. ""Its illegal acquisition took away these benefits and also occasioned the government to spend public funds to secure an alternative accommodation for the Mayor of Nairobi,"" reads part of the letter. Muthaura adds that the commission is gratified to surrender the property to the council through the Treasury PS in accordance with the provisions of section 56C of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act. Ngala's wife entered into an agreement with the government to hand back the house to the City Council of Nairobi through the EACC. In a consent recorded at the High Court, Mrs Isabella Vicky Nzalambi paid Sh2 million in three equal instalments to the council in rent arrears from the house. The agreement was signed by lawyer Francis Gikonyo for Kenya Anti Corruption Commission and Nzalambi's lawyer Katwa Kigen. Ngala and Nzalambi faced criminal charges at the magistrate's court over the acquisition of the house. The former minister had been accused of making false representations that he owned the property. He allegedly transferred the house to his wife. The offences were committed between February 1993 and June 2002. Mayor George Aladwa said yesterday that he had visited the house last month and it needs renovation before he moves in. ""The anti-corruption commission must be commended for recovering the mayors official residence, as it has been difficult for me and other mayors before me to host visiting delegations for garden parties. ""Whenever am out of the country on official business, my counterparts in the major cities that I visit always hosts me in their residences, but when they visit the council is always forced to host them in hotels,"" Aladwa said on phone."440,The Star,5/1/2012,Why Corruption Is Not an Option,,KENYA (93%),,Newspaper,Pheroze Nowrojee,ENGLISH,,1-Jun-12,,770 words,CORRUPTION (91%); POLITICS (89%); RULE OF LAW (89%); MISAPPROPRIATION (78%); BRIBERY (78%); ELECTIONS (76%) Kenya; Corruption,"Every alternate day newspapers headline the corrupt disappearance of hundreds of millions of shillings of public money. We never hear of the corrupt misappropriation of similar huge sums from the private sector. What is the purpose of corruption in Kenya ? Why does grand corruption continue ? To whom is it useful? Some of the usual purposes of corruption are, obviously, personal enrichment, covering past crimes, financing elections, rewarding compliant subordinates, widening patronage, bringing about legal short cuts. All of these, and other, reasons play a part, either together or by themselves in making corruption useful. But the deep-rooted persistence of corruption, the acceptance of it as partially legitimate, and the absence of any effective moral condemnation from the religious sectors, point to some over-arching factor that can survive for fifty years and is not dependent on particular individuals. This factor is that corruption is the key means of obtaining and retaining power in our country. Corruption therefore includes a wider use of improper means than only money. Corruption does not only mean illegally obtained money, or illegally given money. It also means the improper use of processes, rights, information and force. It includes the improper denial of those same processes and rights to others. It includes illegally obtaining a judgment, or illegally obtaining the termination of a person's job, or the improper taking of the land of others. The consequence of this wider corruption is not only that we break the commitment of applying public moneys to public development, we also break the institutions of development themselves. We corrupt the concept of Government itself. So the next effect of grand corruption is the corruption of the purpose for which we, the electorate, have given a mandate to our rulers. The mandate was to provide solutions to our problems. But our rulers for fifty years have considered the purpose of power is simply to perpetuate themselves in power. The effect of this, and the third danger of such corruption therefore, is that public moneys are again being concentrated in a few private hands. When grand corruption is prevalent, we find that the concentration of money and the concentration of power come to be in the same few hands. There is a direct connection. The temptations of continual power are irresistible. The human mind can fashion limitless rationales for this. The fourth danger then, in such an environment, is that instead of the Rule of Law another rule prevails: that politics has no rules. The Rule of Law then does not extend to politics, or to the obtaining or the retention of political power. The result is that lawlessness prevails heavily in the political arena. Corruption is thusone of the major responses of insecure holders of power. For such small groups holding insecure power, corruption is a necessary means. Therefore corruption will not disappear by treating it as a law and order issue as bribery, or by more and more legislation, or by increasing financial or custodial penalties. The practical deterrent is barring convicted persons from holding any public office. Allowing the use of both illegitimate and legitimate means to obtain or retain power will result, as it had, in institutional government being forever weak and the Rule of Law failing. The Constitution says our rulers are accountable for corrupt losses. The practice is that they are not, or not enough, yet. Such political schizophrenia causes the same illness in a country as in an individual. And living in an ill country eventually brings about the fifth danger: it demeans our humanity and brings about an indifference to inhumanity that is itself the biggest corruption of us as individual Kenyans. Therefore, the full implementation of the new Constitution's changes is necessary. Because blocking the implementation of the Constitution returns unrestricted power into the hands of one man - exactly what we fought against for decades. Those who want unchecked power after the elections continue to practice corruption. Most of all, the lesson of history is that the alternative to corruption must not disappear from the choice of Kenyans. The alternative, fortunately, is the new Constitution. The task of its steady and full implementation must continue. So the choice we have in the coming elections is: Which candidate will best implement all the remaining parts of the new Constitution? Which candidate will best steer the country to the future the Constitution safeguards for us? Which candidate fought for the new Constitution and its Promulgation?"441,The Star,5/1/2012,Now Let the Fight Against Corruption Resume [editorial],,KENYA (92%),,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,,13-May-12,,328 words,CORRUPTION (91%); OIL EXPLORATION (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); ETHICS (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); APPROVALS (78%); HOSPITALS (76%); MINING & EXTRACTION RIGHTS & ROYALTIES (74%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (73%); OIL & GAS EXPLORATION (73%); OIL & GAS INDUSTRY (72%); CLINICS & OUTPATIENT SERVICES (71%) Kenya; Corruption,"On Thursday this week, parliament approved the list of top officials who are to serve in the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, ending a months-long stalemate which had crippled the operations of this all-important commission. We should note that during this period, there have been a number of new scandals emerging, all of which require the urgent attention of the EACC. Among these is the question of how the National Hospital Insurance Fund ended up disbursing hundreds of millions of shillings to so-called medical services providers, which had barely begun to set up their national network of clinics and hospitals. Indeed some of these organisations which have been absorbing public funds are so shady, that not even their ownership can be clearly established. Then there is a large grey area already, about the manner in which oil prospecting blocks are being auctioned off. And there is at least one case of a Kenyan-based company, which has no history of being in the oil business, having somehow obtained drilling rights which it then sold off at a huge profit to those who actually do know something about oil prospecting. With time, there can only be more and more cases of such dubious business deals, which require the attention of the EACC. So this is not the time for nitpicking over the small print of the histories and backgrounds of the people who will head this institution, when they have already gone through a comprehensive and public vetting process. If indeed there is any reason why a particular technocrat is not worthy of the position he has been cleared for, this will no doubt be made clear in due course, and can be dealt with in the fullness of time. But for now, what matters most is that we should have a fully-staffed EACC, ready to get to work, and dedicated to investigating the many shady deals that have already been identified, as well as the many more which will no doubt come up in time, as we go into the election campaign period."442,The Star,5/1/2012,LSK Faults Contracts for 63 Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission Officers,,KENYA (91%),,Newspaper,Mosoku Geoffrery,ENGLISH,,13-May-12,,432 words,ETHICS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS (90%); ENERGY & UTILITY LAW (78%); EXECUTIVES (78%); APPOINTMENTS (78%); LAWYERS (74%); TALKS & MEETINGS (73%); APPROVALS (73%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (73%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (71%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (69%) Kenya; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"The Public Service Commission has renewed contracts of 63 officers of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission whose contracts expired last week. Justice and Constitutional Affairs PS Gichira Kibara wrote to the EACC caretaker head Jane Muthaura stating that the officers will continue serving in their positions following the PSC decision. Yesterday, PS Gichira confirmed the decision to extend the term of the officers saying that the contracts were renewed and took effect as from 2nd May. The Law Society of Kenya chairman Eric Mutua protested the renewal of the contracts saying it was a violation of the law as any officer working for the commission must reapply for employment subject to vetting. The LSK protest letter to the PSC was also copied to Attorney General Githu Muigai, CIC chairman Charles Nyachae and Ombudsman Oteinde Amolo. Mutua said the same law was used to eject former director P.L.O.Lumumba and his assistants Dr John Mutonyi and Pravin Bowry. The provisions of the same Act were also applied when the KACC advisory committee led by Okong'o O'Mogeni vacated their offices 90 days after the Act commenced. ""Why should the law be applied selectively? Its the CIC which inserted the provision for vetting of the officer since there were many complaints,"" Mutua added. Justice PS Gichira defended the decision to renew the officers terms saying they will still undergo vetting. ""There is no one breaking the law here since the officers will be subjected to vetting. The PSC is mandated by the Constitution to hire state officers for independent commissions,"" Gichira said. The PSC secretary Bernadette Nzioki was not available for comment as she was said to be hold up in a day long board meeting. The International Centre for Policy and Conflict executive director Ndung'u Wainaina said the PSC had no powers to hire the EACC officers without following the stipulated procedure. The CIC chairman Nyachae said he was aware of the LSK protest letter and his commission was studying the developments before issuing a statement later. Education Minister Mutula Kilonzo who was transferred from the Justice docket defended the PSC decision saying the EACC needed to retain its institutional memory. ""Imagine a situation where my Lord Jesus is appointed the anti graft czar and he has no disciples in office? These officers must be retained for their memory of the operations of the office,"" Mutula added.

There have been accusations that some of the clergy, who control massive sums of cash, have purchased personal vehicles using church resources. Sources within the church identified bishops in Nyanza, Western and Rift Valley alleged to have made such purchases in the last one year. One source told the Star: most of the dioceses do not comply with the ACK constitution, government legislation and income tax requirements, adding that there is need to probe and ensure that all bishops pay taxes because they earn salaries and responsibility allowances. According to ACK documents seen by the Star, a newly elected bishop earns a basic salary of SH51,980, house allowance of Sh25,900, responsibility allowance Sh17,000 and Sh7,000 hospital plus an annual leave allowance of Sh30,000, all totalling Sh1,282,560 annually. A vicar general and provost earn Sh612,000 while archdeacons are paid Sh341,000 with rural deans making Sh267,000 and priests Sh218,000 annually. Deacons take home a paltry Sh143,000. The ACK which also runs guest houses, hospitals besides community services is thought to have a Sh2.5 billion budget annually. ""Each of the 46 dioceses runs a budget of between Sh60 million and Sh75 million each financial year that is under the control of bishops, who do not employ qualified accountants to keep their books of accounts,"" said a source. A priest who was arbitrarily dismissed said: ""It is devastating that we serve without due appointment letters and our terms and conditions of service are not spelt out accordingly as should be. It will surprise many that even heads of the departments are never paid their due allowances and imagine more than 300 priests who have retired have no pension while those in service do not get their actual salaries..they are suffering."" The workers have called for openness, transparency and accountability in management of financial affairs in the church, new human resource and administrative structures alongside stipulated appointment contracts for lay staff."444,The Star,6/1/2012,Anti-Corruption Commission Faults Bank Over Sh60 Million Ministry Cash,,KENYA (94%),,Newspaper,Jillo Kadida,ENGLISH,,15-Jun-12,"NAIROBI, KENYA (57%)",356 words,CORRUPTION (91%); ETHICS (90%); BANKING & FINANCE (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); LETTERS OF CREDIT (78%); LITIGATION (76%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (71%) Kenya; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Banking and Insurance,"The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has faulted a bank for seeking an order for the release of Sh60 million belonging to medical services ministry to pay for goods yet to be delivered. The money in question is held at Co-operative Bank of Kenya and is frozen for six months following of a court order. The order was issued by Justice Hatari Waweru after the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission said it has evidence showing the money was transferred into collateral accounts under suspect circumstances. The bank wants the order lifted saying it is detrimental and exposes it to legal suits. The bank in its suit papers denies holding a sum of Sh60 million on behalf of the ministry, saying the account has Sh19 million. And the money in question, the bank says, is collateral security in respect of letters of credit issued by the bank on the request of the ministry in favour of Total Hospital Solutions Ltd and Northwest Medical Ltd. The ministry is said to have ordered for goods from the two companies. According to the commission one of the private companies namely Total Hospital Solutions Limited is to supply, deliver, install, test and commission cold room machines at Tigoni district hospital mortuary and this has not happened. The second company was to supply washing machine at Wajir district hospital and spinal injury hospital in Nairobi. However this has not been supplied. The commission says that the two companies also do not operate from corner house address they gave as their office address. It also noted that the procurement irregularities revealed so far are sufficient cause to continue holding the funds in the account so as to safeguard public interest. The commission has said it has been established that the money is meant for payment of goods and services but there is no evidence to support the claim. The EACC alleges that the money lies in the accounts and even bank staff are not sure how to deal with it as there is no instruction given in relation to it. And as a result, it said, there is need to preserve the money as the commission investigates the transfer. The case will be heard on June 19."445,The Star,6/1/2012,"So, Who Are Real Beneficiaries of Corruption in the Mara?

The article was in response to a blog post by British billionaire Sir Richard Branson in which he had announced his investment in a new camp, Mahali Mzuri, in a conservancy near the Mara National Reserve. The writers ridiculed Sir Richard and also questioned the motives of the former chairman of the Tourism Federation, Jake Grieves-Cook, for his role in Sir Richard's investment in the camp, accusing him of being a neo-colonialist and taking advantage of the Masaai community. Grieves-Cook had invited Sir Richard to invest in the land along the route of the great migration in order to secure a safe and extended passage for the wildlife, which he claims has been threatened by locals grazing animals in that area. The investment has also ensured employment for the local people. Sir Richard's direct investment is in contrast to the illegal land grabbing going on inside the Mara by the Maasai elite. The conservancies, which Branson and Grieves-Cook are involved in, are leased directly from the land owners who are paid monthly rents. The land is located adjacent to the park and not inside the Maasai Mara National Reserve. Tourism activity in conservancies is regulated; visitor numbers are limited by having a maximum of one camp per 700 acres and 12 tents to any camp. Tourist companies running these camps must pay the rent for 700 acres for every tent. Richard Branson will therefore have to pay rent for 8,400 acres for 12 tents. This is in contrast to the fees paid by camps and lodges located inside the Mara Reserve. Direct investments have benefited the community. Branson, for instance, has funded the building of a school at Sekenani. Porini is another camp that has been supporting a school at Oloibormurt near Ol Kinyei Conservancy. The camp contributes $10 for every tourist to a trust that is providing water projects for communities, among other community development initiatives. Contrast this with the investment of a former elected leader of Narok County Council, who has also been an appointee of other statutory bodies; he allocated himself a 10 km stretch along a river inside the park, for which he drafted a 33-year lease with the council. He paid Sh60,000 for the lease and within the last three years has earned more than Sh51 million as brokerage fee since he could not afford to invest in property on the land himself. Over the same period, the county council of Narok has only earned a total of Sh13m from this asset. If the deal had been a direct agreement between the council and an investor, the Sh51 million could have been spent on development of the roads in the Mara. In this case, however, the broker will continue to earn an average of Sh20 million a year for the next 26 years, with little benefit to the people of Narok County. So who is really exploiting the Maasai? Most residents of Narok are rightly concerned about the controversial contract between Equity Bank and Narok County Council. However the dubious deals between the Maasai elite and the council should get as much attention. The outright exploitation of the community's assets by land-grabbing former Narok County Council officials is an injustice that cannot be ignored. The writers of the aforementioned article seem to have been more interested in grandstanding; taking on a billionaire was obviously more thrilling than addressing the real issues that affect the Maasai. Grieves-Cook's record in conservation work speaks for itself and it is unfortunate that he has been labelled as an agent for neo-colonialism without due regard for his service to the tourism industry. No one can argue with the fact that the Maasai people have been exploited historically, but it is disingenuous for the writers to refer to a treaty signed at the beginning of the 20th century as the only evidence of the suffering of the Maasai people. Since independence, successive governments have continued to expropriate Maasai land. It seems, however, that it is politically and historically convenient to focus only on the past while ignoring present injustices. The article claims that there is no need for extra land to be protected for wildlife on the migration path as there is already land set aside for this purpose. However, wildlife is not confined to this area and often 'spills over'; it is common practice for private landowners to enter into agreement with investors or conservation groups for them to allow the passage of wildlife on their land. There is, therefore, nothing strange about the concept behind the Mahali Mzuri camp. If the community is happy to open their lands for wildlife then that should be respected as a community decision and not exploitation. The Maasai understand that the Mara is an important resource for the county. They have lived with the animals for years and they will support any initiative that protects the ecosystem. Moreover, despite the common human-wildlife conflict the Maasai have always shown incredible restraint even when the Kenya Wildlife Service has been slow to deal with wayward animals. In fact, there is no greater expression of how much the Maasai value the Mara than their vociferous protest of the council's neglect of the deplorable Lemek road, which is undermining business in the town. They also know that the lack of garbage collection services and poor drainage in Narok town can be fixed by the council's prudent use of park fees collected from the Mara. The people of Narok can also see through the hypocrisy of those who choose to talk about non-existent exploitation while ignoring their real concerns."446,The Star,7/7/2012,The Great Transition - Corruption and Ngoroko Season [opinion],,KENYA (92%),,Newspaper,John Githongo,ENGLISH,,9-Jul-12,,1813 words,HELICOPTERS (90%); CONSPIRACY (90%); ASSASSINATION (90%); POLITICS (89%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (89%); CORRUPTION (88%); INVESTIGATIONS (86%); EMERGENCY VEHICLES (78%); AIRCRAFT ACCIDENTS (78%); AIRCRAFT PILOTS (78%); CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES CRIME (77%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (77%); WOUNDS & INJURIES (76%); LABOR DEPARTMENTS (73%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (71%); DRUG TRAFFICKING (64%); ILLEGAL DRUGS (64%) Kenya; Corruption,"On June 20, a helicopter carrying the minister for Internal Security Prof George Saitoti and his assistant minister Orwa Ojode crashed in Ngong killing both ministers, their aides and police chopper crew. The Kibaki tenure has been a particularly tragic one when one counts the number of senior officials and politicians who have died around the Head of State. This time things are different, however, and point to a mood that will set the tone for the intense political period we are about to enter. On January 24, 2003, a plane full of government officials and their supporters crashed in Busia. Three died - including the pilot, one other crew member and the Minister for Labour, Ahmed Khalif. Eleven were injured including Dr Wanjiru Kihoro, the wife of seasoned politician and democracy activist Wanyiri Kihoro. Dr Wanjiru Kihoro passed away after almost four years in a coma in 2006. Back then, no conspiracy theories or rumours of assassination gained any traction. The helicopter crash last month was different. Almost immediately, foul play was suspected. On Twitter, Facebook and by SMS, countless theories were advanced, with most insinuating that someone may have killed the ministers. To start with, fingers were quietly pointed at top officials in the regime. Then a conspiracy theory in part born out of one of the saddest and damaging legacies of the Kibaki era - a dramatic laissez-faire criminalisation of our politics and society despite undeniable economic achievements - began to gain traction. All this while proper investigations were just kicking off. This theory held that the ministers had been assassinated by elements of the regime involved in the illicit drug trade. For me, what was important was that Kenyans were willing to believe this: that at the top of our government are politicians so deeply embroiled in the drug business which is transforming our politics starting at the Coast, that they had no qualms about killing the minister of Internal Security and his deputy. The conspiracy theory gained momentum when Members of Parliament alleged the same on the floor of the house. Perceptions were, in my opinion, irrevocably worsened when the family of Prof Saitoti reportedly hired their own investigators to look into the crash, alleging a cover-up by officers of the very government that the minister and his deputy had led. This demonstrated a total lack of faith and confidence in the investigation process initiated by the very regime Prof Saitoti had served so close to the very top. It should trouble us that so many of us are willing to believe that elements within our own government are willing to kill their colleagues in this way at this time. Indeed, one young but hardened cynic observed to me, ""If the Government spokesman, Alfred Mutua, had immediately come out to deny the rumours in anyway, that would have been confirmation that there was some truth in them."" This extreme low trust environment has implications. It most certainly complicates life for the IEBC which now cannot afford to put a foot wrong; even genuine mistakes are likely to be read with a political lens in a highly ethnically polarised environment. Kenya is about to hold the world's most expensive election at $20 (Sh1,680) per vote if, say, we had 10 million voters. Politicians are also due to spend a totally unprecedented amounts of money. A Nairobi-based think tank, the Coalition for Accountable Political Financing, recently estimated that that the top presidential candidates will spend between US$100 million (Sh8.4bn) and US$150 million (Sh12.6bn) each. The presidential campaigns alone could cost US$500 million (Sh42bn). These figures are Nigeriaesque and Nigeria has oil money to spend and misspend on these things. So where will the money come from? While serious fortunes exist among members of the elite, accumulated largely via graft and the abuse of public office over the last 49 years, it is also becoming clear that there is a considerable amount of money sloshing about this economy from more opaque sources. There is a consistency to reports of mainly Coastal-based drug barons and up-country money launderers injecting huge sums into the campaign kitties of some leading contenders. Traditionally, the period after the reading of the last budget before an election is the start of shakedown season. Aspirants start by hitting up members of the private sector, then investors who are still in a fragile contractual condition, before moving on to squeeze as much out of the public purse as possible via kickbacks, skimming off procurement contracts and the like. The unenthusiastic can find themselves 'encouraged' by visits from the taxman or even police. Businessmen dish out the cash to all sides to hedge their bets. It is thus that giant public works projects seemingly hurriedly cooked up in the year prior to polls have a habit of becoming white elephants whose utility declines once they have finished serving as vehicles to mobilise election finances. In my opinion, however, these tried and tested tactics simply don't begin to explain the kind of resources already being splashed about by some of the leading contenders. In the 1980s, before full liberalisation of the economy, the capture of regulatory agencies was enough to mobilise resources for political activity. After the reintroduction of political pluralism, specifically designed scams to extract resources from the Consolidated Fund kicked in. Goldenberg cost us roughly 10 percent of GDP. At the same time with liberalisation graft moved from the weakened regulatory agencies to revenue collection bodies; it moved, in a sense, from the capital to the Coast. Giant sugar and maize importation scams for example were all the rage from the mid-1990s and to an extent to this day as well. Throughout the 1990s, land allocations by the head of state, especially in urban areas, also became a strong feature of corruption by public officials facing elections. By 2003, internal and external pressure increased media scrutiny and political fragmentation among the elite had forced large scale graft to retreat into 'national security'. The looting of police and other agencies in the sector turned national security into the last refuge of the corrupt. It partly explains why so many of our police helicopters are unserviceable or fall from the sky. From around 2005, however, it also became clear that drugs and money laundering had become important sources of political resources. It would also seem that a chunk of the resources fiddled from the oil revenues of the South Sudan government found their way to Kenya much in the same way as some of the ransoms associated with piracy. Remember, Nairobi, for now, remains the commercial capital of Somalia. While an open-door policy with regard to drug money and the involvement of top officials (and their wives and other relatives) in part explains where the flood of cash for siasa is coming from, elite political fragmentation has increased the currency of intimidation and assassination as tools of political management. Assassination has always been a feature of Kenyan politics. Shoot-to-kill policies with regard to the so-called Mungiki menace started in earnest around 2007. A culture of extrajudicial killings was normalised. Though in truth a similar condition had held sway in much of Northern Kenya for decades. Anyway, the new situation was most dramatically exemplified by the murder in broad daylight of Oscar Kamau King'ara and John Paul Oulu in March 2009. There in particular seems to be a systematic pattern of these killings that went into high gear once it became clear that the ICC process the elite had thought would take decades would move did so more quickly than they had anticipated. Since the ICC named its key suspects in December 2010 we have witnessed an intensification of these trends. A number of witnesses and potential witnesses for the ICC have been assassinated or simply disappeared without a trace since. Then earlier this year the body of the Mombasa-based Samir Khan - previously arrested as a terror suspect together with Mohammed Kassim - was found in the middle of Tsavo National Park. In May, it was reported in the media that the President and the head of the National Security Intelligence Service had met to discuss the risk of chaos before and after the elections. What was curious about this was that it was not reported in the media at all! Presumably the NSIS boss briefs the President regularly about the 'risk of chaos' without there being the need to tell the world that this is happening. Similarly, the media has carried regular reports about Mungiki 'regrouping' and 'reorganising' in a manner so consistent that it has led some to question whether Kenyans are being prepared for a crackdown of some sort. Maina Njenga, former head of Mungiki, has since late last year - uncharacteristically for someone who has been through his share of scraps with individuals and institutions that want him dead - publicly raised the alarm that his life is in danger, even reporting the matter to the police. Njenga joins the growing number of those who have gone to the police to report receiving death threats, including a government minister and several politicians. This has been accompanied by consistent rumours of a list of ""meigwa (Gikuyu for thorns) that need to be removed""; on it are the names of top state officials with reformist credentials, politicians and civil society activists. Add to this a most bizarre and brazen open threat meted out directly against an editor at The Star among other incidents and one may be left wondering whether all these events are a throwback to the period just before President Kenyatta died when a 'Ngoroko' plot to assassinate leaders to manage the transition was exposed. One cannot tell for sure except that anti-reformist elements would seem to have retreated into a dark space in this period in the run-up to the next elections. It reminds us that the explosion of violence in 2008 was an aberration that the elite lost control over. It was this loss of control that led to the bizarre situation where presidential candidates today also face trials for crimes against humanity at the ICC. Throughout the 1990s, election-related violence was state directed, or directed by elements of the state. We are back in that space today. A bungling transition seems to be guaranteed by the absence of any form of central management of this critical process. Add to this a host of internal contradictions amplified by the on-going constitutional reform process, the ICC, al Shabaab, the inexorable rise and apparent consolidation of power by drug dealers and money launderers at the heart of the elite and intimidation and assassination have gained a new and potentially destabilising currency."447,The Star,7/11/2012,Kenya Will Still Pip UK in Corruption [opinion],,"UNITED KINGDOM (95%); KENYA (94%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (92%); UNITED STATES (79%); EUROPE (79%); AFRICA (77%)",,Newspaper,Pheroze Nowrojee,ENGLISH,,12-Jul-12,,754 words,CORRUPTION (92%); FINES & PENALTIES (91%); PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MFG (90%); PHARMACEUTICALS INDUSTRY (90%); BRIBERY (90%); DEVELOPMENT BANKS (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (77%); EXECUTIVES (77%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (77%); TEXTBOOKS (76%); RULE OF LAW (76%); GUILTY PLEAS (72%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (56%); INTERBANK LENDING (55%); INTEREST RATES (55%); ECONOMIC NEWS (55%) Kenya; Corruption; Europe and Africa,"On a day last week, the same issue of a newspaper reported 1. Britain's Barclays Bank had been fined half a billion dollars due to corrupt practices and its CEO and the chairman had resigned; 2. GlaxoSmithKline, the British medicines maker had pleaded guilty to healthcare fraud and been fined $3 billion; and 3. Oxford University Press had bribed government officials in Kenya and Tanzania and been fined half a billion dollars too by the World Bank. Barclays had been rigging the inter-bank interest rate. GlaxoSmithKline had been violating laws involving medicines taken by millions of sick persons, had been promoting their medicines for unapproved purposes and had failed to report safety problems. They were also overcharging the US Government and paying kickbacks to doctors. Oxford University Press had been making improper payments to Government officials on contracts to supply text books. (The Standard, 4 July 2012). These are terrible developments. If this goes on any more, Britain will overtake Kenya in global corruption, and Kenya will lose its pre-eminent place there. It was not easy achieving our high standing. It took decades of venal leaders, bent accounting officers and dedicated greedy families. Now it seems as if all their hard work will go to naught. In this Olympic year Britain may well move to the top of Transparency International's Corruption Index. We should however not lose heart. We have many practiced advantages: 1. Our fines are non-existent. 2. We accuse persons of corruption, we never convict them. This gives us a real edge. 3. We accept all denials and legal objections, reflecting our unswerving commitment to the Rule of Law. 4. Great Britain has reached only three scandals a day. On any given day we in Kenya can muster at least ten. 5. We play from a position of real strength. We draw upon a pool of 42 Cabinet Ministers, 50 Permanent Secretaries and 210 elected MPs. We have as many extras waiting on the bench as substitutes - all our aspiring candidates. Then if Britain moves any stronger in the field, we are able to fall back on 210 CDFs, numerous tenders and single-sourced procurement. We have depth. We should not let this make us complacent, nor to overlook the strengths of our competitors. Losing its former monopolies and captive markets to competition, CorruptionGB has become an aggressive player, hungry for that Transparency International top spot. Its culprits are better at showing remorse. Barclays said they wished it had never happened. Now none of our suspects ever says that. Ours wish it would keep happening. Barclays' Chairman declared, ""The buck stops with me."" Our Chairmen always pass that buck. Glaxo expressed regret - after seven years of breaking the law. They said, Glaxo ""has learned from the mistakes that were made."" This is really admirable. They are making corruption a corporate educational process. Our own perpetrators learn nothing from being caught, and thus have not yet applied to be appointed adjunct professors at our business schools. Are these large fines deterrents to all this corruption? The researched answer is No. Social science research has long ago established that increased punishments are not a deterrent to crime or corruption. It found that the true deterrence is increasing the likelihood of being found out: the greater the likelihood of being caught, the greater the deterrence. This is reflected in the thinking of these very smart CEOs. Well aware of the wrongdoing, they continue it as long as they can get away with it. Their 'remorse' further demonstrates this. Barclays' CEO resigned not because the bank broke the law or made criminal profits, but, by his own statement, because, ""The external pressure placed on Barclays has reached a level that risks damaging the franchise - I cannot let that happen."" (Ibid) But he could let the criminal activity happen. The conditions imposed on Glaxo in addition to the fines are more to the point. Glaxo will be ""monitored by the government for five years to ensure the company complies with marketing and other rules."" (Ibid) We in Kenya have moved from no regulation to regulation, but there is little monitoring or sanctions. Last year, the Central Bank of Kenya stated publicly that five banks had been manipulating the shilling-dollar rate for their own profit. But he declined to name them. No prosecution or public punishment ever followed. No preventive monitoring was imposed. As long as our regulators are also in our pool of players we will remain the tops."448,The Star,7/11/2012,PLO Slams Corruption Challenge in Africa,,"AFRICA (97%); KENYA (93%); RWANDA (79%); BURUNDI (79%); UGANDA (79%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (79%); SUDAN (78%) Africa",,Newspaper,Elizabeth Were,ENGLISH,,12-Jul-12,"NAIROBI, KENYA (58%)",255 words,CORRUPTION (95%); MALARIA (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (78%); RELIGION (70%); CLERGY & RELIGIOUS (51%) Kenya; Corruption,"FORMER director of the defunct Kenya Anti Corruption Commission Patrick Lumumba has said corruption is a major challenge affecting African countries.

According to sources, Safran Morpho has been picked to supply the biometric voter registration kits for the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. This is after the Canadian company, Code Inc., was left out because it could not manufacture the kits in time for the exercise. Safran Morpho, previously Sagem S. A. is understood to have already ordered up to 15,000 parts of the BVR kits from Dell, an American multinational computer technology corporation. The company was among the bidders for the IEBC tender that was cancelled. It however did not make it to the shortlist that included 4G of India, Symphony of Kenya, Face Technologies of South Africa and Ontrack Innovations of Israel. It was represented in the IEBC tender opening by a B. Ravier, Francis Cito and Jacob Chuwa. All the three did not respond to our queries yesterday. The French company had also not responded to our e-mail questions sent to its headquarters in Paris, France by the time of going to press. The company had participated in the Sh8 billion third generation National Identity Cards tender that was nullified by the Public Procurement Review Administrative Board after the Ministry of Immigration forged minutes. The government of Canada is procuring the BVR kits for IEBC in what is termed as ""a government to government deal"" with Nairobi in which the former is giving Kenya a Sh4.6 billion loan. The Kenya government offered to assist IEBC procure the kits after the original tender was cancelled. IEBC chairman Ahmed Issack Hassan told two parliamentary committees that the tender was cancelled because the first two shortlisted firms, 4G and Symphony did not meet the integrity test while the other two, Facetech and Ontrac had quoted above budget. Safran Morpho, then trading as Sagem S. A, was caught in a web of corruption in Abuja, over which the Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo sacked some ministers for taking bribes."453,The Star,9/11/2012,Public Officers Jailed for Corruption,,KENYA (94%),,Newspaper,Sam Kiplagat,ENGLISH,,12-Sep-12,"NAIROBI, KENYA (92%)",432 words,JAIL SENTENCING (91%); CORRUPTION (91%); CULTURE DEPARTMENTS (90%); FINES & PENALTIES (90%); SENTENCING (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); VERDICTS (90%); CONSPIRACY (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (90%); GOVERNMENT TOURIST OFFICES (89%); CONVENTION & VISITORS BUREAUS (89%); TOURISM DEVELOPMENT (89%); HOTELS & MOTELS (78%); LITIGATION (77%); APPOINTMENTS (77%); TOURISM (77%); CAPITAL PUNISHMENT (76%); WILDLIFE (76%); LAWYERS (74%); RESORTS (72%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (71%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (71%); TRAVELER SAFETY & SECURITY (71%); TOUR OPERATORS (71%); TALKS & MEETINGS (69%) Kenya; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Governance; Travel and Tourism,"A trip to the Maasai Mara for all Permanent Secretaries four years ago led to the jailing yesterday of a former PS and two associates. The three were found guilty of a total of eleven counts of fraud and abuse of office. In a chilling message to other corrupt public officers, a Nairobi court sentenced former Tourism and Wildlife PS Rebecca Nabutola to four years in jail without an option of a fine. The court further fined Nabutola Sh2 million after she was found guilty of abuse of office and conspiracy to defraud the ministry. If Nabutola fails to pay the fine, senior principal magistrate Lucy Nyambura said she will serve a further three years in jail. The court sentenced former Kenya Tourist Board managing director Dr Achieng Ong'ong'a to three years in jail plus a fine of Sh1.5 million. Ong'ong'a will serve a further three years if he fails to pay the fine. An alleged accomplice and former KTB board member Duncan Kuguru was sentenced to seven years and a fine of Sh17.85 million as per the Anti Corruption and Economic Crimes Act. If he defaults, the businessman will pay an additional Sh1.5 million or serve another two years in jail. The court found that they conspired to defraud the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife of Sh8.9 million between June and December 2007. During the trip in October 2008, the PSs visited various hotels and resorts in the game reserve, went game viewing and held meetings with stakeholders in tourism, security personnel and local authorities. Nabutola denied allegations that she authorized payments to a tour operator for services not rendered but the court wondered why she never questioned the payment as the accounting officer in the Ministry of Tourism. ""The procedure for payment was followed to the best of my knowledge... no questions were brought to my attention at any stage and I wasn't informed of any anomaly,"" Nabutola had defended herself. The former PS was accused of abuse of office by appointing Kuguru's firm Maniago Safaris to co-ordinate transport to the game reserve and instructing the Catering and Tourism Development Levy Trustees to foot the bill. The court was told that an audit report at KTB for 2007/08 revealed suspect funds were released to Kuguru purportedly to organise the trip. According to the prosecution, Nabutola authored the idea, Achieng sanctioned it and the businessman was paid Sh8.925 million for the trip. The three were escorted to the basement cells in the court yesterday to begin their sentences even as their lawyers made frantic efforts to file a stay of execution pending appeal against their sentences."454,The Star,9/12/2012,"Film Commission Denies Allegations of Corruption, Tribalism",,KENYA (94%); FRANCE (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); AFRICA (79%),,Newspaper,Francis Mureithi,ENGLISH,"CALIFORNIA, USA (79%)",13-Sep-12,,469 words,"CORRUPTION (93%); CULTURE DEPARTMENTS (90%); ENTERTAINMENT & ARTS (90%); MOVIE INDUSTRY (90%); FILM (90%); VISUAL ARTISTS (90%); MOVIE & VIDEO PRODUCTION (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); EXECUTIVES (89%); INTERNATIONAL TOURISM (89%); ENERGY & UTILITY LAW (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (74%); BUDGETS (74%); FESTIVALS (73%); ARTS FESTIVALS & EXHIBITIONS (73%); LOBBYING (73%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (72%); PRIME MINISTERS (66%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (66%) Kenya; Corruption; Arts, Culture and Entertainment","The CEO of The Kenya Film Commission Peter Mutie yesterday denied that the commission was riddled with corruption, nepotism and tribalism. While appearing before the Energy, Information and Communication Committee which is chaired by James Rege (Karachuonyo), Mutie denied claims by a section of film-makers that he was engaging in extravagant foreign trips that have not been beneficial to the industry. He said he has made seven trips in the last two years which he described as ""a joke"" compared to trips being made by other African countries such as South Africa to promote their film industries globally. Mutie refuted allegations that the Kalasha Awards were riddled with corruption and misuse of public funds. ""KFC is not corrupt. We do not inflate our budget. Like Kalasha Awards, it is a process not an event and its culmination is during the gala dinner,"" said Mutie. He was accompanied by Minister for Information and Communications Samuel Poghiso, PS Dr Bitange Ndemo and KFC board members. The minister and the PS however did not give their official response on the matter as they are scheduled to have a separate session with the committee. A lobby group, led by filmmaker Roy Ogolla, wrote to Parliament complaining that KFC was riddled with corruption, tribalism, nepotism and a host of vices in the industry. The filmmaker also wrote to the Prime Minister, the Information ministry PS and to the Public Service Commission, calling for a thorough investigation of the commission. They complained that Sh20 million has been spent by the CEO in the last two years for foreign trips. The group cited the recent trips to Cannes Film Festival in France by the CEO and two other officials of the commission claiming they drew per diem of Sh465,000 each for a 14-day stay, way beyond the stipulated 10 per cent of an individual's salary. The group further claimed that at last year's Association of Film Commissioners International event at Santa Monica, California USA, KFC requested separate funds for a booth and a stand yet they are one and the same. While defending the commission, the CEO termed the Sh20 million as an exaggeration. He was however unable to justify various vouchers he had signed during the same period and pleaded for more time from the committee. Committee member Emilio Kathuri (Manyatta) demanded to know why the CEO was not accompanied by the commission's finance director. He dismissed an explanation by the CEO that the director was in Mombasa for official duty. ""We expect him to be with you here, or could this be a deliberate move to get us derailed. Soon or later, Parliament will get dissolved and the CEO will get off the hook,"" said Kathuri. Aden Duale (Dujis) said the CEO should be prepared to explain to the committee all the vouchers he had signed and justify the expenditures."455,The Star,9/28/2012,New Anti Corruption Chair to Be Nominated,,KENYA (94%); AFRICA (55%),,Newspaper,Ramadhan Rajab,ENGLISH,,29-Sep-12,"NAIROBI, KENYA (87%)",337 words,APPOINTMENTS (92%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (92%); CORRUPTION (91%); ETHICS (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); PRIME MINISTERS (90%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (90%); APPROVALS (78%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (74%); INJUNCTIONS (65%); HUMAN RIGHTS (51%) Kenya; Governance; Legal and Judicial Affairs; International Organizations and Africa,"Attorney General has said a new Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission chair may be appointed in two weeks.

The process of hiring commissioners and chair of EACC has faced many hurdles. The EACC was established after the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission was disbanded last year. In May this year a group of MPs opposed the nominations of the Matemu, Onsongo and Keino. The MPs questioned Matemu's character and said Onsongo and Keino lack passion to fight graft. They were however defeated in their bid to block the three from appointment. After parliaments approved the three, a human rights activists moved to a Nakuru court and obtained a temporary order blocking Matemu from taking office saying his appointment was unconstitutional. Justice Anyara Emukule further referred the case to the Chief Justice Willy Mutunga who set up a three-judge bench in Nairobi to hear the suitability of Matemo. Matemu's appointment was later challenged in a Nakuru court where, on May 16, Justice Anyara Emukule issued temporary injunction and referred the case to Chief Justice Willy Mutunga to set up a three-judge bench in Nairobi. Last week the three-judge bench of Justices Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, and Mumbi annulled Matemu's appointment citing that the Executive and MPs had failed to interrogate his integrity and competence for the position.

High Court judge David Majanja said he is satisfied the three are proper parties in the matter. While EACC and Inuka Kenya were joined as interested parties, Katiba Institute, represented by Yash Pal Ghai, was allowed to be a friend of the court in the case.

Justice Majanja directed the AG and the interested parties to respond to the suit within 21 days.The parties were also told to exchange written submissions. CIC says the Act, which was passed by Parliament recently, does not meet the constitutional threshold and has been severely watered down. Through lawyer Njoroge Regeru, CIC says Parliament failed to enact the legislation within the deadline set out in the fifth schedule. The Leadership and Integrity Act was enacted to operatinalise Chapter six of the Constitution.

Or you could look at it as the latest episode of a long-running, bit cheap, but still chuckle-worthy soap. And there was a tiny bit of excitement in this saga recently: Ireland found that EUR4m given to Uganda by the Irish government for development in Uganda's north had gone missing. Those were funds channeled through the prime minister's office. When Ireland began looking for its cash, it turned out that an even larger sum for northern Uganda, EUR12 not just from Ireland, but also Norway, Sweden and Denmark, had been misappropriated. The Irish were displeased, but the Ugandan PM was casual - this is clearly a man with a hands-off approach to running his office that rivals that of a neighbouring president. He said this to Irish RTE One: 'I didn't even know. No money was ever paid to me and I never handled money. As Prime Minister I never handle money of Government. Never.' I suspect raising the concept of political responsibility with this gentleman might be a waste of time, so don't. Intriguingly, RTE also wrote 'Local media say the officials perpetrated the fraud from the basement of the office building in which Mr Mbabazi is based.' But maybe Mr Mbabazi was a little too casual. Losing a couple of million euros is not ideal, especially when it was play money for friends and family, but also not the end of the world. The smaller countries like Ireland and Denmark were always more ready to withhold aid (even if only temporarily) than the biggies. Whatevs. But this time, even the biggies were reacting. Last week, the UK announced that it would suspend all direct aid to the Ugandan government. According to the Guardian, total direct financial aid for the current fiscal year was GBP26.9m, of which the remaining GBP11.1m have been frozen for now. Oops. Better find a few minutes to contain this. The Guardian reported on 20 November 2012: 'In a meeting with the EU, US, China, Japan, the World Bank and the IMF on Monday, the Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, acknowledged the ""rampant corruption in the country"" and vowed to clean up the civil service.' I suspect Mr Museveni just pulled out the standard manual on 'Responses to Donors Complaining About Corruption' and scanned through the options in his multiple-choice menu (more than one selection allowed: Deny everything; complain about interference in sovereignty, optional: accuse of neo-colonianism, Mugabe variant: accuse of gay gangsterims; emphasise theft of public resources is naturally utterly inacceptable; promise rigorous follow up; claim that UG can do very well thankyouverymuchwithchips without aid, optional: threaten look-East policy; recent addition: threaten withdrawal from Somalia). Faced with clearly strengthened donor willingness to cut not just symbolic amounts of aid, he must have decided to edit the selected response slightly to include the 'rampant' bit and generally seem a bit more conciliatory. Plus add the usual routine of a few court cases against officials of the Office of the Prime Minister. Pole sana for the people who got dragged to court, but they will be reasonably sure that their cases will go nowhere. Also, how tedious that this oil money takes so long to materialise. This has always worked quite well because, of course, donors also have something to lose: if they cut aid in response to corruption allegations, this means that they need to reduce their portfolio in the recipient country. Aid is their business, and no aid means no jobs. Plus outrage at the UG government has to be tempered for PR purposes: surely large-scale corruption doesn't come out of nowhere - anyone with even the most rudimentary Google skills can easily pull up a portfolio of Uganda's Great Hall of Corruption Fame. So why keep giving money to a government that is clearly corrupt? The World Bank - an organisation that has VIP tickets in access to Uganda's fiscal and other data - is reportedly also assessing its engagement with Uganda and came to the following cutting-edge conclusion: 'The recent allegations indicate that the overall fiduciary environment in Uganda needs to be strengthened to ensure better management of public resources.' No kidding, Captain Obvious! Uganda receives on average USD350m to USD400m a year from the World Bank, and of that, USD100m is not tied to any projects, but is direct budget support. I'm curious to see how this will play out. By which I mean: how long will it take everyone to go through the usual motions and reinstate funding. For one, Uganda is still an important player in Somalia where few other countries were ready to send troops. And the situation in eastern DRC might also require some consideration. Plus, all those aid agency folks want to get on with their business. Here's a hint: According to Uganda's Independent, the US ambassador to Uganda said: 'The U.S has decided to continue giving aid to Uganda despite the ongoing numerous investigations into the misuse of foreign aid.'"463,The Star,11/27/2012,Interviews for Anti Corruption Commission CEO,,KENYA (59%),,Newspaper,Maureen Waruinge,ENGLISH,,27-Nov-12,,34 words,CORRUPTION (90%); EMPLOYMENT SEARCH (89%); ETHICS (88%) Kenya; Corruption; Labour; Governance,  Interviews for the head of the ethics and anti corruption commission will be conducted next week.

The report has also stated that modern job creation in the country is still low in comparison to the large number of job seekers. While each year 800,000 people reach the working age, there are only 50,000 jobs available which leads to high competition. The high competition is the contributor to nepotism, tribalism, bribery, and sexual harassment in the job market according to the report. To create more good jobs Kenya needs to boost the skills of its workforce, the report recommends. The report has noted that more modern jobs have been created and there is less reliance on subsistence farming. It give the example of less than half of Kenya's total population being engaged in subsistence farming as opposed to two out of three people 20 years ago.

The survey recommends that Kenya should increase its manufacturing capacity and help the high number of people leaving family farming activities to create agricultural processing for export, in order to increase employment opportunities."467,The Star,12/11/2012,Fighting Corruption the Singapore Way [opinion],,SINGAPORE (97%); ASIA (79%); KENYA (79%); AFRICA (79%),,Newspaper,Hukka Warrio,ENGLISH,,12-Dec-12,,875 words,"CORRUPTION (94%); BRIBERY (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (89%); BEST PRACTICES (89%); EVIDENCE (88%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); IMMIGRATION (78%); CIVIL SERVICES (77%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (77%); PRIME MINISTERS (77%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (77%); WITNESSES (75%); ARREST WARRANTS (75%); ARRESTS (75%); EXCISE & CUSTOMS (75%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (75%); FINES & PENALTIES (70%); BANKING & FINANCE (69%); EMPLOYMENT SEARCH (68%); CRIMINAL FINES (67%); CARTELS (56%); LICENSES & PERMITS (50%) Kenya; Corruption; Asia, Australia, and Africa","The UN International Anti-Corruption day is commemorated worldwide on December 9. What better time to mull over international best practices against graft? In this article, I shall highlight Singapore's experience of 'keeping the government clean,' as narrated by Lee Kuan Yew, Prime Minister of Singapore, 1959-1990, in his famous book, From Third World to First. At independence from Britain in 1965, the government in Singapore was held hostage by corrupt officials: the police formed cartels to collect monthly baksheesh from transport companies and failure to pay would invite an arrest warrant on trumped up charges; one had to pay a bribe to be admitted into hospital even after a road accident; customs and immigration officials were on the take; procurement officers provided information on tender bids for a fee; even garbage collectors would not do their job without being paid a bribe! The first independence government under Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew came to power with 'a deep sense of mission to establish a clean government.' All Ministers except one, were university graduates. They were professionals who came into politics to serve, not to seek employment or to enrich themselves. Ministers commanded the respect of the people and of public servants. They exuded confidence and a sense of purpose. Lee's Party moved quickly to put regulatory oversight and statutory instruments in place to prevent, detect, deter and stop corruption in its tracks. An anti-graft body, The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) was formed under a director and given sweeping powers including power of arrest, investigations of bank accounts and bank books of suspects, their wives, husbands, children or agents. CPIB officers had full government support to deal with all transgressors without exception. They carried out thorough investigations and worked hand-in-hand with the courts which in turn enforced the law without fear or favour. Petty corruption was dealt with by among other measures, simplifying procedures, taking away discretionary powers and abolishing certain permits and licenses. So much for the small fish! For the big fish, more serious action was needed. Anti-graft laws were tightened to close loopholes to secure convictions. It became unnecessary to prove that the person who accepted a bribe was in a position to carry out the required favour. The Comptroller of Income Tax was obliged to give information on anyone investigated. Judges accepted the evidence of an accomplice. The courts took as corroborative evidence proof of the fact that the accused lived beyond his or her legitimate verifiable income, or had property that could not be explained by lawful, income. The CPIB director had the full power to investigate every person including high officials and ministers without fear of interference from any quarter. It was compulsory, by law, for witnesses summoned by the CPIB to present themselves in person to give information. In 1989, the maximum fine for corruption was increased from Singaporean dollars(S$)10,000 to S$100,000. Giving false information to the CPIB became an offence subject to imprisonment and a fine of up to S$10,000. The courts were empowered to confiscate benefits derived from corruption. The three decades from the 1960 saw at least three cabinet ministers, one in each decade, accused of impropriety, or behavior unbecoming. The first was Tan Kia Jan, Minister for National Development and later government representative on the board of Malaysian Airways. He was accused of taking bribe, of not discharging his duties beyond reproach, in the purchase of a Boeing aircraft by the airline. He was sacked and socially ostracized. Wee Toon Boon was Minister of State for the Environment in 1975 when he took a free trip to Indonesia for himself and his family members, paid for by a housing developer. He also accepted a bungalow from the developer. He was charged, convicted and sentenced to four years and six months in jail. He appealed. The conviction was upheld but the sentence was reduced by 18 months. The most memorable fall from grace and honour was perhaps that of Teh Chiang Wan, Minister for National Development in 1986. He admitted under cross-examination that he accepted two cash payments of S$400,000 each as bribe, 'in one case to allow a development company to retain parts of its land under compulsory acquisition by government and the second to assist a developer in purchasing state land for private development.' These payments were received in 1981 and 1982. When the evidence was out and he felt he had lost face, lost grace, lost honour and lost all, he did the unthinkable--he took his own life leaving a suicide note addressed to Prime Minister Lee. Prime Minister, I have been feeling very sad and depressed for the last two weeks. I feel responsible for the occurrence of this unfortunate incident and I feel I should take full responsibility. As an honourable oriental gentleman, I feel it is only right I should pay the highest penalty for my mistake. Yours faithfully, Teh Cheang Wan The Cheang Wan's widow and daughter left Singapore for exile and never returned. In the words of Lee Kuan Yew, 'they had lost too much face.' Amb. Dr Hukka Wario is a retired Civil Servant."468,The Star,12/15/2012,Anti Corruption Commission Warns Aspirants On Intergrity,,KENYA (93%),,Newspaper,Maureen Waruinge,ENGLISH,,17-Dec-12,,56 words,ETHICS (90%); ELECTIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (90%) Kenya; Governance; Company News,  Kenyans seeking political posts during the next general election are being reminded that they will be subjected to thorough vetting ahead of the next general election.

Chaacha Mwita, a former editor at Standard Group summed up Kibaki's tenure and his administration's efforts to combat corruption in his memoirs Citizen Power as thus: ""In my own lifetime, I have not witnessed a period in Kenya's history when grand high hopes fell to the ground and disintegrated into vapour with such dramatic intensity and irony as happened between 2002 and 2008."" Analysts said this was a failure by the Kibaki administration to respect institutions and less effort on national reconciliation. The President of the East African Law Society, Aggrey Mwamu, said the president's anti-corruption drive has totally failed, giving rise to so many mega scandals. And his 2,156-word Jamhuri Day speech never referred to his administration's fight against corruption, signaling the backburners where the vice finds itself today compared to his December 29, 2002 inaugural speech. The major corruption scandals that blotted the Kibaki's tenure was the Anglo Leasing-type projects in which the country lost more than Sh50 billion. Close allies of Kibaki including then Justice minister Kiraitu Murungi and his Treasury counterpart David Mwiraria who were implicated in the scandal were cleared under blurred circumstances and shortly after reinstated to the Cabinet."471,The Star,12/29/2012,Less People Reported Corruption Last Year,,KENYA (76%),,Newspaper,Macharia Wamugo,ENGLISH,,31-Dec-12,,70 words,ETHICS (90%); ANNUAL REPORTS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%) Kenya; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,  The number of reports received by the Ethics and anti corruption commission reduced by 26.4 % to 5230 this year as compared to 7109 last year according to this years annual report.

NIS will check with the Kenya Revenue Authority to ensure that the proposed nominees are tax compliant as well as the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to ensure that they are not corrupt. Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto want to prepare a list that will not have problems in Parliament when they present it for vetting. They do not want nominees to have ongoing cases or investigations related to corruption or abuse of office. Some past ministers and politicians have already been disqualified for involvement in scandals including the running of the Constituency Development Funds. ""There are at least four senior politicians who were ministers in the grand coalition government that the president and the deputy president have already struck out of their initial list out of their questionable past in running of public affairs. A number of Permanent Secretaries who were to be promoted will also be shocked,"" a senior government official said. Speaker Justin Muturi and MPs have already warned that the National Assembly will not rubber-stamp the nominees and those on the list should be prepared for thorough vetting. Uhuru and Ruto have already prepared a list of 19 Cabinet Secretaries including six women but have eight names spare in case some of their nominees are rejected. The Constitution requires them to select a minimum of 14 Cabinet Secretaries and a maximum of 22. They are likely to announce the Cabinet nominees with some youthful and new faces on Monday, the day before Parliament reconvenes on Tuesday. ""There are some names that keep on being mentioned in the media. Very many of them especially current ministers will be surprised when the list is out. They (Uhuru and Ruto) have concentrated on experience and knowledge instead of political patronage. It is a delicate balancing act,"" said a senior Jubilee member. Parliament will start sitting on April 16 and one of its first duties will be to set up various House committees. The Committee on Appointments will vet the nominees before presenting them for approval to the National Assembly. The Committee will also invite the public to make submissions on the nominees who will be grilled publicly on their qualifications, experience and integrity. Uhuru, 51, and Ruto, 46, have concentrated on identifying young professionals of around the same age to take up the cabinet roles as well as other positions in their offices and State House.

They were protesting alleged corruption at the Mariakani weighbridge. The drivers said weighbridge officials are selective in their weighing of loads. Some of the drivers blamed brokers at the weighbridge for perennial snarl-ups. The protest, which started at around 10am yesterday, caused a major traffic jam that stretched for 20km in both directions Kenya Long Distance Truck Drivers and Allied Workers Union Mombasa branch secretary Roma Waema, who rushed to the scene, said some trucks are usually deliberately delayed at the weighbridge. ""If you don't 'speak their language' they will make you wait for hours or even days before they weigh your vehicle,"" said Waema. Muslim for Human Rights rapid response officer Francis Auma who was caught in the jam as he travelled from Nairobi was allegedly slapped by a senior officer at the weighbridge as he tried to inquire what was going on. ""This is something that has been going on for quite a while but there is still no permanent solution,"" said Auma. Frederick Mutisya, a driver with Pema Digital Services, said overloaded trucks are usually made to wait along the highway for an opportune time to be sneaked in and out of the weighbridge unpunished. ""The brokers are the people who run things at the weighbridge. They tell trucks when to pass and when not to pass. They usually wait for the big bosses to move out before they deal with the smaller officers,"" said Mutisya. Mombasa senator Hassan Omar said the matter was listed for discussion in the senate yesterday at 6pm. He said the traffic jams hinder businesses and may lead to major loss of business for counties using the highway especially at the Coast.

From a moral point of view, it is indefensible, that the MPs who are very well aware of the kind of poverty in which most Kenyans live, should demand salaries more befitting legislators of an advanced industrial nation. From a macroeconomic point of view, it is a storm in a teacup. Kenya may be a poor country, but a few hundred Mercedes Benzes and a few hundred MPs drawing a million shillings a month each, is not going to destroy the economy. Indeed the proposed pay cut for MPs, is very much like the initiative by President Uhuru Kenyatta when he was Finance minister, in which he had ministerial Mercedes Benzes recalled, and VW Passats offered to ministers instead. Replacing the cream of German engineering with another top-level German car was really more a token gesture than a serious policy change. So too with the reduced salaries for MPs. If there was any serious intent in reducing government expenditure, it would have to begin with the massive--and completely opaque-- expenditures of the Ministry of Defense and the Office of the President. But there is one more significant perspective in all this: the purely political perspective. And from this point of view we would ask this question: What else did you expect? For many years, Kenyans from all walks of life have been in agreement that our Presidents have far too much power. And also that this power was routinely abused. As recently as two or three years ago, and under the new constitution, we had former President Kibaki appointing ""county commissioners"" while knowing full well that there was no provision for any such appointments under the new constitution. And yet not only did Kibaki appoint them, but he refused to have them recalled to other duties when objections were raised. The new constitution was supposed to cure us from these excesses of presidential power, in which the imperious decrees of one man had the force of law, even when such decrees were actually in direct violation of what we knew to be in our statute books. Further, the power taken away from the presidency was supposed to be vested in various other institutions--the Judiciary, Parliament and the new county governments, in particular. But power is power, no matter who exercises it. And if power had proved to be corrosive and corrupting to the presidency, why would we imagine that it would be any less corrosive or corrupting when it was exercised by the Judiciary, Parliament or by county governors? To my mind, nothing is more natural than that the MPs, finding themselves as part of an independent institution vested with legislative powers, would seek to use their authority to increase their salaries. And that in doing so, they would have as little regard for constitutionalism as Kibaki had when he appointed all those county commissioners. We have seen successive Presidents succumb to the temptations of power and the lures of arbitrary rule. So why should we be surprised if the Judiciary or Parliament goes down the same path? Of course there are barriers in the way of these MPs: for one, the Salaries and Remuneration Commission exists precisely to thwart such moves as those recently undertaken by Parliament. And as a last resort, the SRC can take up the matter in court, and seek judicial interpretation of its powers to establish salary levels for the MPs. This clash of constitutional organs of state, contrary to popular opinion, is not a sign of national collapse. It is actually proof that the constitution is working as it is supposed to. Democracy presupposes the existence of antagonistic forces which will pull in different ways and seek opposing ends. There was never going to be peace and tranquility between the SRC and Parliament. The two organs of state were bound to clash sooner or later. And it is only appropriate that they should. When we sought to limit presidential power which was so conspicuously abused under the old constitution, we should have known that the abuse of power would not vanish, but only be assumed by other organs of state. There is a simple way of expressing this in layman's terms: Nothing in life is free. And something as important as the diminishing of presidential power, must come at a steep cost."483,The Star,7/11/2013,Corruption Index Not Major Investor Concern - Keninvest,,"KENYA (95%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); LIBERIA (92%); GERMANY (90%); SUDAN (79%); ETHIOPIA (79%); NORTHERN ASIA (79%); AFRICA (79%)",,Newspaper,Lola Okulo,ENGLISH,,11-Jul-13,"BERLIN, GERMANY (90%); NAIROBI, KENYA (74%)",266 words,CORRUPTION (93%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); TRADE DEVELOPMENT (78%); COMPUTING & IT SECTOR PERFORMANCE (78%); TALKS & MEETINGS (77%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (73%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (70%); COUNTIES (66%); CONSTRUCTION (64%); TEXTILE MFG (50%) Kenya; Corruption,"KENYA Investment Authority has downplayed the impact the recent corruption index could have on the investors appetite but admits more needs to be done to curb the vice.

""Part of our ongoing conversation with Kenya is addressing a host of issues in the business environment,"" says David Renz, a counselor for Economic Affairs at the US Embassy Nairobi. ""We are closely watching the commitments of the Kenyatta administration for addressing corruption."" AGOA, a US bill lowering tariffs for African exports, began in 2000 with a proposed lifespan of fifteen years. Since its inception, trade has increased from $2.6 billion to $22.6 billion in 2012. In 2012, Kenya exported $380 million worth of goods under AGOA. In the Export Processing Zones, where 25,000 people are employed, exports contributed $262 million. An AGOA forum will be held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia between August 12 and 13. The US will aim to extend the agreement for 15 to 20 years. There are two main reasons an extension is being sought. First, many African products cannot compete in American markets. This remains a reality in Kenya. ""AGOA has provided incentives for economic growth in the formal sector, where Kenya is trying to create jobs,"" says Renz, ""But, we still have to have a product that meets market needs in the US and is manufactured at a competitive price."" Several roadblocks for Kenyan production costs include transportation issues and the price of electricity. The second reason concerns Africa's fast growing economies and Obama's focus on the region. ""It's no secret that the president views Africa as a key place,"" said John Anderson, an assistant secretary in the US department of commerce. ""We want to take advantage of the opportunities during the promising future the continent is poised to have."" AGOA is currently eligible to 39 African countries, under strict compliance rules. Each year, countries are assessed on their governance and human rights records. Numerous African countries, as a result, have been barred from trading. This year, Kenya's widely reported corruption will be under the microscope. ""If there is corruption that is rampant, we will go in and talk to them about it,"" says Florizelle Liser, the assistant US Trade Representative for Africa. The bill's extension is being debated in congress this week. Many are confident it will pass. ""We are very, very focused on what we have to do with congress and AGOA stakeholders,"" says Liser."487,The Star,8/17/2013,Can Rule of Reason Save Kenya From the Arms of Corruption [opinion],,KENYA (94%); GREECE (90%),,Newspaper,Koigi Wamwere,ENGLISH,,19-Aug-13,"ATHENS, GREECE (90%)",885 words,"CORRUPTION (90%); POLITICAL SCIENCE (90%); PHILOSOPHY (90%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (90%); POLITICS (87%); WEALTHY PEOPLE (85%); CLASSICS (77%); CORPORATE WRONGDOING (74%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (67%) Kenya; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Economy, Business and Finance","To have the rule of reason however, we must have leaders who are not afraid or too lazy to think, reason, read in search of knowledge and solve problems. Without eyes of knowledge, a leader and his people will be blind. I have been re-reading my Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Mahatma Gandhi, Niccolo Machiavelli, Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx and any other philosopher I think can help me answer questions on why Kenya is rotting so fast and what we must do to save ourselves. In the journey of my mind, I have stumbled upon another question: If rule of reason has saved others elsewhere, can it save Kenya. To transform ancient Athens, which mistakenly called itself a democracy, the great philosopher Plato said, Athens the city of corruption needed the rule of reason for her salvation. Like Plato, I believe Kenya whose corporate corruption has been rated number one in the world and mistakenly also calls itself a democracy, also needs the rule of reason to liberate herself from the iron arms of the octopus of corruption, poverty, negative ethnicity, unemployment, fear and desperation, depressions and suicide, insanity, recklessness, beastliness and death wish. Plato called for the rule of reason because he believed, though Hindu philosophers accused politics of corruption, as long as people were neither gods nor beasts, they would remain political animals and through political philosophers armed with power of knowledge of science of politics, power could be exercised wisely and incorruptly for the good of society. How could men then construct rule of reason that did not corrupt them? Plato thought human nature was such that men had three faculties - replicable in a civil state - of reason by philosopher rulers, courage of soldiers, appetite or greed of farmers and men of commerce. Here in Kenya, the Kikuyu thought like the Greeks. The country belonged to the man of wisdom - muthamaki, the man of courage - njamba and the man of wealth - gitonga. The masses lived in the country they did not own. In this pre-colonial society, power was not given to the warrior or rich man but to the man of reason. Unfortunately today, power is not entrusted to the ruler of reason. It is sold by voters and bought by the rich man and later bequeathed to his children. After buying leadership, the rich man uses resources of the state for self enrichment and protection by the man of courage. Kenya is not led by reason of the philosopher president or by the soldier. It is led by the appetite and greed of the rich man - the capitalist. Under the rule of appetite and greed, problems of society grow worse by the day. As in ancient Athens, corruption is king. We no longer suffer shame for corruption. Graft has eaten into democracy and left a mere shell of it. As ideology of hate pitted Athens against Spartan, negative ethnicity also pits community against community. As corruption engenders the wealth of the rich, equally, it engenders mental and material poverty of the poor. As we watch, insanity grips society while gun and greed reduce society to a jungle of carnivores and herbivores. We are self-destructing and rule of reason must save us with the science of politics as well as engineering, medicine, mathematics, chemistry and physics. To have the rule of reason however, we must have leaders who are not afraid or too lazy to think, reason, read in search of knowledge and solve problems. Without eyes of knowledge, a leader and his people will be blind. Rule of reason is impossible without a renaissance and an age of reason. Already we have lost an entire jubilee of missed opportunity to think out our development. And we shall lose another jubilee of reason if we don't end leadership of wealth instead of ideas, knowledge and wisdom. If we shall self-liberate, we must read and seek knowledge like mad. Rule of reason is impossible where leadership is sold by voters and bought by men and women of appetite and greed or taken with guns by soldiers. Finally, rule of reason cannot germinate in the soil of hunger or intellectual poverty because starvation kills thought and reason. To foster reason, we must read but our reading culture is dead with mobile phones taking the place of books. If 29 per cent of Kenyans live by superstition, more than 11 million hardly reason or think and will not welcome the rule of reason. In 'The Brothers Karamazov', novel by Fydol Dostoevsky of Russia, the Grand Inquisitor argues that Christianity captures its unthinking flock with miracles, mystic and authority, instruments of perfect unreason against freedom. As deadly brew kills minds of the youth, more deadly opium of negative ethnicity keeps Kenyan communities at each other's throat. Unfortunately, it is easier not to think and steal, than think and work. And as reasoning and thinking were subversive to elders of Athens who condemned Socrates to die by drinking hemlock, many in Kenyan government would today also condemn a true thinker and pursuer of truth to death and use every trick to draw people from thinking. Not to kill another Socrates or Jesus, we must have rule of reason. Sadly, Kenyans are driven by appetite and greed, not by pursuit of truth, excellence, goodness, justice and morality. This is why our society is rotting, retrogressing, dying collectively and our problems getting worse."488,The Star,8/21/2013,Shollei Says Corruption Allegations Untrue,,KENYA (93%),,Newspaper,Lydia Matata,ENGLISH,,21-Aug-13,,632 words,CORRUPTION (90%); TALKS & MEETINGS (89%); APPELLATE DECISIONS (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (78%); SUBCONTRACTING (77%); INVESTIGATIONS (77%); RELOCATIONS (72%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (72%); RECRUITMENT & HIRING (68%); APPEALS COURTS (64%) Kenya; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Chief Deputy Registrar of the Judiciary Gladys Shollei has appeared before the legal and Justice Affairs Committee today to discuss issues surrounding her 15 day suspension from office by the Judicial Service Commission. The JSC suspended Shollei on Monday to pave way for investigations into corruption allegations made against the her. While fielding questions on members of the JSC who she may have issues with, Shollei confirmed that she has had issues with commissioner's Ahmednassir, Ominde and Warsame whom she accused of frustrating her work. She said Commissioner Ominde has ""fought her from the very beginning"". She said she has had to write several letters to Chief Justice Willy Mutunga asking the CJ to explain her role in relation to Ominde's. She stated that she answers to the full JSC and not individual commissioners. She further stated that Commissioner Warsame had ""taunted me about hiring people"" claiming that on several occasion Warsame remarked that her predecessor hired ""upto 30 people for him."" Shollei further said she is yet to receive any information about the charges against her or the reasons that members of the JSC decided to send her on compulsory leave following a vote of 5-4 in favour of the proposal. Adding that she is yet to see the minutes of the meeting held over the weekend Shollei also sought to clarify issues touching on the purchase of buildings and other materials acquired by the Judiciary. She told the committee that contrary to allegations the judiciary has not purchased any building in Mombasa as reported. She said lawyers had complained over the Court of Appeal being located in Malindi, but she explained that the building was purchased before her tenure. She said she has been working on implementing the Judiciary's policy to relocate the court to Mombasa. She said the Judiciary is still scouting for a suitable building to house the court stating that she has received an offer from the Postal cooperation and has written a letter to the organization to ascertain whether there building is suitable and whether the corporation is a government body adding that she is yet to receive a response from the cooperation. On the issue of constructions at the Milimani Commercial Courts, Shollei said that during her tenure she received complaints about the building over issues such as substandard internet and telephone connectivity as well as problems with the ceiling which was reportedly about to cave in. She said she convened a meeting of the subcontractors working on the building after which they agreed they had not completed work on the building and agreed to correct the error with no additional cost to the Judiciary. She further stated that additional work at the Courts cost Sh230 million and not Sh1 billion as alleged. The Chief Registrar of the Judiciary also confirmed that vehicles have been purchased for newly recruited Judges stating that it was the policy of the Judiciary to purchase Mercedes Benz for judges. On the leasing of office premises, Shollei said the Judiciary is renting new premises as the Supreme Court cannot house the 30 judges currently operating in the court. She said the Judiciary is following a six year plan in which they will rent premises for the first year but by the six year would have purchased a new building. She added that the Supreme Court is also currently undergoing renovations which greatly required as it was first built in 1930. She said the JSC has been furnished with all the information on the projects. Shollei said she has refused to say anything in camera saying that she has nothing to hide. Shollei further said the accusations about her being militant are true stating that ""Yes I do not apologize about it."" She said her style of management is only not acceptable when its a woman."489,The Star,8/26/2013,Corruption Will Not Be Condoned in the Ministry of Education.,,KENYA (79%),,Newspaper,Alice Waweru,ENGLISH,,27-Aug-13,,39 words,EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (92%); CORRUPTION (90%) Kenya; Corruption; Education,"  We will deal ruthlessly with Ministry of Education officials found to be involved in corruption.

Kenyans are split on whether the government is committed to devolution, a report by Transparency International suggests. Of the 1,766 surveyed in the report 51.8 per cent felt that the government is committed to devolution with 72.7 per cent saying the disbursement of funds to counties is a show of the this commitment. This reason was also rated most highly by the 48.2 per cent who felt that the national government is not committed to the process by 42.7 per cent. A further 42.2 per cent said that the central government is still interfering with county affairs. Corruption was rated as the largest threats to devolution by responded with 35. 9 per cent saying this is the biggest threat. Lack of adequate funds was also rated as a possible threat with 21.5 per cent , followed by political interferences at 20.5 per cent and supremacy wrangles within the county and central government by 18.3 per cent Majority of the respondents, 43.7 per cent are also satisfied with the performance of county governments. However a larger majority of 83 per cent said they had no knowledge of how funds have been allocated to their respective counties. Majority, 56 per cent also did not know where to get information on funds allocation. The report also reveals that even though majority believed priorities of the national government were good, 37.1 per cent of them viewed them as unrealistic as compared to only 30.5 per cent respondents who thought county governments' priorities were unrealistic. Further, about a sixth of the respondents view the development priorities to be out of touch with the needs of citizens at both county and national level. Launching the report, Transparency International Kenya (TI-Kenya's) Executive Director Mr. Samuel Kimeu noted that citizens' views on the national and county governments' priorities could be a pointer to the governments to revisit campaign priorities and to align them with what the people identify as real and urgent needs through paying fidelity to the participatory planning process enshrined in law. ""The public response to our poll is indicative of the lack of peoples' voice in the setting of development priorities."" Said Mr Kimeu Kimeu cautioned that if corruption goes unchecked, it will undermine the developmental aspirations of Kenyans at both levels of government. ""Merely lamenting about widespread corruption will never address the scourge. Being responsible and well informed citizens, it is our duty to our nation and future generations to take individual and collective steps to stop corruption in our society. "" The judiciary was seen as the most trusted institution in driving the anti-corruption agenda with close to 30 per cent respondents supporting this assertion. The confidence in the civil society and EACC stood at 20 per cent and 17 per cent respectively The survey was conducted across 31 counties and eight regions. Across the regions, Rift Valley accounted for the largest number of respondents with about 28 per cent of the total while North Eastern accounted for the lowest number at 4.1 per cent respondents. The survey respondents were mainly between 18-49 year olds with an almost equal split between 18-29 and 30-49 years age brackets. Only 10 per cent of the sample was picked from Kenyans above 50 years. According to Transparency International the two demographic groups were purposely sampled as a reflection of the national population. The organization said that this group is also likely to be more impacted by success or otherwise of such critical issues like improved governance into the future."492,The Star,10/1/2013,Transparency International Launches Report On Corruption in Education.,,KENYA (79%),,Newspaper,Sharon Mwangi,ENGLISH,,1-Oct-13,,220 words,CORRUPTION (92%); EMBEZZLEMENT (78%); EDUCATION FUNDING (73%) Kenya; Corruption; Education,"Transparency International in a new report shows says stepping up the fight against corruption in education is necessary not only to keep children in school and meet literacy and development goals, but also to ensure that the next generation is prepared to say no to corruption. According to the organization's Global Corruption Report,in order to prevent corruption from becoming commonplace, promoting integrity among young people is critical to building a better future. This report seeks to shed light on the many shapes and forms of corrupt practices in education, be they the embezzlement of national education funds, hidden school costs or the buying and selling of fake degrees. Huguette Labelle, Chair of Transparency International emphasizes on the need to sensitize and create awareness for the young people on corruption: ""For schools to educate the corruption fighters of tomorrow they need to be free from corruption themselves. Without a strong dose of integrity, our schools and universities will fail to provide future leaders with the basic tools needed to succeed, and more importantly, to combat graft.

The interim report by the task force set up in August by Mining Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala to look into issuance of licenses issued this year revealed massive irregularities. ""In some instances, licences were issued to entities that at the time of application for the said licences were not incorporated and neither possessed a certificate of incorporation nor a business name registration,"" stated the report. ""Some licences were issued even though financial capability was not demonstrated by the applicant and in some instances no financial documents are supporting the documents as required by law."" In August, Balala ordered for a review of all the licenses issued from January and cancelled 43 licenses that were issued from March noting that the rush to issue licenses during the transition period when a new government was taking over was very suspicious. He said it was questionable the way some individuals had been issued with mining licenses yet their exploration and financial capability was not clear. Out of the 43 companies whose licenses were revoked by Balala, the report said only 28 out of these had fully received their licenses with the rest being at various stages of consideration for different types of licenses, the report said. The task force investigating the matter found that in some cases, the law was blatantly flouted. ""Whereas possession of a valid prospecting right is a requirement for the issuance of exclusive prospecting licences (EPLs) and special licences, some licences were issued where the applicants did not have valid PRs,"" said the report. The task force which is chaired by lawyer Mohamed Nyaoga is supposed to issue a complete report within 60 days after its setup and will also be required to recommend measures for developing processes and institutions to effectively comply with the licensing procedures. After reviewing licenses for this year, Balala, who eyes overhaul of the entire mining sector, said he will ask the task force to start investigations into the other licenses issued between 2003 to end 2012."494,The Star,10/12/2013,Corruption Has Finally Arrived At the Mara [opinion],,KENYA (90%),,Newspaper,Steve Kinuthia,ENGLISH,,14-Oct-13,,642 words,CORRUPTION (90%); CAMPING (89%); TRAVEL  HOSPITALITY & TOURISM (74%); MOVIE FILMING (70%) Kenya; Corruption,"Corruption is indeed contagious. When it happens in one sector, it soon spreads and infects even those who seem immune to it. Yours truly has pointed out from time to time, the rot in some parks, and especially the Maasai Mara reserve. In most cases, it has been a question of bad roads, bribes to the authorities to overlook a driver coming home late from game drive, or bribing to be allowed to off-road, especially those who deal with commercial documentary filming. One would see some foreign registered vehicles with a sign at the back reading ""do not follow off-road"" and posing as filming crew but turns out to be a normal tourist on a self-drive safari but who happened to know how Kenyan operates. So to say, corruption in the bush had been, for a long time, something we can bear. Not anymore. Having been quiet for a long time, the security guys posted to man different areas in Mara, are literally running after the disappearing dollars. They do not even hide their act. They do it in full daylight and with little regard that a client may be be able to recognise them in case there is a call for identification parade. They know they are 'covered'. I was in Mara last week. I chose to be on the Mara conservancy side since I have always felt that this part of Mara has more sanity in its operations. I had begun my game drive as early as 6am. The purpose of the early bird wake up time, was to have time to see the sunrise and still be able to cross the mara bridge in time to chance a crossing from the conservancy side. At the Mara bridge, the process of verification of the tickets went on smoothly, as I had anticipated. They are still on the modified digitalised payment method while the Narok side of the divide has moved back to the hand written ticketing despite having moved with time and introduced the card system. It cannot be said that the card system was wrong. Just the spoon getting smaller. Into the game drive, the time for a short stop by the river to have coffee, was calling. As has been my preference for all times, I chose a well-established campsite to offload the clients and chose a spot to lay the table. Just as I was removing my camping chairs, I heard a movement in the thickets that surround the campsite. A Land Rover was approaching. When it finally arrived, a lone tourist came out, followed by a uniformed guard, who was carrying a gun. Without even introducing himself, he proceeded to where I was setting out the table and asked me why I was endangering my clients by having them come out of the van at such a hidden spot. He was speaking in English, to make sure that my clients understood what he was saying and maybe side with him. What he did not know was that my clients were here for an umpteenth time, and had used the same spot for breakfast on countless occasions over the years. He also did not know that, that was an old school trick to scare the clients in order to minimize bargaining when he mentions his real intention of the abrupt interruption of our tea break. The rules were all written on his face and his tone said it all. No bargain. Drive to the bridge and pay the fine of Sh10000, or share ""chai"" and save the valuable time for game drive. Just then, we heard the noises of water splashing violently close to where we were. Wildebeests were crossing. A quick calculation went through my head. Since there was no bargain, I could also benefit a little from his presence. I gave him my clients, to escort them to where the crossing was happening, on foot. It was going to be a new experience for them, and my money was not going to be in vain. One thing was clear though. The rot had finally caught up with Mr Brian of the Mara conservancy. I know he has nothing to do with the process of posting the GSU at the Mara bridge, but let him be informed that the disease is now at his backyard."495,The Star,11/11/2013,Kiambu Coffee Society Closed Over Corruption,,KENYA (79%),,Newspaper,Joseph Gicheha,ENGLISH,,11-Nov-13,,284 words,CORRUPTION (90%); AGRICULTURE (90%); COFFEE (90%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%); CLOSINGS (78%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (77%); AGRICULTURAL CHEMICALS (74%); FARMERS & RANCHERS (74%); CORN FARMING (73%); APPOINTMENTS (72%); FERTILIZERS (69%) Kenya; Corruption; Agribusiness; Company News,"THE Komothai Coffee Cooperative Society has been closed.

They accused county cooperative commissioner Ephraim Mathenge of colluding with officials to steal from the society. The members said they have lost Sh25 million and the society owes the Cooperative Bank Sh52 million. ""The society's workers have not been paid for the past four months. That is why we are giving the government three months to investigate where Sh10 million and another Sh15 million it gave to the society for fertiliser was taken,"" said Rebecca Wairimu Njihia. ""Years back our families benefited greatly from coffee. Now it would be better to close this society, uproot the crop and start farming maize instead.

""He should be appointed in consultation with farmers not by the board which works in cahoots with them to steal from us,"" said John Mburu. ""We used to give loans to the government in 1967. We used to produce 16 million tonnes of coffee. We are now producing 17, 000. The officials are corrupt and they never release accounts to us for perusal.""

In Kenya, research surveys continue to show corruption as an integral part of our daily pains, a problem over which we have no power. Though corruption eats into our soul every day, reducing our ability to reject it, we cannot surrender and must as often as possible take a position against it. At the very least, this will make us cleaner people. Even though we may disbelieve, it reassures every time President Uhuru Kenyatta announces his intention to fight corruption, important because no war against corruption can succeed unless the president leads it. However, it is my considered view that Kenyans should not place too much hope on President Uhuru ending corruption since neither him nor Ruto are ideological foes of corruption. Most of our problems stem from corruption because it distorts our economy from solving to creating problems. In short, corruption means stealing from others and gearing our thoughts and activities to actualising theft. Corruption also makes enemies of all those who will steal from one another. Other than creating poverty, anger and enemies, corruption also makes government and country private property of leaders; takes food from the mouths of babies; kills the sick in hospitals, lets in terrorists to kill; allows defective vehicles onto our roads to kill thousands; allows criminals to steal hundreds of billions from government coffers; kills youth with drugs and alcohol; sells leadership to thieves and bars persons of integrity from leadership. President Uhuru and Deputy President Ruto cannot eliminate corruption because they believe in capitalism, the mother of graft and the ideology of greed. Corruption in Kenya is everywhere, polluting the soul of every individual and every institution. It is in government, in schools, in the police, on roads, in hospitals, in media, in churches, everywhere. We wrongly believe fighting corruption only means arresting and jailing corrupt people. The harder part is teaching the entire country the ideals and taboos of fighting graft. As in fighting disease, in fighting graft, prevention is better than cure. Many doubt President Uhuru's intention to wage war against corruption because, in a country flooded by corruption, we see no casualties paraded in courts for corruption, we hear no protestations against arrest and prosecution, and there are no anticorruption campaigns in our cities, towns, villages, schools, churches, radios and televisions. Corruption cannot be fought in silence. President Uhuru has power and enjoys goodwill to fight corruption. But to fight graft he needs more than power. He needs own reasons to declare war against graft, political will to fight and total conviction that corruption is his personal enemy. Yet to regard corruption as a personal enemy, graft need to have hurt President Uhuru at a personal level. Has it? If Uhuru and Ruto have benefited more from graft than they have been hurt by it, their war against graft will be stillborn. To realise difficulties of fighting corruption we need to acknowledge its various tentacles. Most fundamental is corruption inherent in capitalism, our economic system or socialism gone mad. Where there is corruption of the system, fighting it will require revolutionary efforts. But if our leaders believe in capitalism, they cannot fight it and profit from the system. Corruption is very difficult to fight when it is founded on greed, the ideology of capitalism that we don't currently question - theft is fair, exploitation is smart and loot is legitimate. It is fair for a smart thief to keep his loot if he is uncaught. If President Uhuru and Deputy President Ruto have decided to fight graft, they will find it easier to fight petty than grand corruption. After all, petty thieves will not come from their class. President Uhuru might even believe that old graft no longer smells and may no longer need fighting like raw corruption which still smells foul. But logic will dictate equality of treatment between old and new graft. If Uhuru and Ruto benefited from old graft, fighting new graft will be impossible. Experience also teaches that fighting the corruption of other people from other places and communities is easier than fighting corruption of our family members, friends and ethnic communities. Ultimately the most difficult corruption is graft that has captured power and is in government. It will use government resources to defend itself. It is lack of ideological capacity and political will that researched and investigated corruption as reported in Controller and Auditor General, Ndung'u Report, Transparency International and TJRC has not been prosecuted by various Kenyan governments including this one of Uhuru and Ruto. Kenyan corruption has progressed in quantity and quality and no longer cares about life. Like mafia, it kills those who will expose or wish to eradicate it. The worst is our moral corruption that kills soul of the nation and individuals we read about everyday killing spouses and children in homes and often, uncaring drivers and travelers on our roads. Kenyan corruption has grown intractable because it does not fight alone. It is has allies in negative ethnicity that will protect ""own"" graft and political leaders who resort to corruption to win elections."500,The Star,11/19/2013,New Body to Fight Corruption,,KENYA (88%),,Newspaper,George Murage,ENGLISH,,19-Nov-13,,82 words,CORRUPTION (92%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (90%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (88%); COUNTIES (88%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (86%) Kenya; Corruption; Governance,"The National Assembly and county assemblies have formed a new organisation to fight corruption.

The EACC is probing claims the company was irregularly awarded the contract shortly before the elections. It is alleged that Oritere Builders is associated with the driver of a senior employee of the Laikipia county government. EACC is investigating allegations that the Laikipia County government officials purported to have awarded a tender to renovate the Kinamba governor's office to Oritere Builders and Construction Company associated with senior county officials days before governors were elected and when such tenders had been stopped by the then Secretary to the Cabinet and Head of Civil Service Francis Kimemia. The investigators are trying to establish how Oritere Builders were awarded the tender for renovation of office, construction of public toilet, governors, toilet, installation of electricity/wiring, installation of water tank and leveling of parking two moths before the historic General Election that saw the forty seven governors elected for the first time in the country. The tender was allegedly awarded on February 5 2013 after the Transition Authority stopped any such transactions by County, Municipal and City councils. Oritere Builders and Construction company wrote their acceptance letter on February 8 2013 to the Town Council of Rumuruti. According to County Government internal audit report sent to the EACC and Transitional Authority, there was no contract documents was given for the renovation and repairs to the governor's office in Kinamaba nor were architectural designs provided.

Worst East African countries involved in bribery and corruption cases are: Uganda with 26.8 per cent, Burundi 18.6 per cent, Tanzania 12.9 per cent, Kenya number 4 with 7.9 per cent and then Rwanda with 4.4 per cent bribery index. Releasing the report on Friday at Kaskazi Beach hotel in Diani-Kwale Transparency International program officer Coast region, Francis Kaeru said they managed to talk to 2245 people in about 45 counties in Kenya on the issue of bribery and corruption. The report ranked police department number one among the governments departments which asks for bribe for them to give services to Kenyans for the last six years since they started releasing the annual report on bribery and corruption in East Africa. Kaeru said that police are followed by Registry and licensing department and third department is the Judiciary. He said that out of ten governments departments Police, Judiciary and lands ministry officials are worst corrupt with 70.7 per cent, 46.7 per cent and 38.3 per cent respectively. ""Land ministry is leading in taking the highest bribe of Sh8, 949, Judiciary is the second taking Sh8, 390, County and local councils take Sh5, 637 while police take Sh4, 411. That is the average size of bribe that those departments ask from wananchi if they go to get services from their offices,"" he said. Kaeru said that it is amazing that Judiciary which Kenyans had been trusted to reform that it takes double the bribe which police ask from locals so that they can serve them. ""Most of Kenyans said that they give bribe so that they can get services quickly from government officials and to avoid trouble with authority among other reasons according to the survey. That means service delivery by government officials to wananchi is very poor because of bribery,"" he added. He said that the survey also indicates that the level of bribe and corruption among government officials in the country since August 2012 and August 2013 has increased. Kaeru said that out of 10 Kenyans who were interviewed only 1would report bribe and corruption cases if he or she is asked to pay bribe. ""Over 90 per cent Kenyans decline reporting bribe and corruption cases to agencies tasked to deal with such cases like Ethics and Ant-corruption commission (EACC) Transparency International according to our survey while only 10 per cent reports bribery cases, ""he said. The TI official said that although cases of corruption are increasing everyday no reports are made on the same by those affected. He said that if nothing is done to curb the vice then corruption in the next one year to come will be worst urging Kenyans, leaders and organizations to stand together and fight corruption. Transparency International recommendations are; improving service delivery by sacking government officials found corrupt like it is the manifesto of the Jubilee government and coming up with laws to help in dealing with corruption especially empowering ant-corruption body. County governments to have laws to govern them in using public funds and locals to be sensitized that giving bribe is illegal and government service are ones rights. The organization also recommended that Kenyans should report corrupt cases to relevant organizations for action to be taken in curbing corruption in the country."509,The Star,1/1/2014,IFMIS Will End Corruption in the Counties [opinion],,KENYA (79%),,Newspaper,Dr Njoroge Obadiah Kimani,ENGLISH,,2-Jan-14,,648 words,COUNTIES (92%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (91%); TREASURY DEPARTMENTS (89%); CORRUPTION (89%); PUBLIC FINANCE (78%); MISCONDUCT (77%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (76%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (74%); ECONOMIC NEWS (73%); EVIDENCE (72%); ARRESTS (71%); CONSTITUTIONAL LAW (67%) Kenya; Corruption; Governance; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Over the last few months, there has been hue and cry over the Integrated Financial Information System (IFMIS) accounting system adopted by Treasury some years ago. Most of the blame heaped on IFMIS is neither sincere nor innocent. The ""institutional resistance"" to IFMIS has everything to do with the system's ability to deter financial impropriety and crime - period! Those criticizing the IFMIS system for alleged systematic inefficiency forget to say that poor exposure of the workings of the system is normal with any technology. Instead of demonizing technology, they should be familiarizing themselves with the workings of this crucial solution to public finance management. With the devolution of huge amounts of financial resources to the 47 counties, the adoption of the IFMIS is now more critical than at any other time in our history. Operations of most of the 47 county governments have been slowed or even plagued by teething challenges that can be arrested. Providing a solution to financial management at the county level will forestall corruptions at the lower tiers of government and ensure that development will finally 'trickle down' to the grassroots. Treasury has a role in ensuring that county governments adopt the IFMIS system since it has the mandate to implement systems that would lead to better management of the financial resources accruing to the county governments. And contrary to those who believe that county governments have absolute control of the financial resources handed over to them by the national government, 'our' devolution is based on a system of interdependence and cooperation between the two levels of government. Some of the objectives of devolution are to promote social and economic development as well as the provision of ""proximate, easily accessible services throughout the country."" To enable them function properly, the constitution has enabled the counties to access reliable sources of revenue for governance and delivery of services in an effective manner. But what have we done to ensure that the official delegation of authority and massive financial resources does not result to the devolvement of grand corruption and the likely malfeasance it can yield? Although county governments have the power to administer and spend revenue, the experience we've had since independence is that their predecessors, local authorities, lacked the capacity to do so. As a result, most had insufficient resources to run their affairs. But there is also compelling evidence that even the limited amount of resources they acquired was drained off by corrupt officials. This is definitely not what we want the new county governments to replicate and hence the need for the IFMIS system. Under the Constitution, the 47 county governments are empowered to raise and spend all their revenues, but also to share what is collected by the national government. This means that cash collected from across the country must be shared by all including in places where very little of it was collected. Therefore, it is only right that such cash is used for the purpose for which it was allocated in the first place and for the entire county to adopt absolute transparency and a watertight system of ensuring accountability. In more ways than one, IFMIS ensure this. The Cabinet Secretary in-charge of the national treasury has the powers to stop the transfer of finances including 50 per cent of the funds allocated to a county government whenever there is sufficient evidence of misuse of public finances. The adoption of IFMIS by the national government in 1998 and its extension into ministries and public institutions is properly within the law. What is now needed is for it to be extended to county governments so that wananchi can get a value for their money.

Most of it self-inflicted through incompetence, corruption, tribalism, nepotism and intolerance of its leaders. On December 3rd, 2013, South Sudanese President, Salva Kiir Mayardit, sensationally claimed that he had quashed a coup attempt by his former Vice-President Dr. Riek Machar, when many knew that Kiir was only trying to consolidate his iron hold on power ahead of what many South Sudanese expected to be a remarkable ruling party leadership convention a few days away. South Sudan has had a troubled history. When it eventually won her independence in 2011 after decades of a withering and devastating liberation war, many South Sudanese breathed a sigh of relief and exuberantly hoped that their country would provide them with basic social services that they have lacked for centuries. However, installed in Juba in 2011 was a thoroughly incompetent and corrupt group of former guerrillas with little, if any, democratic credentials. All they had was military experience. They had been suddenly thrust into top leadership of a new state in a modern, technologically advanced world five years before under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. They were like crawling kids on a canvas. They were most likely going to hurt themselves and cause a mess. What I saw when I attended the South Sudan independence inauguration on July 9, 2011 was a ragtag, weather-beaten, weary and hungry former guerrilla leaders wearing pinstriped suites. Although the inauguration had been planned for a long period of time, they hadn't even constructed a mini-stadium for the event in the five years they had been in power under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Not had they thought of hiring a large tent for the occasion if they couldn't construct a stadium. The event was embarrassingly held at the Dr. John Garang de Mabior Mausoleum. And as we waited for hours for the sombre occasion to begin, virtually all the former SPLA/SPLM guerrillas arrived in brand new air-conditioned Mercedes and MBW 4x4 vehicles. I was stunned by this unnecessary opulence and obvious misuse of public and donor funds. Some of the main guests like the South African, Nigerian and Sudanese presidents arrived in Toyota Land Cruisers, which were more appropriate for the weather, the topography and the state of the road infrastructure. In fact, there was only one paved and tarmacked road from the airport to the Mausoleum. The protocol was chaotic. The hosts hadn't stationed welcoming teams like ushers for invited guests at the airport. There were no customs or immigration desks for travellers to be processed through. Getting out of the plane was a challenge as planes were taxing on the same runways that alighting and boarding passengers were using. I was pleasantly surprised that there were no fatalities during the occasion. There were no welcoming teams at the Dr. John Garang Mausoleum, either. Many foreign guests ended up siting in the harsh sun on the grass and paved sidewalks at the Mausoleum. Even former President Moi sat with us on the pavement in the hot sun. Nigerian President Jonathan and South African Jacob Zuma had to fight their way to a small place reserved for heads of states and governments upstairs in the Mausoleum. Zuma's bodyguards comically engaged Kiir's bodyguards in a bad display of pushing and shoving up the stairs as we watched. Apparently, Kiir's bodyguards felt that that only Kiir and his cabinet should have been permitted to sit upstairs at a place reserved for the VIP. Many feared that a fire fight could breakout. There were no printed programs. When the sun became unbearable and many of us were nearly dying of dehydration, some South Sudanese wearing ""VIP Usher Badges"" started distributing bottled water. However, to our utter amazement - and contrary to our expectations of African hospitality - the bottled water was only given to fellow South Sudanese. Invited guests tried to catch their eyes to no avail. There was a huge white tent behind the Mausoleum, which was reserved for VIP lunch after the event. Surprisingly, the place was being run by the Ethiopian wife of a South Sudanese cabinet minister. All the waiters, cooks and servers inside that tent were Ethiopian. When we inquired why, we were shocked to learn, from a South Sudanese, that South Sudanese don't like working. I took that to mean that they prefer to do white collar jobs. Ironically, most South Sudanese don't possess academic qualifications and experience that can make them useful in the available 'white collar jobs.' In any event, a country must have people participating in all the required endeavours. There must be those engaged in agricultural production, factory workers, teachers, cleaners, nurses, technicians and physicians, et cetera. A country must have construction workers, drivers and toilet cleaners as much as it also needs professors and other professionals. But what astounded me most profoundly, apart from the protocol chaos and the absence of even a small stadium for the occasion, were three things. First, there were no acknowledgements, even from President Salvar Kiir, of regional leaders like Moi who had played pivotal roles in their independence. No mentions and no opportunity to address the gathering. A leadership that could suffer such amnesiac attack at independence couldn't remember its promises to its own people, I remember thinking that day. Second, apart from a cursory mention of Dr. John Garang de Mabior, the SPLM/SPLA leader from 1983 to 2005, the new South Sudan leadership had all but forgotten him completely. Even though the most solemn and significant event was being held at his mausoleum, no South Sudanese leader of note paid tribute to him. His widow, Rebecca Garang, who was seated with other heads of government upstairs, was barely mentioned, too, even though at the time, she held the lofty but meaningless title of ""Advisor to the President of South Sudan."" Thirdly, when Kiir stood up and read what he said was the complete text of the South Sudan draft Constitution, there was no mention of the term limit for the president; no mention of when democratic elections would held; no outline of any values and vision for the new country; and clearly nothing said about a roadmap towards the ratification of the country's permanent constitution. It was as if we were attending a coronation of a President for Life! I remember mentioning to members of our delegation on our way back that the event was a huge disappointment. I could detect the new leadership's main agenda was consolidation of power and self-enrichment. And now, as we mourn the cascading and spiralling of the evolving political crisis, we must demand a few things of the regional and international leaders who are currently intervening. First, those involved in trying to resolve the crisis must remember that only neutral and professional mediation will succeed. Partisan meddling and power games will not do. For a mediation exercise to be both credible and legitimate, it must be conducted transparently by a neutral without any bias or interest in the outcome. A mediation exercise that starts by prescribing outcomes or taking sides in what is clearly an internal political power struggle within the SPLM/SPLA can never be considered legitimate. Second, it is imperative that the South Sudanese government creates an environment that allows free, fair and democratic competition and elections within the SPLM/SPLA and the country at large. Everyone should be allowed to participate. Free, fair, transparent elections premised on secret ballot must be the basis of choosing leaders; not tribal considerations. We must encourage the South Sudanese to choose leaders based on their tested record, competence and integrity; not tribal loyalties. Third, the South Sudan government needs to initiate and conclude a process that will quickly result in the enactment of a new, democratic constitution with term limits on its presidents and checks and balances on its institutions of governance. Without these, South Sudan will break down into a civil war and the long suffering people will never realise their independence dreams. We cannot allow that to happen!

He recalls how he and his colleagues in the task force writing the Economic Recovery Strategy (ERS). The focus was going to be employment and wealth creation rather than what he calls 'poverty business' - something that he accuses the Moi government of: 'We strongly advised Narc against going in for a big aid funded programme too early, as these had the habit of unraveling and destabilizing the budget and the economy. We argued that a ""governance dividend"" of reducing corruption, inefficiency and wastage would be sufficient to finance the recovery.' But then, he notes, the government quickly caved in and pursued aid financing (aid is nice: go to Washington/London/Paris/Berlin and collect millions. Less work than fixing local revenue collection - although, admittedly, Kenya was probably a bit more successful at that than some of the neighbouring governments). Donors committed significant funding, encouraged by Kenya's supposedly fresh political start and the NARC government's reassurances that corruption would no longer be a way of life. In the end, the excitement over massive aid promises was short lived: AngloLeasing hit the headlines and dampened donor enthusiasm. Then, following the referendum, Mr Kibaki threw out the progressives, Ndii says, and the GoK reverted to a 'complete triumph of capital fundamentalism, in the name of Vision 2030: growth above all else, fuelled by mega infrastructure projects.' Good times for corporate profits, but the poor were hit by rising prices: During the first Kibaki administration, the low income group's cost of living rose by 70 per cent, in contrast to 40 per cent for the higher income groups. Ndii argues that the government should have invested in productive capacity rather than the large infrastructure projects. I don't entirely agree with his conclusions: For starters, it's difficult to grow investments in productive capacity if you don't have the infrastructure to bring products to markets. never mind that it's an illusion that Kibaki's tenure was so very successful in terms of infrastructure development. Yes, if you come from a potholed, single lane, then Thika Highway is fantastic. But it's not a super highway, just a biggish road and really not that long either. If anything, Kenya needs more, not less of it. Regarding the creation of productive capacity, he also places a lot of emphasis on agriculture: not surprising, since it's one of Kenya's largest contributors to the economy, has serious backward and forward linkages in the economy, and creates an economy for the vast majority of Kenyans. But again: growing the sector, making it more productive, is of course important. But at the same time, this can't be an either-or: Kenya should most certainly strive to expand into other sectors as well. I think the point that Ndii made earlier, the governance dividend of reducing corruption, inefficiency and wastage, is one that he does not spend enough attention on. Corruption bloats infrastructure spending while leading to substandard results. Corruption also means that any efforts by government to create more productive capacities would be of limited use, and waste a lot of money. Government involvement and ownership needn't necessary be bad, former KCB CEO Terry Davidson reminded me: but KCB's turnaround was made possible because government no longer meddled. Ndii rightfully highlights that the gains from the growth of the past years have been unevenly distributed: Corruption reduces funding available for the most vulnerable citizens, and ruins the quality of those limited services provided for them. With a technically competent and minimally corrupt government, almost anything would be possible - because Kenya has so much going for it. Not so with 'our turn to eat' business as usual. And I kinda doubt the commitment to meritocracy and technical capacity of anyone who appoints a stone-throwing politician to a parastatal. Or anything else."514,The Star,1/14/2014,Judicial Officers Will Carry Their Corruption Cross - CJ,,KENYA (94%); UNITED STATES (79%),,Newspaper,Peter Ng'etich,ENGLISH,"MASSACHUSETTS, USA (79%)",14-Jan-14,"NAIROBI, KENYA (90%); BOSTON, MA, USA (79%)",290 words,CORRUPTION (90%); LAW SCHOOLS (86%); CRIMINAL LAW (76%); SUPREME COURTS (73%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (73%); APPOINTMENTS (73%); GRADUATE & PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS (69%) Kenya; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"CHIEF Justice Willy Mutunga yesterday said judicial officers will carry their corruption cross. Mutunga said every cent in judiciary must be accounted for since it is in the pivotal position that fights the vice. ""Corruption must be stopped by all judicial officers. Every cent that has been budgeted for must be accounted for,"" he said. The CJ was speaking at the Supreme Court in Nairobi after swearing in the new Chief Registrar of Judiciary Ann Atieno. The CJ said he envisions a corrupt-free judiciary, which Atieno must always uphold. Atieno takes over from Gladys Shollei who was sacked last year by the Judicial Service Commission on claims of corruption. Mutunga said that on October 28 last year, JSC launched a search for a new chief registrar and the official search ended on January 11. He said on conclusion, JSC unanimously appointed Atieno as the new CRJ. Mutunga said judiciary is an institution that must become a beacon for justice, incorruptibility and independence. He said the judiciary should not be used by any politician as their market place. Mutunga told Atieno that the office of the CRJ is not for private gain and she should ensure that judiciary clients are served properly. ""It's an office of service, not patronage. It should never be ethnicised or enslaved by any forces in our society,"" he said. Atieno said she is aware of the challenges her office has had since mid last year. ""But I am confident that I will instil professionalism in the judiciary,"" she said. Atieno has a bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Nairobi and a post graduate diploma in legal practice from the Kenya School of Law. She has a Masters in Criminal Justice from Boston University, USA. Atieno has practiced law for 24 years."515,The Star,1/17/2014,Mandago Sends Home 5 Officers Over Corruption,,KENYA (79%),,Newspaper,Mathews Ndanyi,ENGLISH,,17-Jan-14,,260 words,CORRUPTION (95%); ETHICS (90%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (90%); COUNTIES (90%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%) Kenya; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Governance,"Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago has interdicted five senior county officers over corruption allegations. Mandago said those interdicted were found tampering with records for land rates owed to the county government by land owners. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has rated the county as leading in corruption. Mandago said he will take stern measures on employees and members of the public involved in graft. ""We are doing an audit to find out what has been altered in the records and all the officers involved will have to go home,"" he said at his office in Eldoret town yesterday. The governor said some of the officers had been cutting deals to reduce official figures of land rates owed to the county. In some cases, land owners who owe the county Sh200,000 were indicated to owe Sh20,000 after the records were altered. ""We are telling the residents that if you want to negotiate with the county government over rates, it's proper to come directly then we agree on how you can pay in installments,"" Mandago said. He said he is not ready to have his county rated as the worst in corruption again. ""We are saying no to corruption and that is the position we will take everywhere and in all our offices,"" Mandago said. He invited the EACC to help him put in place systems that will help the county to tackle graft. The EACC will also train officers and help to implement an anti-corruption policy and strategy. Those intredicted have been asked to explain why they should not be fired. The county is owed more than Sh5 billion by land rates defaulters."516,The Star,1/21/2014,Anti-Gay Laws Will Heighten Corruption in Africa,,AFRICA (95%); KENYA (93%); SWEDEN (92%) Africa,,Newspaper,Calestous Juma,ENGLISH,,21-Jan-14,"NAIROBI, KENYA (79%)",479 words,GAYS & LESBIANS (91%); CORRUPTION (90%); DISCRIMINATION (89%); GENDER EQUALITY (77%); GLOBALIZATION (77%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (77%); BRIBERY (76%); ADMISSIONS & CONFESSIONS (72%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (71%); HOTELS & MOTELS (68%); TAXICABS & LIMOUSINES (63%); NOBEL PRIZES (56%); PROSTITUTION (50%) Kenya; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"The spread and strengthening of anti-gay laws in Africa (now covering 39 out of 54 countries on the continent) is to threat everyone's human rights irrespective of their sexual orientation. Because of the public stigma attached to being gay, the laws can be used to extract false confessions and bribes. This happened to me in Kenya in the early 1980s. My organization, Environment Liaison Centre International--then chaired by the late Nobel laureate Wangari Maathai--hosted the founder of a small start-up NGO in Sweden called Ekoteket. He had hosted me on my visit to Sweden. On his last day I offered to buy his dinner and show him around in Nairobi prior to his late flight. On the way to his hotel around 8:30pm to pick up his luggage to go to the airport we were stopped by two policemen. We were asked for our IDs which we proudly produced. I explained who we were and the purpose of our guest's visit. After inspecting our documents, one of the officers pulled me aside and said if we didn't give them some money they would arrest us and we would be charged for breaking the law on homosexuality. Suddenly it dawned on me that I could not prove that I was not a male prostitute. Where there is stigma a charge is the punishment, no further proof is needed to inflict injury. I was stunned by the claim and the humiliation of having to say this to our guest. I tried again to explain, including the fact our guest had used up all his local currency and all he had left was money for his taxi. I only had money for my taxi home that evening. I ended giving up my taxi fare and a little more from my guest. We had to show the policemen all the money we had. My worst memory of the encounter was being forced by the policemen to shake hands saying we gave them the money in good faith. When I recounted to Wangari Maathai this experience she related it to her own ordeals and the abuse of laws that discriminate against women. For her this was yet another example of the dangers of discriminatory practices and why people needed to oppose them even if they didn't think they affected them directly. The spread of anti-gay laws is a threat to every African irrespective of his or her sexual orientation. They broaden the foundation for corruption and encourage the trampling of liberties. Africa's better days lie with a more tolerant future, not a past world that seeks to have a stranglehold on society by globalizing hate and entrenching it in national legislation. My conscience and personal experience advise against silence. This is because in the hands of determined corrupt officials I cannot prove that I am not gay. This in itself is a test no one should be subjected to in a society that cherishes human liberty.
