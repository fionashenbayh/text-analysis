Chairman Kassim Riga, secretary Victoria Tumaini and commissioner Salim Mrina appeared before labour committee led by Swalehe Simba. Riga requested to be heard in camera as he responded to corruption allegations levelled against the board. He said the matter was very sensitive to be heard in public. Ndavaya ward representative Juma Masoud told the sitting that some people had allegedly informed him that one had to bribe the commissioners to get any job. ""Is it true that no one can get a job in Kwale before he or she bribes you? Is it true that in the suspended recruitment of ECD teachers, about three people claimed they were asked to pay Sh100,000 to be picked ,"" Masoud said. Riga said he is willing to tell the committee everything. He said he was personally approached by one of the county leaders to give his relative a job in exchange of a beach plot. Riga told the committee he told off the leader, who he refused to name, before journalists were sent out. Sources who refused to be named told the Star that the leader is one of the MCAs. Simba said he will not discuss the issue currently until they table a report before the assembly for discussion."518,The Star,2/1/2014,President Uhuru and DP Ruto Will Not Eliminate Corruption,,KENYA (96%); ETHIOPIA (92%); PHILIPPINES (79%),,,Newspaper,Koigi Wamwere,ENGLISH,899 words,,3-Feb-14,,CORRUPTION (91%); RAILROAD CONSTRUCTION (90%); MASS TRANSIT CONSTRUCTION (90%); POLITICS (79%); CARTELS (76%); ETHNICITY (60%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (56%) Kenya; Corruption; Construction; Industry and Infrastructure,"President Uhuru and DP Ruto have announced they will proceed with the multibillion railway project from Mombasa to Malaba and those who don't like it can go and hang. Kenyans have however raised a red flag over the railway project citing irregularities that include; different figures for the cost of the project from different ministries, overpricing of the project compared to the same job done for Ethiopia and most shocking, giving contract to a company that is blacklisted by World Bank over improprieties in the Philippines. Don't we fear hunting with ogres or are we ogres too? While denying any possibility of corruption in the railway contract, President Uhuru and DP Ruto have claimed that those who are complaining against the project are holding brief for corrupt cartels in the government who were inherited from the Kibaki regime but no one is sacking them! If some leaders agree there are cartels in government seeking contracts for themselves, local and Chinese contractors, nothing should proceed before the air is cleared. But although Uhuru and Ruto deny any corruption in these deals, people have a right to be apprehensive when different leaders in the same government claim graft about the same contracts. When accusations of corruption are made, poor Kenyans must feel uncomfortable when they remember grabbing of land by Kenyatta government, Ken Ren and Goldenberg of Moi era, Anglo-leasing, Triton, loss of free education and Aids money under Kibaki and now Railway, Lapsset, Laptop and Tassia Estate of NSSF under Uhuru and Ruto. Is not, once bitten twice shy? But if overpricing of projects is not denied by Uhuru and Ruto and if the railway project goes on, it is Kenyan taxpayers who will shoulder the bill for many years. This is why Kenyans get poorer while the corrupt get richer. When corruption was exposed during Kenyatta and Moi eras, the exposures were ignored and their authors killed or detained without charge or trial. When corruption was exposed under Kibaki, it was taken as legitimate and those raising the alarms were dismissed as doomsayers, liars or the never-do-wells and Kenyans continue to pay for it. Likewise, Uhuru and Ruto have said in very forceful language that suspect projects will go on whatever anybody says. And fortunately for them, ethnic leaders have their Chinese terra-cotta warriors who will go to the grave with them, not for their innocence but shared ethnicity. The Kikuyu even say however earned, cattle in Kikuyu land are better than those in Maasai land while pastoral communities say, all cattle belong to them. How then can leadership extirpate corruption when communities justify and defend it? Kenyan leaders will not give up corruption if they benefit from it and know Kenyans support it even when they are its victims. Leaders believe political life is a gamble and the bigger the gamble, the greater the gain. To political high-stake players, a gamble of Sh400 billion is irresistible however baffling and risky. Indeed, mega corruption is the goose that lays the golden eggs and only a foolish leader will commit suicide by killing it. President Uhuru has asked people who are dissatisfied with the railway project to go to him or parliamentary committees for remedy. But how can leaders arbitrate against corruption when MPs, senators, MCAs, President and his deputy avoided vetting by shoving aside chapter six of the constitution? What corruption is President Uhuru fighting with his website when he is not fighting alleged graft in the major projects of Jubilee government? When I was in Parliament and government, I learnt Kenya is a society whose 95 per cent lies in the dark, underground of corruption and only five per cent of it is above the surface, transparent, honest and untainted by graft. From their refusal to implement annual reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General, reports of Parliamentary Accounts Committee and Parliamentary Investments Committee, Kenyan governments from colonialism to Uhuru's have never fought and will not fight corruption. In Kenya, a crusader against corruption is an enemy of government that is always a friend of graft. When I was elected chairman of PAC in April 1981, President Moi threatened to dissolve the committee if I did not resign. Corrupt civil servants protested that as chair of PAC, I would use the committee to witch-hunt them. When I refused to resign, they forced compliant members to vote me out in order to ""save"" the committee. Have we learnt nothing since 1981, if Uhuru and Ruto government can claim the railway deal is clean and beneficial to Kenya, claim it wants to fight corruption but give a multi-billion contract to a Chinese company that is blacklisted by the World Bank. Has Kenya not been impoverished by fake contracts with conmen-contractors because we failed to undertake due diligence on them? Is the appetite and greed of individuals to earn billions enough to mortgage the survival of the nation and entire future of our children and their children? How can Ruto and Uhuru claim Jubilee government is for development, but allow foreign contractors to overprice projects by hundreds of billions? With what shall we finance our future development if we allow corruption to bankrupt us today? To end corruption, Kenyans must stop defending graft by their ethnic elites, unite and use all the forums available to expose, rebuke, attack and kill corruption."519,The Star,2/1/2014,ICT Board Cautioned On Corruption Temptations,,KENYA (94%),,,Newspaper,Constant Munda,ENGLISH,409 words,,3-Feb-14,"NAIROBI, KENYA (72%)",CORRUPTION (90%); APPOINTMENTS (90%); ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT (77%); COMPUTING & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (74%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (73%); APPROVALS (73%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (73%); EXECUTIVES (69%); PURCHASING & PROCUREMENT (57%) Kenya; Corruption; ICT and Telecom,"ICT Secretary Fred Matiang'i has warned the nine-member ICT Authority board to be wary of corruption temptations that could come through multi-billion deals in fatty government tenders under their watch. The ICT authority is mandated to approve procurement processes of the capital intensive ICT projects including delayed Sh1.2 trillion Konza Technology City. ""You come in at a very challenging time when government is investing heavily in ICT, "" Matiang'i said on Thursday when he inaugurated the board in Nairobi. ""Public interest must come first because there is going to be serious investment now and in future."" However, the appointment of six directors by the CS on January 16 has sparked off sharp protests from ICT Association of Kenya over the procedure used and heavy public sector presence. ICTAK charged that the CS contravened legal notice 183 of 2013 in appointing some of the directors from public universities and their concurrent appointment when the law stipulates they be appointed at different times to avoid vacuum when their respective terms expires. ""We are not out to sabotage anybody but the procedure should be followed,"" said ICTAK secretary general Kamotho Njenga. ""The ministry already has a number of court cases that has slowed implementation of critical projects and the CS should revoke the gazette notice to avoid further suits. "" The contested appointees from public universities are Timothy Waema and Elijah Omwenga both of University of Nairobi and Esther Kibere of Kenyatta University. Matiang'i however dismissed ICTAK protest as ""petty"" from ""idle"" people saying he went for some of the best brains. ""This was deliberate because we want to take standards higher,"" he said. ""They have engaged in...research for many years and they will come up with seamless policies. "" Other appointed members are Bertha Dena of Unites States International University, David Mugo and Ugas Mohamed from the private sector. They will be joined on the board, chaired by last month's presidential appointee Edwin Yinda, by representatives of Principal Secretaries in ministries of ICT,Treasury and Lands. The authority in August 2013 assumed duties previously discharged through Kenya ICT Board, Department of e-Government and the Government Information Technology Services then under Treasury. Matiang'i however remained non-committal on when he will appoint the chief executive of the authority saying it will be done procedurally and in due course."520,The Star,2/6/2014,Mandago Seeks Help to Fight Corruption,,KENYA (79%),,,Newspaper,Mathews Ndanyi,ENGLISH,107 words,,10-Feb-14,,CORRUPTION (94%); COUNTIES (92%); ETHICS (90%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (90%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%) Kenya; Corruption,UASIN GISHU Governor Jackson Mandago has invited the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to help unearth graft allegations in the county government.

""I wish to make it clear that the commission will not succumb to any form of pressure, propaganda, coercion, blackmail, intimidation or undue influence from any person."" The issue at hand, the Star established, is claims that the commission is preparing the ground for re-opening of the controversial Charterhouse Bank. A section of media reported that Matemu was under pressure from directors of the bank to clear it and has been meeting them. They quoted a letter allegedly written by an official of the bank demanding public release of a report of an investigation carried out by the defunct Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission on its operations several years ago. The bank was closed and placed under statutory management seven years ago on accusations of money laundering, tax evasion and economic sabotage.

Even as Kenyans were digesting Mr. Kimemia?s words, thepolice violently moved to brutally break up a peaceful protest rally led by prominent good governance activist Boniface Mwangi, intotal disregard of the constitutional provision protecting citizens? rights to peaceful demonstrations. On the 13th of February, the National Security Advisory Committee (NSAC) issued a statement signed off by the Secretary to the Cabinet, Francis Kimemia. Reading it, it is impossible not to have a sense of dí©jíæ-vu. The substance of the statement - that a foreign government is funding organizations to destabilize the Kenya government - is not new. In actual fact this is a familiar Moi-era narrative, the timing of whose re-emergence can only be described as anachronistic. That is, of course, unless this echo of a bygone era is a diversionary tactic, intended to distract Kenyans from much more pressing matters. In a country where we are living in a clearly deteriorating security situation, it is deeply troubling that the NSAC would have found the time to be seized with, and opine publicly to, such distracting falsehoods. Troubling because all this is happening while the truth behind Westgate saga remains unresolved, questions still linger about the death of Senator Mutula Kilonzo, and 'collapsing billboards' 'exploding light bulbs' starkly demonstrate the security challenges we face. Add to this what seems to be a serious crackdown on supposed Muslim extremist elements at the Coast that could serve to further alienate a youthful, angry and hungry demographic there. Additionally, we have witnessed violence that has caused the displacement of over 50,000 Kenyans from Moyale in Marsabit County. Tensions in Tana River, Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, Bungoma, Busia, and Trans Nzoia and in the border zone of the Kalenjin and Luo communities testify to this insurgent narrative. In the midst of all this the NSAC, in an uncharacteristic statement, choose to opine on their fear of 'demonstrations' by 'activists'. Not only was the content of the statement somewhat alarming, so too was the context. Even as Kenyans were digesting Mr. Kimemia's words, the police violently moved to brutally break up a peaceful protest rally led by prominent good governance activist Boniface Mwangi, in total disregard of the constitutional provision protecting citizens' rights to peaceful demonstrations. Someone, somewhere, has their priorities upside down. Those who joined Mr. Mwangi in person or spirit were motivated by issues that all Kenyans are currently complaining about - unemployment, the high cost of living, insecurity and corruption. In recent weeks the head of state has lashed out angrily against corruption with more vigour than ever before. The rhetoric against corruption has developed a consistency that is interesting, with the President even admitting that some of the worst offenders where corruption is concerned work in his own ministry. This frankness has been most intriguing; his frustration that corruption networks threaten the efficient roll out of his government's ambitious infrastructure programme has been very evident. It is timed well because while most Kenyans complain about graft, there is a sense of fatalism as to whether the government will do anything about it. Polls conducted both within and outside the country have been consistent in demonstrating that the country has slid backwards where corruption is concerned. The massive infrastructure projects the government has embarked on have ran up against the most formidable enablers of corruption in Kenya - the giant embedded networks of graft that have had 50 years to consolidate their grip on our State. Combined, they are more powerful than the institution of the head of state. The insidious nature of these networks around the world cannot be exaggerated. Embedded corruption networks consist of four groups of players, beginning with the private sector (especially brokers whose currency is access to power), and key operatives in the banking and legal fraternities. Second, the networks always include politicians who ironically are the most dispensable of the four groups of players. Elections can be held, key political godfathers of particular deals replaced, but the deals don't die, political careers, reputations and ambitions do instead. Third, the resilient core of any powerful corruption network is the bureaucracy. Here I speak not of the permanent secretary, but those lower down the ladder who shuffle contract documents from office to office. Finally, no embedded network succeeds without the protection of security sector - police and intelligence. In some countries, for example, a couple in West Africa, the drug trade is overseen by the military. Embedded graft networks make even the most well-meaning goals of an administration extremely challenging to achieve within the time allocated and at a cost that doesn't drive the poor deeper into penury. They also poison key governance institutions such as the Security Services, Judiciary and Legislature. In an increasingly globalized world, the architecture of ripping off the poor in turn uses the same networks. So money launderers (in 2010 over US$3 billion in illicit flows passed through Kenya), corrupt officials and their partners, drug traffickers, digital era slavers who trade in people (especially girls who are now a more profitable 'commodity' for organized crime than heroin), and those who are involved in the financing of terrorism increasingly in turn also use the same networks. On the anti-corruption front, Kenya is stuck in a rut. Dealing with the powerful networks that thrive here means that that in the first instance you can't simply shut them down. One starts by destabilizing and disorganizing them via all the tools available to an Executive in its arsenal. A massive variety of technical tools exist - from procurement rules to the use of digital technology to monitor, measure and analyse graft in an actionable manner. All this presumes the Executive has the will to do this - President first. They can then be dismantled and measures put in place to limit their chances of their reconstitution. The push for major prosecutions is important but prosecution is the bluntest instrument in the fight against corruption. Indeed, all over the world the corrupt love going to Court because their lawyers are better paid; legal prosecution buys them time and allows them to probe for weaknesses in the institutions of law that can be exploited. Secondly, and ironically, one can't always fight corruption successfully using outlier bespoke institutions that came into vogue in the 1990s, such as anti-corruption commissions. These were created because of the failure of institutions such as the offices of the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute corruption, and of the Police to investigate it. At the end of the day you can't deal with graft without the police on your side, hard as it is to reform that institution. In my experience, skilled cops when properly incentivized and with enough political cover are ruthlessly efficient against graft. Third, embedded networks revile transparency. All their letters, even those touching on the most mundane affairs of government in which they have an interest are always marked 'confidential' or 'secret'. Opening up government contracts and budgets to public scrutiny is essential to fight graft. As citizens make more use of our Freedom of Information provisions this should help. Fourth, a government in the grip of systemic corruption such as Kenya's is, needs to appreciate that corruption is 50 percent perception and 50 percent reality. The current controversies around the SGR, laptop and other projects bedevilling the Jubilee administration for example, has made the President and his administration a victim of the generalized cynical attitude where Kenyans do not believe that the government is serious even when the President says he wants to fight corruption. This is partly informed by history, the 'we've heard it before syndrome'. It is made exponentially worse by the kind of bizarre legitimacy-destroying statement the NSAC issued last week and the contradictory statements of different officials on the projects that are at the centre of public controversy. The management of expectations and communicating these carefully to a jaded public is key. President Uhuru has about a year left, if not less, to make significant headway in discombobulating then dismantling our embedded networks and replacing them with delivery systems and frameworks that are effective and transparent. Fifth, it helps when corruption is made a national security issue. The Chinese, for example, in their current five-year development plan, explicitly identify corruption as the biggest threat to the Communist Party's hold on power. Across Africa, too many intelligence agencies spend their time spying on the 'opposition', when it would do their countries well to invest their resources in also protecting the national piggy bank. Six, if you want to fight corruption, don't start a war with the media and civil society. What they say and do may bring discomfort, but their vigilance is essential to bolstering the Government's own efforts against graft. In Kenya's case, one of the unintended consequences of current official attempts at curbing the freedom of media and civil society to operate will be to further internationalize global activism against graft and human rights abuses in Kenya - both by institutions and individuals especially on social media. This is almost invariably accompanied with a personalization of the problem - i.e. 'the President did it' whether true or not. A reliance on propaganda via the gutter press, social media and online papers whose mission is to lie, apparently on behalf of the government or elements of it, also eventually backfires every time. The truth always emerges with the resultant deepening of public scepticism and cynicism. Last but not least, any effort to fight graft must have clear strategy for dealing with campaign finance. The proceeds of corruption often pay for increasingly expensive American-style campaigning. Those who contribute the largest sums are not donors but investors who expect a return. They become the preferential shareholders of Kenya Inc. Their demands and expectations are often inimical to the expressed ambitions of an administration vis-íæ-vis corruption generally. Finally, one recognizes that the most paralyzing corruption is the one that afflicts family and friends. And sadly, in terms of informing the public mood and defining the legacy of a leader vis-íæ-vis corruption, it is how one handles this that speaks loudest regarding the true intentions regarding corruption. The seminal 1996 Warioba Report on corruption in Tanzania argued that to succeed in the fight, one needs to literally transform it into a mass movement where all wananchi act against incidents of corruption that confront them personally and as families. This bottom-up approach began to take place in Kenya in January 2003. Across the country, citizens were arresting cops who sought bribes from them. Sadly, it fizzled out within six months, starved of the political will it needed to make it sustainable, but making evident two things. First, it is only a campaign of this nature, by the people, that can make a major demonstrable impact in the short to medium term. Secondly, for this to be sustained, the will, legitimacy and determination of the government's top leaders must be manifest."525,The Star,3/1/2014,Murder of Kenya Power Staff Linked to Corruption,,KENYA (98%),,,Newspaper,Kamore Maina,ENGLISH,545 words,,3-Mar-14,"NAIROBI, KENYA (90%)",MURDER (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); SHOOTINGS (90%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (90%); NATURAL GAS & ELECTRIC UTILITIES (89%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (89%); EXECUTIVES (89%); ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING (89%); TECHNICIANS & TECHNOLOGICAL WORKERS (89%); ENERGY CONSUMPTION (89%); INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); POLICE FORCES (78%); MANUFACTURING FACILITIES (73%); INTERNAL AUDITS (72%); APPOINTMENTS (71%); FINES & PENALTIES (62%); EXECUTIVE MOVES (54%); AUDITS (50%) Kenya; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Corruption,"TWO Kenya Power engineers murdered in the last month may have been victims of corruption in the parastatal. Yesterday Nairobi police CID commander Nicholas Kamwende said that police are investigating this possibility after the murder last Wednesday of Engineer Hannington Nyongesa Wandisi in Matasia, Ngong. Nyongesa was in charge of the Large Power section in Limuru before he was transferred to Kajiado shortly before his death. On January 23 Kenya Power engineer Francis Muchiri was shot dead in Thika. Muchiri, the KP manager in charge of Large Power in Thika region, was killed while entering his house in Ngoigua estate at around 11pm. Gunmen forced their way into his compound, shot him twice and fled. Nothing was stolen. Yesterday Thika Police Chief Paul Letin said police are yet to identify the killers. Last Wednesday Nyongesa had just arrived at a bar to watch a football match when he received a telephone call. He went outside to answer it and was shot dead as he was receiving the call. Nairobi Police commander Benson Kibue said patrons in the bar heard gunshots and found Nyongesa. The gunmen fled under the cover of darkness. Nothing was stolen from him. Nyongesa and Muchiri both worked in the Large Power department of Kenya Power which deals mainly with factories and industries. There have been rumours of illegal connections and power theft rackets saving some businesses millions of shillings per month. Yesterday Kamwende said police are also looking into possible links between the deaths of the two engineers and the alleged power theft racket. However the Kenya Power Managing Director and CEO, Dr Ben Chumo, yesterday downplayed claims that the two engineers might have been killed because of a racket between company staff and large power consumers. Unscrupulous engineers allegedly collude with large power consumers to alter power bills so that the consumer pays less than the actual power consumed, according to insider sources. The businesses allegedly pay KP employees a share of the money saved from their power bills. Chumo was appointed acting CEO of KPLC in June last year and was confirmed as the boss of Kenya Power in January. Once Chumo took over, he started a crackdown on illicit deals and slapped hefty fines on some consumers. Chumo said he did not wish to speculate on the cause of death of the two engineers as the police were investigating. He pointed out that KP stopped staff last September from reading meters of large consumers of power after installing the Automatic Meter Reading. The meters of large consumers are now read electronically from the KP head offices in Nairobi and then copied to the IT, Internal Audit and the Commercial Services departments. Chumo did not reveal how much KP might have lost before the new automated systems were installed. Yesterday Chumo confirmed that some top KP managers have gone on leave but insisted that it was for internal administrative reasons and nothing to do with corruption. He said none of them have been sacked. Those on leave include Coast Regional Manager engineer Joseph Lengaki, Manager Commercial Services Rosemary Gitonga, and Engineer in charge of Pre-paid Metering Joseph Wekesa. Engineer Sammy Muita, formerly in charge of National transmission, has become a regional manager."526,The Star,3/8/2014,Corruption 'Taking Root in the Counties',,KENYA (93%); AFRICA (93%),,,Newspaper,Brian Otieno,ENGLISH,360 words,,10-Mar-14,,CORRUPTION (93%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (90%); COUNTIES (90%); LOBBYING (90%); INTERNAL AUDITS (86%); AUDITS (86%); EXECUTIVES (76%); EXTORTION (74%); COUNTERFEITING (65%) Kenya; Corruption; Governance; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Corruption has increased since devolved governments were introduced, a human rights lobby has said.

""While huge sums of tax payers' money was being lost to the then centralised system of governance, it has now become apparent that collectively, Kenyans are losing much more through the devolved system of governance,"" said Haki Africa executive director Hussein Khalid in a statement yesterday. Khalid called on governor and their finance executives to be more strict and punitive against corrupt activities and individuals. He said governors must fight corruption at all costs. ""In Mombasa county for example, Kongowea market is evidence of such a matter where cartels, most of them led by politicians are extorting money from business and denying the county the much needed revenue for development projects,"" said Khalid. He said the county loses Sh1 million from the market daily due to the cartels. Corruption allegations have been levelled against Mombasa finance executive Walid Khalid but he has since denied all of them. Walid and Kongowea ward representative Jabess Oduor have been at loggerheads with each accusing the other of propagating corruption. The executive has accused the county representative of being the leader of a cartel that operates in Kongowea market. Oduor, who has denied the allegation, has however countered saying Walid has forged documents to try and implicate him in the corrupt deals he has been undertaking in the county. Yesterday, a supposed internal audit report dated February 25 and signed by S. K. Kiragu, the interim county internal auditor, implicates Walid in a scam involving an imprest of Sh608,130 in which the executive is said to have received double payment for an official trip to Holland. The Star could not verify the authenticity of the audit report as calls to various departments and authorities either could not get through or went unanswered.

I say it has lost the battle; there are those who would say it has lost the plot. However, even a cursory reading of the Jubilee manifesto makes it clear that from the beginning it never had a plot when it came to corruption. In a world where GDP growth can often blast ahead, even in a high corruption environment, the hardnosed attitude of the administration has been: ""do what it take to get stuff done because in the end, the critical criteria in judging success will be based on the achievement of particular goals"". The assumption: a few kickbacks here or there will pale into the recesses of the collective imagination when confronted with on-the-ground realities: a gleaming new railway, a state-of-the-art port, a generation of pupils proudly carrying laptops. The Jubilee coalition's biggest promises have been about both bricks-and-mortar, and service delivery. In the past couple of months, it would seem to have become apparent to the regime that the underlying economics of these projects and Kenya's systemic corruption makes efficient delivery of all these promises at the same time - impossible. I should like to argue that a clash of cultures vis-íæ-vis the corruption inherent in the Jubilee regime has, thus far, stymied even the most pragmatic efforts to get to grips with it. Keep in mind that the current administration is more of a coalition than the last one ever was. While Raila Odinga was Prime Minister, President Kibaki's side of the coalition wielded the real power. There wasn't much Odinga could do about it but complain. The partnership between Uhuru Kenyatta (TNA) and William Ruto (URP) is a real coalition however, primarily because the union between the two principals was derived from the ICC charges they both faced going into the election. The catch however is that the two sides of the coalition are pulling in different directions. While we don't admit it openly in polite company, power in Kenya is sought primarily to eat or accumulate wealth, and/or to protect previously acquired ill-gotten wealth. Within the Jubilee coalition, a clash of cultures vis-íæ-vis 'eating' appears to be underway, if the consistency and increasing din of grumbling among the elite is to be understood in its proper context. Noticeably, there has been a more frustrated gnashing of teeth coming from the URP side of the administration than the TNA side. Some have been bold enough to call it for what it is; complaining at a perceived unfair distribution of public service positions and implicitly, the contracts that accompany these positions. The 1990s saw scandals like Goldenberg extract 10 percent of GDP in a series of transactions. When details finally emerged, it left the public dumbfounded by the sheer magnitude of what had been stolen from its coffers. Under the first President Kenyatta, graft had started out with more stealth; immediately after independence, it was specifically with regard to the dishing out of land. Under President Moi, this developed into a gigantic patronage network via which elite politics was managed. By the start of the 21st Century, several public corporations had been reduced to shells, entire forests decimated, and large swathes of state farms had been dished out to the President's cronies. This Moi-era 'let's-eat-it-all' model meant the destruction of entire institutions. There are many politicians today, in both government and opposition ranks, who cut their teeth and first made their wealth in this way. Hence the ""shock-and-awe"" scale of Goldenberg. One side of the Jubilee coalition reputedly seeks a return to these 'good old days'. This ""termites model"", devastating as it can be, is by necessity ethnically inclusive - when it rains the termites all grow wings and fly off. Every tribe's elite gets its cut. Ironically, this inclusivity makes this model far more stable politically. Under the current constitutional dispensation, making this approach work is more challenging, though it is not unlikely that devolution will see some counties exhibit its characteristics. There was a chap in the village, very much a product of the colonial period, called 'Jimmy Roger'. You could tell Jimmy Roger from a mile away. He dressed like his mzungu master: hat tipped to one side, a well-ironed shirt complete with a cravat, socks pulled neatly up to the knees, safari boots or shiny black shoes, starched khaki shorts, and a carefully trimmed thin moustache. Jimmy Roger was a happy fellow and walked with a swagger. The eating model inherited from the Kibaki regime is a sort of lassaiz-faire Jimmy Roger, perceived as the preferred modus operandi of the other side of the ruling coalition. It is corporatized, white collar, vernacular-speaking, overseas-educated, grand corruption, whose architecture is often reasonably sophisticated. Accountants, bankers and lawyers acting for 'consortiums' using a variety of financial vehicles design it. It is dependent on a powerful amalgamation of nepotism, taking conflict of interest so far to the edge of normal business practice, that it sometimes falls off. This narrative was given its policy underpinnings by the Ndegwa Commission Report of 1973 that allowed civil servants to go into business. Intrinsically, this model (dependent as it is on nepotism and conflict of interest), is necessarily exclusivist ethnically. It is therefore politically poisonous and unsustainable on the national front without generous use of the security services to manage the fallout. The Jubilee administration has settled into a model of graft that is neither of the two models and both at the same time. However, it is 50 years since independence and we are governed by a new constitution that is accompanied by more confident, urgent and impatient demands for accountability from wananchi more cognisant of citizen responsibilities. This, in part, explains what can be described as a comedy of gaffes and faux pas on the part of regime spokesmen answering questions on some of the current government's flagship projects. Secondly, as far as huge, officially sanctioned scams go, a pattern has emerged in Kenya averaging roughly one, at most two, every decade. Currently however, the media seems to uncover a new scam practically every month. And others become scams because of the inexperience, bungling and miscommunication on the part of senior officials. The multiplicity of grand policy and economic misadventures on the part of the regime is complicated by the transition to a new constitutional dispensation. The consequences have already started to manifest in political volatility, elite fragmentation and social disorganisation as we try and wrap our minds around it all. But perhaps the most unsettling current consequence is the meltdown underway on the security front around the nation. Cities like Nairobi, Kisumu, and Mombasa have been especially hard hit. Members of the middle class, for the first time sensing themselves as sustained targets of the types of crime the poor long ago became accustomed to, are disheveled but keeping a stiff upper lip. To admit it too wholeheartedly would be to accept that in the short term, it will get considerably worse..."529,The Star,3/20/2014,"Corruption in State House Won't Be Tolerated, Says Lenku",,KENYA (93%),,,Newspaper,Kamore Maina,ENGLISH,168 words,,20-Mar-14,"NAIROBI, KENYA (90%)",CORRUPTION (95%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (88%); CARTELS (70%); IMMIGRATION (52%) Kenya; Corruption; Governance,"Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph ole Lenku yesterday warned that corruption will not be tolerated at the Office of the President.

In an interview in Lusaka yesterday, Local Government and Housing Minister Brian Chituwo said PF president Michael Sata had been accusing the Government of being corrupt but had not issued a statement to condemn his councillors and MPs. Dr Chituwo said Zambians must judge which of the two parties was corrupt following allegations that MPs who had been named in the PF shadow cabinet were named as beneficiaries of the 102 plots that were irregularly shared. The minister said the on-going investigations at the country's biggest council had revealed deep scandals apart from the Lilayi Housing project. Dr Chituwo said the team had continued receiving submissions from the members of the public on many other irregularities that were unknown, which forced him to extend the suspension from the initial 90 days for another three months. He said the Government had faced a lot of accusations that it was corrupt but the PF had failed to provide evidence for the law-enforcement officers to investigate. Dr Chituwo said the Government had operated in an open and transparent manner, which had helped raise more resources for the construction of roads and hospitals countrywide. He said avoiding corruption at 100 per cent was impossible in any government but its commitment had been shown with the enactment of new laws such as the Whistle Blowers Act and strengthening of the anti-money laundering systems. The minister urged residents to continue providing reports on what they knew about corruption at the LCC in order to improve service provision for the local government to operate efficiently. Dr Chituwo, who is MMD chairperson for local government, said people were quick at condemning the Government on the basis of the Auditor General's reports but never followed up when recoveries were made. He said the Government always ensured that people mentioned refunded the Government and where crime had been detected, such people were handed over to the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC). Dr Chituwo said the PF had been malicious against the Government and wondered what answers they had over the high levels of corruption at the council. Lusaka City Council was involved in a land scam in which councillors mayors, MPs, PF officials such as secretary general Wynter Kabimba were given plots that were not advertised in line with the law. Later reports indicated that Lusaka Mayor Daniel Chisenga sold oneplot to a resident of Lusaka. The mayor was allocated 10 plots while his deputy had five and the acting town clerk received five. Meanwhile, Dr Chituwo has said the LCC will remain suspended until the investigations that were currently going on are concluded. Dr Chituwo said some of the offences that were leveled against some officials were serious, hence the need for investigations to be allowedto be concluded. Dr Chituwo, who was speaking when he featured on Radio Phoenix's Let the people talk programe on Tuesday said the Government wanted to set up structures that would protect the council from any future abuse from office-bearers. ""How possible is it that one person can get 10 plots? We want to get to the bottom of this for now and for the future,"" Dr Chituwo said. Dr Chituwo said in the event that the investigations established that criminal activities took place within the council, the inquiry would be handed over to the law-enforcement agents for further cause of action. ""I want to tell the nation that the Government is on course but the issues are complex and require time. We have to ensure that the findings are true and fair,"" Dr Chituwo said."532,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),8/1/2011,Corruption Cases Reduce - ACC,,ZAMBIA (92%),,,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,386  words,,1-Aug-11,,CORRUPTION (96%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (90%); INTERVIEWS (90%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (78%); CUSTOMER SERVICE (70%); WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION (67%); IMMIGRATION (55%) Zambia; Corruption,"THE Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has said corruption cases have reduced due to the introduction of internal mechanisms in organisations that prevent corruption. Chief communication education officer, Festus Chipungu said in an interview at the on-going Agriculture and Commercial Show that the integrity committee had been introduced in Government organisations, agencies and private companies to monitor operations. This year's Agriculture and Commercial Show is carried under the theme, 'Shaping tomorrow's world.' Mr Chipungu said reforms such as customer service had also been set up in some organisations and had worked very well in fighting corruption in the immigration department, Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) and the Ministry of Lands. He said reforms had worked in the fight against corruption because they prevented individuals from having too much power over the clients and improved accountability and transparency. ""We have set up about 15 integrity committees in more than 15 organisations such as the Government, agencies and private companies,"" he said. He said the introduction of the Whistle-blowers Act under the Public Interest Disclosure number four of 2010 would encourage more people to report corrupt cases to the ACC. He said efforts had also been made to widely publicise the existence of the law through the electronic adverts, information materials and lectures. ""The integrity committee that started two years ago has proved to be a success in the fight against corruption in organisations,"" he said. Mr Chipungu further said ACC had engaged civil society organisations to supplement its efforts in fighting corruption through educating the public.ÂHe called on the public to take the fight against corruption seriously and treat those corrupt as thieves because the act took away resources, which was tantamount to stealing. He urged the public to take advantage of different materials published in all the seven major local languages on corruption so that they could fully understand its dangers to the economy. ""People do not fully understand the effects of corruption. It results in lack of proper housing, no enough education and diverting of resources meant for development to private purposes. About 140 corrupt cases were reported to the ACC last year and were mostly from individuals."533,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),8/8/2011,PF Adoption Marred By Corruption -- Lifwekelo,,ZAMBIA (94%); FINLAND (79%),,,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,733  words,,8-Aug-11,"LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (90%)",EXECUTIVES (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (90%); TALKS & MEETINGS (79%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (78%); POLITICS (78%); DISORDERLY CONDUCT (77%); MENTAL ILLNESS (72%); INTELLIGENCE & COGNITION (67%); HOTELS & MOTELS (50%) Zambia; Corruption,"FORUM for Leadership Search executive director Edwin Lifwekelo has said it is obvious that the adoption of candidates by the Patriotic Front (PF) is embroiled in corruption by the party leadership. Mr Lifwekelo said there were allegations that Copperbelt and Lusaka parliamentary seats were fetching as much as K100 million, adding that it was a clear indication that democracy in PF had been subverte and mutilated by Mr Sata. And Mr Lifwekelo has disclosed that his organisation has information that a meeting took lace at the Finnish Embassy where donors expressed disgust at the PF/Post alliance. He alleged that at the meeting, Post editor Fred M'membe failed to justify his alliance with the PF and the same was described by the donors as unprofessional. Mr Lifwekelo said the donors further expressed unhappiness with M'membe's willingness to turn the newspaper into a PF propaganda machinery. Meanwhile, Committee of Citizens executive director Gregory Chifire has called on relevant authorities to establish a commission of inquiry to ascertain Mr Sata's full mental capacity. Mr Chifire said it was in the interest of the nation and that of Mr Sata that an inquiry be stablished going by a number of things that Mr Sata had been doing which were not in onformity with the behaviour of a would-be republican president. He said this at a Press briefing held at Courtyard Hotel in Lusaka yesterday. Mr Chifire said his organisation had been compelled to furnish information in accordance with the provisions of the Mental Disorder Act Chapter 305 of the Laws of Zambia to relevant authorities for the possible establishment of an inquiry into the irregular conduct which was akin to mental disorderly conduct. He alleged that Mr Sata's conduct had not only been highly disorderly, irregular and sad but it seemed to suggest that his mental comprehension was not as it should be. Mr Chifire said Mr Sata's conduct could seriously be classified under the provisions and ambit of the law, in particular the Mental Disorder Act, adding that his organisation had found it fit to classify Mr Sata as an individual well within the provisions of Section 5 of the said Act, in particular Class I and II under the Act. He said although he was not an expert in the medical profession but merely a law-abiding citizen who believed in the laws the of Zambia, he had an obligation to point out matters of nation interest such as Mr Sata's conduct that Zambians had since sadly become ccustomed to through Mr Sata's conduct. Mr Chifire said the Act clearly gives members of the public the liberty to enforce what could be termed in lay mans language as a 'citizen arrest' for purposes of ensuring that mental isorderly conduct was gagged. He said establishing of an inquiry was a safer and more dignified route that his organisation was seeking because Mr Sata had constantly displayed conduct to the general public. Mr Chifire said his organisation would rely on well-documented conduct exhibited by Mr Sata on different occasions such as the November 1, 2008 issue where Mr Sata astonished the whole nation when he allegedly went on rampage hurling insults towards international and locally accredited journalists having lost the 2008 presidential elections. Mr Chifire said the other incident was Mr Sata's alleged unwavering support for gay rights in Zambia and his unpalatable verbal rampage on August 3 this year at a meeting called by the ECZ for presidential aspirants and also the calling of a freelance journalist, Chanda Chimba II as a hyena when he was a human being. He said that the information provided in this regard was not with malice or prejudice but was advanced purely in national interest and especially to safe guard Mr Sata's personal interest and of those around him. Mr Chifire said his organisation would soon be filing an affidavit before the courts on the request for the establishment of an inquiry. But PF vice-president Guy Scott has challenged Mr Chifire to have his mental status examined before he called on Mr Sata's mental status to be examined. Mr Scott said in an interview in Lusaka yesterday that Mr Chifire should ascertain his mental ability first and see whether he was mentally fit. ""That is nonsense! He should first have his mental status examined before he requests for Mr Sata's mental status to be examined. Let him do it first and show us how it can be done,"" Dr Scott said."534,Nairobi Star (Nairobi),8/15/2011,Academics Slam MPs Sh1 Billion Tax Deal With Treasury As Corruption,,KENYA (96%),,,Newspaper,Hilton Otenyo,ENGLISH,304  words,,16-Aug-11,,CORRUPTION (92%); WAGES & SALARIES (91%); TREASURY DEPARTMENTS (90%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (90%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (87%); ACADEMIC LIBRARIES (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (78%); LIBRARIANS (78%); TEACHER UNIONS (78%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (76%); CIVIL SERVICES (75%); RECRUITMENT & HIRING (73%); APPOINTMENTS (73%); PRIME MINISTERS (69%); HOTELS & MOTELS (67%) Kenya; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE University Academic Staff Union yesterday termed a Sh1 billion deal between MPs and Treasury over their tax arrears an act of corruption. Union chairman Prof Sammy Kubasu said the MPs were scheming to have the already overburdened Kenyans pay their tax arrears through corrupt means. ""The act is another form of corruption being introduced by MPs, selfish and an act of impunity. Kenyans should not be treated as workers and MPs as queens in a bee hive,"" said Kubasu. He said that MPs were doing this to beat the formation of the salaries and remuneration commission that would be charged with setting their salaries and those of other public servants. He accused MPs of being sluggish in passing the requisite laws in Parliament to facilitate the full implementation of the new constitution so they could continue practicing impunity. Kubasu was speaking at Lurambi at the weekend during the burial of George Shibanda, a chief librarian at Masinde Muliro University, who was discovered dead in a hotel room in Kakamega town a fortnight ago. He called for thorough investigation by police to establish the real cause of death of the librarian. Treasury was reported to have struck a deal with MPs to release Sh1 billion to pay for salary arrears since August 27 last year when the new constitution was promulgated. He accused Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Uhuru Kenyatta of accepting the deal in order to endear himself to MPs whose support for his bid for presidency he wants. Kubasu asked the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission to probe the deal as it means MPs taking money from Kenyans indirectly. The UASU chairman also asked KACC to probe rampant nepotism in hiring staff at the Masinde Muliro University. He suggested that KACC should also subject those seeking to be appointed vice chancellors to vetting."535,Nairobi Star (Nairobi),8/16/2011,Cabinet Approves Bill Establishing New Anti Corruption Body,,KENYA (69%),,,Newspaper,James Kinyua,ENGLISH,71  words,,17-Aug-11,,CORRUPTION (94%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); LEGISLATION (90%); APPROVALS (90%); ETHICS (88%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (84%) Kenya; Corruption; Governance,"A new anti-corruption body to replace KACC will be formed soon following the approval by cabinet of the Independent Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission Bill 2011.

The report is written against the backdrop of massive corruption and accompanying oppression, and the resulting culture of impunity that have characterised the system of politics and government since independence. Its aim is to bring to account the perpetrators of corruption, ethnic violence, land grabbing and other violations of the law, particularly human rights-a special concern of the KHRC. The ways in which these practices violate human rights of individuals and communities is obvious: poverty, exclusion, landlessness, ethnic fights threatening human security, impossibility of getting justice in the courts against the rich and the powerful, lack of a fair prosecution system, and the perversion of justice. The KHRC has hit upon an interesting methodology to seek accountability and punishment for these violations, namely by mining existing, official reports. Despite widespread impunity, a considerable amount of evidence has been marshalled against the perpetrators by official processes, through commissions of enquiry or parliamentary committees, or other forms of investigation-these implicate the highest officials, including presidents. Based on the evidence, they should be prosecuted and their ill gotten gains recovered. That this evidence can be gathered reflects one of the several contradictions of the Kenya system. The state is thoroughly criminalised. It serves to create wealth for a handful of politicians, bureaucrats and business people; and to shelter them from the reach of the law. It performs these functions by a systematic violation of the constitution and the law. Much of the edifice for this is built on illegality. But the inconsistency of these practices with constitutional values produces a fundamental contradiction. Deeply repressed, people are driven to put pressure on the government to deal with the more outrageous transgressions of rights. For the most part the government can ignore such pressure-but not always. When it cannot, it resorts to the typical device of delay, even obfuscation-an enquiry, firmly under the control of the government. The Reports examines several of these enquiries (on ethnic clashes, so clearly promoted by politicians (Akiwumi), land grabbing (Ndungu, prematurely terminated but not before the incrimination of the highest in the land), Goldenberg (Bosire), Grand Regency (Cockar), Artur Brothers (Parliament), two enquiries on the Ouko killing, the maize inquiry and more. Most were suppressed and are still ""confidential"" but have somehow found their way into the public domain. Another contradiction then surfaces-the framework of transparency and public participation, more so in commissions of enquiry than parliamentary committees. The enquirers cannot entirely ignore the evidence, often given in public (though they can fudge a little, and expunge names of suspects like Jomo Kenyatta and Daniel Moi). The president can lock away reports of commissions under the inquiries legislation (but not legally now under the new constitution); this is a bit more difficult with parliamentary committees, but even there intimidation or money (frequently both) can ensure no key person is embarrassed. The most wonderful and terrifying example of this-showing the enormous corruption of state institution, in this case the judiciary-concerns the way in which the wealth of a senior minister was effectively laundered through a court, by curious legal principles enabling it to re-write the commission report, exonerating the minister. Reading the KHRC Report one realises what an extensive and dense network of senior officials of every state institution operates to steal from the state and the private sector, how they mutually support and shield each other from prosecutions and other punishments (by the simple expedience of co-opting the prosecutor into their pursuits), and thus wield a firm hold over the state apparatus-no separation of powers here. The enquiries produce evidence of dishonesty, arbitrariness and thefts by presidents, ministers, ex-ministers, parliamentarians (more numerous than I had suspected), senior parliamentary staff, bureaucrats (lots of permanent secretaries), police (at the highest levels), commanders of the armed forces, district and provincial administrators, diplomats, senior officials of Central and commercial banks, and other parastatals, chief justices and other senior judges, intelligence services, mayors, town clerks and their subordinates, and the children of the above (especially presidents) and their business associates. Truly mind boggling. Among the people identified by various commissions are household names, such as J and U Kenyatta, D Moi, Saitoti, Biwott, Ntimama, I Ruto, W Ruto, Pattni, Wilson Boinett, Sally Kosgey, Henry Kosgey, Michuki, Muthaura, Hussein Ali, Mary Wambui, Balala, Okemo, Sunkuli, Kulei, Mohamed Yusuf Hajj and so on. If the allegations are justified (and remember the allegations are made after thorough inquiries, often by bodies appointed by the government), none of them would be qualified to hold public office under the Constitution's rules on leadership and integrity. Yet they currently, despite internal differences, have a complete stranglehold over the state. In these circumstances political, economic and social reforms are impossible. The KHRC calls for those against whom evidence has been found to be tried. Its recommendations for legal reform have resonances with the approach and substance of the new Constitution. And yet, one year later, it is clear that we have made no real progress in the fight against corruption and impunity. Land grabbing has increased with a vengeance, and the Ministry of Lands is able to say without embarrassment that it can do nothing about the massive corruption within the ministry that facilitates the grabbing, the falsification of titles, the forgery of deeds-and the huge sums of money that are exchanged every day to lubricate the machine that we call the Ministry of Lands. The situation in other sectors is scarcely better. The police continue to extort bribes, turn a blind eye to corruption, abduct people in broad daylight, prefer to kill rather than arrest suspects, in front of terrified spectators, secure in the knowledge that they are untouchable. Drug barons walk (or more accurately, drive in huge limousines), hobnobbing with leaders of the government s and the corporate world. The government sends innocent Kenyans abroad to be tortured without accountability to the public or the courts. The tendering process is ignored or violated daily. All these and many other violations of the constitution and the law have become central to the way the state functions. The implementation of the Constitution is in the hands of those deeply opposed to its values and procedure-and they (many of whom are listed in the enquiries) have ensured through appointing their protí©gí©es to commissions and public services that the new constitution will be rendered toothless. On the first anniversary of the constitution, it is time to turn to its real guardians, the people, victims of the harsh edge of the criminalised state, for the direction and impetus for reform.

Speaking at the at the 7th Annual International Scientific Conference held at the Moi University, Prof Lumumba lamented that realisation of MDGs will remain be a pipe dream because of lack of supporting policies as well as graft. ""We must have policies that will help to empower our people economically if we are to be serious of fighting poverty"", said PLO. He gave a key note address which is being hosted by Moi University. He said only two African states, Botswana and Mauritius have tried to meet the MDGs because they had put in place proper structures and policies to help quickly meet the goals and goals they have set. Lumumba questioned the government over the rising cost of inflation and living standards which he said were now a major burden to Kenyans. He said many Kenyans were unable to get access to basic commodities and food. He accused the government of not putting in place measures that will stop increased costs of essential goods. He said traders who are middle men had taken advantage of the situation to exploit Kenyans. The move has cause stress to Kenyans. Lumumba wondered why the country had many sugar factories but still faced shortage of sugar.

MPs accused Raila of evading the request by the Speaker to make a statement yesterday on why Moses Wetang'ula was reappointed as the Foreign Affairs minister and Mwangi Thuita as Permanent Secretary before investigations into the questionable purchase of the Kenyan embassy in Japan were concluded. On Wednesday Speaker of National Assembly Kenneth Marende instructed the Prime Minister to make a statement on the Auditor-General's report tabled earlier this week. Yesterday morning Raila called Marende and they agreed that he could deliver the statement next Tuesday. The MPs yesterday also demanded that Attorney General Githu Muigai issue a legal opinion on the reinstatement of Wetang'ula and Thuita. The legislators dismissed the explanation by Transport minister and Deputy Leader of Government Business Amos Kimunya that Raila had a busy schedule as he was attending a conference on drought as well as the burial of freedom fighter Wambui Otieno. Charles Kilonzo (Yatta) claimed that government had no intention of issuing the statement arguing the two principals could not defend their action. He demanded that a legal opinion from the AG on Wetang'ula and Thuita's reappointment be issued alongside Raila's statement. He said the House needed to know if the AG did his part before Kibaki announced the reappointments. ""The executive is having a strategy to avoid giving the statement in the hope that the matter will die down,"" said Benedict Gunda, vice chairman of the Defence and Foreign Relations Committee. George Nyamweya (PNU nominated) said the reappointment was a serious issue since Parliament had voted last year that the pair remain out of office until investigations were complete. He said Raila could have delegated issuing the statement to one of his two deputy prime ministers, Uhuru Kenyatta and Musalia Mudavadi. Bonny Khalwale (Ikolomani) said the issue had started to snowball and asked if the government was aware of the January 2011 report by the Auditor General on the purchase of the embassy building. The report by Auditor General ASM Gatumbu revealed that the government incurred excess expenditure of Sh185 million in the purchase of the embassy while Sh1.35 billion of the total price of Sh1.65 billion was paid in cash, contrary to government rules on procurement. The Auditor General has recommended that all officials and individuals involved in the acquisition of the Tokyo property be held to account. Khalwale said Finance minister Uhuru has been sitting on the report instead of tabling it in Parliament thereby violating the Public Audit Act. Khalwale said the AG also prepare a legal opinion on the Grand Regency deal and the reinstatement of Amos Kimunya into government. Uhuru denied receiving the report by the Auditor General but undertook to ask Treasury officials if the report had been sent to his office. Foreign Relations Committee chairman Adan Keynan demanded that Raila also table reports from the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission, the CID, the Efficiency Monitoring Unit or any other arm of government that indicated Wetang'ula and Thuita had been cleared. ""I don't remember in the last nine months any report on the investigations touching the ministry of Foreign Affairs,"" he said. Aden Duale (Dujis) said the matter was of great importance and called on the Speaker to compel the executive to explain. Duale, who was relieved of his ministerial duties recently, accused Raila and Kibaki of protecting certain individuals. ""The people of this country are waiting for answers,"" he said. Gitobu Imanyara (Central Imenti) said that if Raila was so busy, Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka should issue the statement since he was the Leader of the Ggovernment Business in the House. Marende told the House that Raila had visited his office yesterday morning and explained that he was in a dilemma since he was required to co-chair the summit on drought. Marende directed that Raila issue the statement next Tuesday."540,Nairobi Star (Nairobi),9/20/2011,GG Links Brew Deaths to Endemic Corruption,,KENYA (79%),,,Newspaper,Wanjohi Gakio,ENGLISH,110  words,,20-Sep-11,,CORRUPTION (90%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (83%) Kenya; Corruption,"Former cabinet minister G.G Kariuki has cited corruption as the main cause of death caused by consumption of lethal alcoholic brews.

The selection panel, which is chaired by Rose Mambo, has also advertised for two other deputies as per the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2011. The Act stipulates that the new Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission shall consist of a chairperson and two other members. The new commission replaces the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission PLO Lumumba and four deputy directors ran. The deputy directors were Pravin Bowry, Wilson Shollei, Prof Jane Onsongo and Dr John Mutonyi. The five left office after Parliament passed a new law last month that demanded a fresh recruitment for the top positions to be conducted. Since their exit from office, most operations of the commission have been under the KACC Advisory Board which is chaired by Okong'o Omogeni. Lumumba's exit from office came only days after he sensationally accused Assistant Minister Cecily Mbarire and her husband Dennis Apaa of bribery attempts. The Act stipulates that a person shall be qualified for appointment as the chairperson if they meet the requirements of Chapter Six of the Constitution which deals with integrity. The candidate should also hold a degree from a university recognised in Kenya. A member of a governing body of a political party or a person who has previously been convicted of a felony, or has been removed from public office for contravening the provisions of the Constitution or any other law, is not eligible. After conducting the interviews, the panel is required to shortlist three qualified applicants for the position of chairperson and four other qualified applicants for the positions of the members and forward the names to the President. After receiving the names, The President in consultation with the Prime Minister, will be required to pick the chairperson and two members and forward the names to Parliament for approval within 14 days. Parliament will then be required to vet and endorse the names within 21 days and forward the names to the President for formal appointment through gazette notice. If Parliament rejects any nomination, the Speaker shall within three days communicate the decision to the President and request the President to submit fresh nominations."542,Nairobi Star (Nairobi),10/3/2011,Corruption Commission HR Manager Quits Job,,KENYA (91%),,,Newspaper,Maxwell Masava,ENGLISH,300  words,,3-Oct-11,,MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (94%); CORRUPTION (93%); HUMAN RESOURCES (91%); RESIGNATIONS (90%); ETHICS (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); EMPLOYEE PROMOTIONS (73%); RECRUITMENT & HIRING (73%) Kenya; Corruption,"A senior manager at the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has quit office amid claims of infighting at the institution. Human Resource Manager Amani Komora tendered his resignation notice on Thursday last week just days after reports of mismanagement at the former Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission begun filtering in the media. Komora confirmed to the Star his exit from the newly established EACC yesterday. ""I have been with the commission for the past seven years and I just felt it is time for me to move on,"" said Komora. He is rumoured to be headed back to the Kenya Revenue Organisation where he worked before joining KACC. He denied being pushed out of the commission by latest revelations of alleged corruption from within and claims of mismanagement in terms of nepotism, favoritism and sex favours when it comes to hiring and promotion of staff. ""Like any other organisation, there will always be politics but that is not why I am leaving,"" added Komora His sudden exit, according to the staff at Integrity Centre has left other senior managers in panic with fears that it might trigger more resignations. Already investigators at the commission are said to be following keenly the activities of their immediate bosses especially those in the procurement chain. Just last week, reports emerged from the anti-graft body how senior managers have been colluding to pilfer money from the institution. The reports touched on irregular rendering procedures to irregular awarding of allowances and other benefits to selected members of the Staff. Leadership crisis at the Commission started in August when Kacc was disbanded and five of its top managers sent packing. It happened after President Mwai Kibaki assented to a new law creating Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) to replace KACC."543,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),2/8/2010,Clergyman Cites Corruption in Church,,ZAMBIA (93%),,,Newspaper,Chishimba Chishimba,ENGLISH,407  words,,10-Feb-10,,RELIGION (94%); CLERGY & RELIGIOUS (91%); CORRUPTION (90%); CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY (90%) Zambia; Religion,"UNITED Church of Zambia (UCZ) Synod Bishop Mutale Mulumbwa has called for transparency in the manner members handle finances as the church should be free from underhand activities. Bishop Mulumbwa regretted that issues pertaining to church finances in some congregations were being done 'underground.' The Bishop was speaking in Ndola yesterday during a sermon at Northrise Congregation under the theme 'finding out what pleases the Lord'. He said in some instances, church treasurers and other congregation leaders did not want to make public financial positions and revenue of the church because they lacked accountability. ""There is corruption in church. Things are being done underground. There should be transparency in the way things are done,"" he said. Bishop Mulumbwa, however, expressed happiness that at Northrise Congregation, church leaders were able to outline every income and expenditure to congregants and appealed to others to do the same. ""I am happy that things here are being done transparently. The announcements about money are important. This building is beautiful because of the manner you are handling matters. I was here when it was just a plot some years back,"" he said. In an apparent reference to the need to contribute to the church, he said God had his own way of doing things and advised Christians to always establish what the Lord wanted. ""You should pay attention to what God requires us to do. Many Christians ask God to give them what they want, but they don't want to give to God what he wants,"" he said Quoting from Luke chapter 6 Verse 38, Bishop Mulumbwa said Christians should give willingly to others, so that in return they would continue to receive with the blessings of the Lord. ""God is not the beneficiary, beneficiaries are ourselves. People should learn to please God. Give and it shall be given to you. When you do what God wants, you are inspired,"" he said. He said people should not get discouraged by fellow Christians who disparage them when they contribute to the Church's development, as it is those who give in good faith that will enhance God's work. Northrise Congregation minister-in-charge, Mwape Chilombo said she was elated that the Synod Bishop found time to deliver a sermon when the congregation launched the first English service. Reverend Chilombo said the English service was introduced because the congregation had grown and some were not conversant with the vernacular language, Bemba."544,The Monitor (Kampala),5/12/2010,A Corrupt Regime Cannot Control Corruption [opinion],,UGANDA (94%),,,Newspaper,Augustine Ruzindana,ENGLISH,654  words,,12-May-10,,POLITICAL CORRUPTION (89%); BUDGETS (89%); CORRUPTION (85%); PRIMARY SCHOOLS (78%); ELECTORAL DISTRICTS (78%); EXECUTIVES (77%); CIVIL SERVICES (76%); WAGES & SALARIES (76%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION (76%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (76%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (72%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (71%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (70%); BUDGET CUTS (70%); MIDWIVES (67%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (65%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (65%) Uganda; Crime and Corruption,"The factory of districts and electoral constituencies is the busiest enterprise in Uganda. For every district created, the following offices are also created: LC5 chair and his/her executive, a speaker and deputy of the district council, a chief administrative officer, his/her deputies/assistants and other support staff such as accountants, personnel officers, district education officer, district agricultural officer, health officer etc. Then there is the RDC, deputies and assistants, the DISO and assistants, and the DPC. Eventually a district court, prison and prosecutors will also come. Each district will have a woman MP, so that there will be five women MPs instead of one for Bushenyi. In addition to new districts, new constituencies are also being created. For example, the constituencies in Kibaale District are being sub-divided to cater for the presidential ring-fencing policy announced sometime back. Other constituencies are tailored to individual interests. This fast-tracking of the creation of districts and constituencies is for political purposes, it has nothing to do with service delivery. The life presidency project, the number one regime priority, is increasingly untenable, and therefore to sustain it, no expenditure will be spared where there is political capital. As if to prove this point, the budget for health, education, roads and other services connected to poverty reduction and the welfare of the people are drastically being reduced in the next budget in order to cater for this increased administration expenditure, which is more vital for regime survival. Education is being reduced by over Shs70 billion, which is the amount that could increase the remuneration of all primary school teachers to Shs400,000 per month. The health budget is being reduced meaning that medical personnel will get no substantial increment. How can doctors, nurses, midwives get paid peanuts and then you turn round and complain that they are not attending to patients? How can you pay the police what is not equivalent to one night allowance of the people they guard and then you condemn them in corruption surveys that they are considered the most corrupt by the public? Go to the Ministry of Lands and ask what they are paid and you will know why there are so many titles for the same piece of land. In all government, poor service is linked to poor terms of service. All government offices are virtually computerised but what value is a modern office to the official if his/her take home pay does not uplift the welfare of his/her family? Thus the public officials have taken matters in their own hands. As political corruption has risen, so has bureaucratic corruption. As of now , the biggest investors in the country, especially in real estate, land and services, are public officials, politicians, civil servants and their cronies/agents. I have read pleas to government by donors and members of the public that something should be done to control corruption. A regime that survives on corruption, a kleptocracy, cannot do something about corruption. Corruption is embedded in every government transaction at central and local levels. Museveni demands explanation on high cost of road construction (See Daily Monitor of May 10). Then he provides an answer himself ""I cannot rule out corruption as an overriding factor"" and then he provides the remedial action by instructing the Auditor General ""to provide value for money audits in the sector"". But why in the road sector alone as if there is any sector where the public gets value for money? Has there been any value for money audit for presidential donations of land and public funds to business supporters? The presidential ""pledges hit Shs4 trillion"" announces New Vision of May 10. The public purse has been turned into a political slush fund. That is the root of the problem.

We have already had a reduction in the health budget for this year by sh1b, HIV funding from donors has reduced or at least failed to keep pace with demand and donors are critical of the Government's handling of the CHOGM funds. With the financial sector meltdown last year, foreign governments are also being squeezed, since they have large national debts to finance. One trait which I have noticed in Uganda is that we shine the spotlight our own problems, we are not afraid to wash our dirty linen in public - in the most recent case it has been the misuse of CHOGM funds. But having broadcast our failings to the world, we then make little effort to remedy them. We make a song and dance in a forum such as the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee and produce a lengthy report. The President then weighs in, stating that he is taking a strong line against any official found guilty and then what happens? Nothing. In Uganda no-one should complain about the freedom of the press; the press gives wide coverage to our scandals and inquiries and everything is out there in the public domain. Nor can we complain about the independence of Parliament. Some of the committees are definitely not pro-government and certain Members of Parliament will go out of their way to expose government politicians. The Police will investigate evidence after their usual fashion and there are various offices such as the IGG and the DPP which are there to follow up these inquiries with prosecution. But despite these good offices and after numerous inquiries over many years, only a small minority of people have ever been prosecuted. So is it a national characteristic that we say one thing - usually very loudly and publicly and then do another? We talk about corruption, we hold inquiries, we name people in the newspapers, we suspend government officials, we send files to the Police or the DPP and then sit back and wait for the next cycle of inquiries and scandals. From memory, I can think of numerous scandals and inquiries over the years - the army helicopter scandal and subsequent inquiry, the URA inquiry, the Congo inquiry, the NSSF Nsimbe Estate inquiry, the Temangalo saga, the Global Fund, the GAVI fund and now CHOGM. I don't know the average, but every year we have one or two different scandals or inquiries to keep us going. Unfortunately, while the donors are happy with the freedom of the press and the information that comes out, they are beginning to realise that we are immunising ourselves against any real consequences of this rampant corruption. The theory of immunisation is that you get a small bit of the infection in an attenuated form and this exposure makes one resistant to the real disease. In malaria, if children are continually exposed to malaria, they develop resistance and become immune. As a nation we have talked so much about corruption and had so many committees and inquiries, that we have immunised ourselves against the real thing. Therefore we can go on living with it quite comfortably. At first, the outside agencies were generously providing funds for many of our programmes in health and education, because we were so open in talking about our problems. We were so good at diagnosing and pointing out the rot, that they thought it was only a matter of time before we got the surgeon to cut it out. But over the years they have found that the surgeon has not actually been called and they are slowly coming to the conclusion that he is not coming, so some of them have decided to leave with their money. But Ugandans are generally not bothered, because they feel that if this particular stream of funding is cut off it will be replaced by another stream of oil money. But in the meantime, as we wait for the oil to flow we may have to tighten our belts."546,New Vision (Kampala),6/28/2010,Northern Administrative Officers Warned Against Corruption,,UGANDA (94%),,,Newspaper,Chris Ocowun,ENGLISH,222  words,,29-Jun-10,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (73%)",EXECUTIVES (79%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (78%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (78%); CORRUPTION (70%); ARRESTS (65%) Uganda; Crime and Corruption,"Chief administrative officers (CAOs) in northern Uganda have been warned against paying contractors less than is budgeted for by the Government.

""We are monitoring the PRDP activities with data from the Northern Uganda Data Centre. When we monitored Oyam and Kitgum districts, we found that contracts are awarded at less value than the money released for the construction,"" Toolit remarked. The MP said two health centre IIs under PRDP were demolished by the Oyam leaders because the contractor was using sub-standard materials for construction. Toolit disclosed that sh40m was released for Onono Memorial College, but the contractor was paid only sh34m. He added that sh48m was released for the construction of two units of teacher's houses at the college, but the contractor was paid only sh40m. Toolit warned that the parliamentary accounts committee will audit PRDP funds in August, saying those found guilty of swindling the money will be arrested.

That seems to be the picture from the investigations of the choppers, Global fund, GAVI funds, CHOGM report, NSSF, NFA and now KCC where sh5b is unaccounted for in only one year. It does not help the public to lift the carpet, look at the rot beneath, discuss it, point accusing fingers only to return the carpet in place, leaving the rot intact. Instead, it encourages many others to use their offices to steal more. Thus the saying that as long as it is a lot of money, don't fear to steal because you can use some of it to buy your way out of investigations. In the end, we are harvesting generations of people who get surprised when corruption is frowned upon. Redeeming that situation takes decades. What is wrong?

He said the policy, awaiting Cabinet approval, aims at building a values-based society by generating ethical values on which national integrity and ethical standards can be built. He said when implemented, the policy will enhance behavioural change in society to appreciate the importance of integrity and accountability. The Kasese assistant chief administrative officer, Johnson Mutungwanda, said the district was developing an anti-corruption strategy based on good governance. He said the district would also establish a suggestion box and a corruption complaints desk.

Together with the woman MP, Rebecca Amuge Otengo, and three councillors from the district local government, Ojur signed a memorandum of understanding with the NRM party at the president's country home in Rwakitura."552,New Vision (Kampala),8/9/2010,Donors Cut Aid Over Corruption,,UGANDA (94%); EUROPE (92%); AFRICA (91%); NETHERLANDS (79%); GERMANY (79%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%); NORWAY (79%); DENMARK (79%); BELGIUM (79%); AUSTRIA (69%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (69%),,,Newspaper,Sylivia Juuko,ENGLISH,280  words,,10-Aug-10,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (79%)",INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); BUDGETS (90%); PRIME MINISTERS (78%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (78%); DEVELOPMENT BANKS (77%); BANKING & FINANCE (75%); BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (75%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (74%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (74%); CIVIL SERVICES (73%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (70%); AUDITS (67%); MANAGEMENT THEORY (66%) Uganda; Europe and Africa; International Organizations and Africa; Aid and Assistance; Crime and Corruption,"Donors have slashed aid to Uganda by at least 10%, citing government failure to address high-level corruption.

""The joint budget support development partners had originally planned to provide was $360m (sh773.4b) in form of budget support for the 2010/11 financial year.

The donors that jointly finance Uganda's budget comprise the World Bank, the European Commission and the governments of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Norway, Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. They expressed concern over the Government's failure to take action against several high-level corruption cases, especially the recommendations from the 2008 CHOGM audit reports. They were, however, satisfied with the Government's performance in macro-economic management during the global economic crisis. The donors agreed that the Office of the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Finance had shown strong leadership in pushing for government reforms. While the donors were impressed by the progress in the health, education and water sectors, they noted that performance was weak in the areas of compliance with public financial management principles, and civil service reform, which are critical for efficient service delivery.

Magistrate Immaculate Busingye yesterday referred the case to the Constitutional Court for interpretation at the request of Obel's lawyer Ronald Oine. The lawyer wants the court to determine whether it was right to charge Onegi Obel under the Anti-Corruption Act, which came into force in 2009, yet the charges of abuse of office and causing financial loss he allegedly committed took place between 2003 and 2005. Oine also wants the Constitutional Court to decide whether it is proper for the Inspectorate of Government (IGG) to prefer charges against Onegi Obel when the Attorney General, in his opinion to the President, advised otherwise. Sydney Asubo, the head of prosecution from the IGG's office, said Obel can be charged under the Anti- Corruption Act and the Penal Code. Asubo said the Attorney General's opinion was not biding and that the IGG could still prosecute Obel. ""This is a very serious question of law. I will not go ahead to take plea from the accused until the Constitutional Court has answered the question,"" Busingye said in her ruling. Justice John Bosco Katutsi, on August 23, dismissed the case against Obel after the IGG failed to appear in court. It was later reinstated. Obel is accused of floating an illegal company, Premier, and pushing NSSF to venture with another private company, Mugoya Estates, to build a housing estate. Under the project, 5,000 housing units were supposed to be built by Nsimbe Holdings, a joint venture between Mugoya and Premier. The IGG said the venture was illegal because it did not follow the procurement law."554,New Vision (Kampala),9/27/2010,Poor Investigations Affect Corruption Court,,UGANDA (94%); AFRICA (79%),,,Newspaper,David Ssempijja,ENGLISH,291  words,,28-Sep-10,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (87%)",CORRUPTION (96%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (89%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (88%); APPEALS (78%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (78%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (78%); LITIGATION (78%); DEVELOPMENT BANKS (74%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (73%); TRENDS (70%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (50%) Uganda; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Although the anti-corruption court has struggled to complete 66% of the cases brought before it, most of them have been appealed against, which has delayed their conclusion, the acting principal judge, Opio Aweri, has noted. ""The impact of the Anti-Corruption Court hasn't yet been felt in the public because most of the convictions meted out have been appealed against. When one appeals, the execution of the court orders are stayed until the appeal is disposed of,"" Aweri said. He was presenting a paper on the opportunities and limitations of the Anti-Corruption Court in fighting corruption in Uganda, during a one-day workshop organised by the Uganda Debt Network at Kampala University on Friday. However, the judge noted that the court had successfully disposed of 66% of the registered cases, completed 16 out of 25 criminal appeals, 330 out 384 criminal miscellaneous applications, 31 out of 116 corruption cases and all the 12 criminal revisions brought before it. He said the court business is also hampered by poor investigations, which affect the final outcome of the cases. ""Most of the investigators and prosecutors need training in advanced techniques of investigation,"" Aweri added. He expressed concern that the country's global competitiveness for investment is taking a downward trend due to corruption, which has increased the cost of doing business. ""Uganda is a signatory to the United Nations and African Union conventions against corruption. There is a possibility of invoking these conventions,"" Aweri warned. According to the World Bank report, Uganda loses $500m (sh1.1 trillion) to corruption every year.

Lugoloobi noted that oversight institutions like the Directorate of Public Prosecutions, the Police and the Inspectorate of Government must investigate and cause prosecution of those who are implicated.

However, I was disappointed that the media focused on who had bigger crowds and the chaos that ensued, leaving out the most critical issues that the public wanted to hear or see. I was disappointed that the public was not given an opportunity to air out its views on what they expect to see in their candidates' manifestoes. A big number of Ugandans are poor. So, the candidates should focus on strengthening existing pro-poor programmes or initiate new ones that can benefit the poor and marginalised. Most of the problems people are facing now stem from the fact that they are poor and ignorant. Another big problem we face is corruption, which has deprived people of access to good quality services. According to the National Strategy to Fight Corruption and Rebuild Ethics and Integrity in Public Office 2007, corruption in Uganda has become endemic and systemic. The Annual Corruption Perception Index (CPI) of Transparency International shows that Uganda is among the top 10 most corrupt countries in the world and third most corrupt country in Africa. The reports published by the Inspectorate of Government indicate that corruption has become institutionalised to the extent that all public offices at central and local government level are involved in one form of corruption or another. A study by Uganda Debt Network found that at least sh200m is lost in corruption every year. A number of people in the villages till the land to produce extra food for sale, but cannot deliver their produce to the markets because of the poor state of their roads. Money meant to repair these roads has been swindled by government officials. It is now time for us, Ugandans, to task our leaders to showcase how they intend to fight corruption and strengthen the already existing legal and institutional framework for tackling corruption. The current government has shown commitment to fighting corruption and promoting zero tolerance against corruption but the efforts have been undermined by the actions of some leaders.

""When our people hear that their loved ones have been arrested, the first thing that crosses their minds is where to get the money to have them released,"" Ouma said.

""During my tenure as minister, we caught several 'big fish', but the Government was reluctant to punish them, instead choosing to reward them,"" she said. But Mbabazi said the Government had done its best to fight the vice. He cited the establishment of a legal framework and the anti-corruption court, a free press and parliamentary oversight committees where he said top government officials had been summoned. Mbabazi, however, said the Government lacked the capacity to investigate all corruption cases due to inadequate resources. Niringye said although Uganda put in place good anti-corruption institutions, they had become ineffective due to weak processes.

Besigye said the poverty levels in the country have been exacerbated by the poor infrastructure like gullied-dusty roads and absence or poor quality social services. He said the roads were so bad that President Museveni has resorted to flying around the country during the campaigns and official duty. Besigye promised to establish national food stores that will act as buffers to cushion the country from vagaries of weather and price stabilisation to benefit farmers.

The report advises Uganda to review its judicial process in fighting corruption by, among others, adapting a 60-day timeline for prosecuting corruption cases. The new report approach, called data tracking mechanism, uses actionable indicators that track specific reform and policy changes to measure progress. Produced annually, the report will avoid the one-off studies that fail to track progress.

This gives the power to the people of Uganda to elect leaders of their choice. This power mandates the people to retain those leaders who are doing well or remove those who do not live up to their expectations. People exercise that power without undue influence of any kind, but their conviction that the leaders they choose will offer them social development services and security. Good choices go with provision of services like formulation of good laws, fair distribution of resources, human rights and allows the democratic process to grow. There is a strong need for the Government to sensitise Ugandans about their right and power to elect their leaders. This can easily be done through schools, the Ministry of Information and National Guidance and the Electoral Commission. Many Ugandans are not aware of what it means to have regular elections. Some voters take it as fun; others as a time to reap money and many candidates take it as a matter of life and death. They feel they must win at all costs. Because of such a situation, candidates who lose always oppose the results. This breeds violence and discontent and makes those who have lost in the primaries stand as independents. The vice of buying votes has weakened the electoral process. One can confidently say if one has no money to give out, he/she has no votes. For the poor, good and highly qualified candidates, if nothing is done, they will never see the corridors of power in Uganda. Voters complain that after electing their leaders, the leaders do not go back to the constituencies to account for their actions as elected leaders. They tint their car windows and drive at break-neck speed to avoid voters whom they do not even greet. They do not carry out development activities either. The voters, feeling annoyed and disappointed, promise to revenge by voting them out during the next elections. The elected leaders say they borrowed money from financial institutions or sold their property to contest in the highly competitive campaigns. The borrowed money usually carries high interest rates, so the leaders need time to get money to pay back or to replace the properties sold. That is why they do not go back to their constituencies because the voters will demand more money. It is common knowledge that nobody puts money where it will not make profit. Voters and campaign managers have also changed the style of campaigning. They feel very bad if a candidate goes through unopposed because they are denied a chance to ""eat"". Normally, they urge candidates to join the race, assuring them of strong support. They usually paint a picture that in their areas they are the ones who decide for others and then ask for big money to grease the campaigns. Afterwards many of them vote for opposing candidates. That is why a candidate might fail to get any votes at a polling station even when he or she has more than one agent at the station. It is true money is necessary in running campaigns. However, it should only be used to cater for the campaign teams' transport, refreshments and publicity. But if voters are paid to vote for a particular candidate, then they will never exercise the power to vote for a capable leader. It is important that any form of election must be free and fair so that people accept the results and those who lose elections do not feel cheated. For example, most of the candidates who lost in the party primaries contested the results, saying the elections were manipulated. More so, many losers in the party elections have threatened to stand as independents in the general elections in 2011. This is because they think they were not counselled or given a fair hearing. This is very dangerous because it means the party supporters will be divided, which might make other parties win. As a country, Uganda needs to sensitise both the voters and the candidates and discourage them from 'politics of money'. It is a bad trend, which will ruin the regular elections in our country.

Oguttu said bodies like Transparency International and the international community should join in the fight to help Ugandans to find, recover and repatriate all public funds that have been stolen and stashed away on foreign banks. He cited that in 1999, ministers Maj Gen. Jim Muhwezi and Sam Kuteesa were censured by Parliament for corruption related offences where billions of money were lost from ministry health. He added that in the same year former Vice President, Dr. Specioza Wandira Kazibwe was also implicated in valley dam scandal where sh4b had gone unaccounted for till to date while former minister Kirunda Kivejinja was also forced to resign for allegedly diverting to personal use 2,000 liters of fuel from Uganda Railways. Oguttu said instead of taking a serious action on the culprits, President Museveni absolved and reappointed the same people on promotion to his cabinet, where some have been implicated in other scandals. He said the President's failure to ask Prime Minister, Amama Mbabazi and internal affairs minister, Hilary Onek, to step aside pending investigation into there alleged involvement in the oil scam shows no will by government to fight corruption. Oguttu said this already shows that the ongoing investigations into the oil sector are also likely to come to a naught. He said President Museveni has not taken any decisive action on these cases, which has demoralized those in struggle. ""His recent opposition to the proposed law for people to declare there wealth is enough to show that his talk on zero tolerance to corruption is just empty and clearly shows that government has no will to fight corruption,"" he added. He said besides corruption in cabinet, actors in cases such the 2003 ghost soldiers' scam in which sh1b was lost; loss of about sh3b on purchase of army uniforms, 1998 junk helicopters' scam, remain unpunished and neither money has ever been recovered. ""Given government's failure to stem theft of public funds, we are calling on all people and civil society organizations to join Parliament in demanding government to take action, to recover all the stolen funds and have culprits punished,"" Oguttu said."569,New Vision (Kampala),11/27/2011,Opposition Commends NRM MPs in Fight Against Corruption,,UGANDA (94%),,,Newspaper,Fred Turyakira,ENGLISH,504 words,,28-Nov-11,,CORRUPTION (94%); BRIBERY (91%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); CITY GOVERNMENT (90%); POLITICS (89%); POLITICAL PARTIES (78%); PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (75%); HOTELS & MOTELS (68%); PRESS CONFERENCES (54%) Uganda; Corruption,"THE Rukungiri Municipality Member of Parliament, Roland Mugume Kaginda (FDC) has praised NRM party MPs for joining the opposition in the fight against corruption in the country. ""The ninth parliament is working as a team in the fight against corruption regardless of the various political party affiliations and this is a big achievement for us to work as a team to fight this vice unlike in the past,"" Kaginda said. Kaginda, who is also the Rukungiri district Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) Party chairperson, dismissed the allegations that they were bribed to tarnish the names of the ministers involved in the oil bribery allegations as lies, saying God was behind the unity of NRM Party MPs and opposition to fight corrupt officials for the development of the country. Kaginda said this during a press conference at Grand Holiday Hotel in Mbarara town on Saturday. He added that they were not witch-hunting the ministers Amama Mbabazi, Hillary Onek and Foreign affairs minister, Sam Kahamba Kutesa involved in the oil bribery allegations but were in the interest of saving the nation against corrupt ministers. ""Am surprised there are allegations that we are witch hunting them. I don't know Mbabazi and he is not my opponent or my voter, why should I fight him. We are working for the nation and let everyone carry their own cross. They should step aside and explain to the public how they were bribed and sold our oil."" Kaginda said. He was optimistic that many NRM members will soon cross to the opposition side and follow former NRM strong cadres Col. Dr. Kiiza Besigye, Col. Amanya Mushega, Maj. Gen. Gregory Mugisha Muntu, all in FDC and others if the president continued protecting the corrupt ministers and other government officials. ""I see the boat sinking if president Museveni keeps on protecting Amama Mbabazi, Kutesa and Onek in this matter, there is likelihood of NRM party members exodus joining opposition either FDC party or forming their own because they have seen enough,"" Kaginda explained. He called upon the president to fulfill his pledge of fighting corruption during the state of nation address for development of the country. ""President Museveni called the public to join him in the fight against corruption and I want him to fulfill his pledge and leave the suspected corrupt officials to carry their own cross"" he added. Vicent Mujuni Kyamadidi, the Rwampara county MP (NRM), also told New Vision on Sunday that he wants the president to distance himself from the ministers involved in oil bribery debate. ""I respect President Museveni as my president and my party chairperson but I don't want him to protect the suspected corrupt ministers until their issues were resolved,"" Kyamadidi advised. Kyamadidi added that they were also investigating funds that were given to university leaders and student leaders from other institutions to organize demonstrations in support of the embattled ministers. That said, Police has decided to continue sensitizing the public although the battle seems far from over."570,New Vision (Kampala),12/4/2011,Corruption Feared in Sh28 Billion HIV Deal,,UGANDA (93%); GERMANY (79%),,,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,1213 words,,5-Dec-11,,AIDS & HIV (92%); CORRUPTION (90%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (90%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (89%); DIVESTITURES (78%); HEALTH CARE (74%); IMMUNOLOGIC FACTORS (72%); AIDS & HIV POLICY (72%); SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE (72%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (69%) Uganda; HIV-Aids and STDs; Corruption,"The Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Authority (PPDA) has suspended a deal where about sh28.4b was to be paid for over 200 CD4 count machines that senior officials in the HIV campaign in the Ministry of Health say were not a priority in the HIV budget. The machines, which are used to measure the immunity of a person living with HIV, were supposed to be allocated to Health Centre IVs countrywide. But officials say the money should have been used to put more Ugandans on ARVs. However, the deal was stopped over allegations of corruption. Sources reveal that the National Medical Stores (NMS) recommended a bidder whose machines were deemed inferior and yet quoted a higher figure against the bidder with better ones that cost a lower amount. Complaints about the deal led to PPDA probe and eventual suspension of the transaction. In a letter of April 8, 2011, the health ministry acting permanent secretary, Dr. Asuman Lukwago, wrote to the NMS general manager, Moses Kamabare, requesting him to utilise the money that had been saved from the affordable medicine facility and purchase 200 CD4 machines. By press time, it had not been clarified whether this was the money that had been earmarked for putting more people on ARVs being diverted to buy less urgent machines. After the tendering process, the contracts committee awarded the deal to Alere HealthCare Services Limited on May 4, 2011. But one of the aggrieved bidders then, Biomedics Products, contested the award citing unfairness and sought an administrative review of the tendering process from PPDA. In the same month, PPDA instituted an investigation. In its 11-page report, PPDA boss Cornelia Sabiiti cited irregularities in the tendering process and ordered NMS to suspend the award of the deal that they had given to Alere. PPDA recommended that the deal be re-tendered using open international bidding method with a reduced bidding period from 33 to 21 working days. Alere and Partec Munster Germany submitted bids to supply the CD4 machines to Uganda to NMS. Alere, a South-African based company, was preferred as the best bidder but officials in the health ministry, who did not want to be mentioned given the sensitivity of their positions regarding the tender, questioned the approval. They argued that the machines that Alere was intending to import had 10% possibility to abort results. Documents seen by Saturday Vision show that Alere intended to import PIMA CD4 analyser machines that use cartridges while Partec wanted to import Partec CyFlow miniPOC CD4 machines which use reagents (antibodies). Documents also reveal that Alere quoted $3.47m (sh9b) for the supply while Partec quoted $2.6m (sh6.7b). This means government was going to spend sh2.3b more than what it would have spent on Partec's machines. This is the second time NMS is recommending Alere for the tender, an issue that has raised concern once again. Alere is a much younger firm, founded in 2001 and the PIMA machines that they intended to import were going to be used for the first time in Uganda. On the other hand, Partec was founded in 1967 and has imported dozens of CD4 machines into the country before, according to the company website. Sources revealed that the committee failed Partec because their machines were heavier. Partec's machine weigh 4.9kg including an inbuilt printer while Alere's weigh 2.54kg but without a printer which is supposed to be connected externally. With the printer, the Alere machine could weigh the same as the Partec machine. Specifications also show that Alere's Pima CD4 machine has about 10% possible cases of aborted results, while the Partec machine does not abort results. ""The Partec machine takes one minute to test a patient compared to 20 minutes that Alere's machine takes. Additionally, the Partec machine takes up to 250 patient samples a day compared to Alere's 20. Considering the four tests per patient annually, a Partec machine covers 12,500 patients compared to 1,000 patients covered by Alere's machine in a year,"" a source noted. Documents also show the Alere machine has a capacity to store data of 1,000 tests while the Partec machine stores data of over 20,000 tests. With a Partec machine, the price of a single test is 3 Euros (sh10,500) while for Alere's machine it goes at between 6-8 Euros (sh21,000 - sh28,000). Earlier, the AIDS Control Programme manager, Dr Zainab Akol, told stakeholders in the fight against HIV at Golf Course Hotel that money budgeted for putting people living with HIV on free ARVs had been diverted to purchase CD4 count machines. The meeting noted that it was a bad decision because what the country needed more was to increase people on treatment than the CD4 count machines. Research shows that access to HIV treatment results in a 96% reduction in the risk of HIV transmission through sex. Not only do ARVs improve quality of life, they also reduce the infectiousness of the HIV positive person. Akol said the Government is still relying on foreigners to treat our people. She said she was working hard to add 30,000 more people on free ARVs. Apparently, such diversion of money must be frustrating. ""Currently Uganda only gives free ARVs to less than 50% of the people who need them. Why should we divert money for more ARVs to buying CD4 machines we don't really need urgently?"" a senior person in HIV control at the ministry of health asked. The acting health ministry permanent secretary, Dr. Asuman Lukwago, said the Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL) was the one that recommended Alere's Pima CD4 machine. Tom Tenywa, the laboratory coordinator for the AIDS control programme at CPHL, confirmed that they recommend medical equipment for use in the country to the health ministry. Asked why they had recommended the PIMA CD4 machine, Tenywa, a senior laboratory technologist, refused to comment. ""I cannot tell you that. It is the ministry of health which is better placed to give you that information. Our duty is to recommend on technical grounds."" CPHL is the technical arm of the health ministry charged with ascertaining whether medical equipment is fit for use in the country. It is on CPHL's recommendation that the health ministry approves or rejects medical equipments. Lukwago says the deal was granted to Alere because the ministry's set specifications pointed to the ones that the company had presented. Asked why they chose a company that does not test children below seven years, Lukwago said there was already the Early Infant Diagnosis programme funded by the Clinton Foundation which was recently rolled out in the country to cater for children. ""We recommended Alere over Partec which had a cheaper quotation because in procurement, there are other variables, apart from cost. Value for money does not mean you select the cheapest bid. You may go for low price and get poor quality products."" He, however, said NMS was independently in charge. ""NMS is a self-accounting agency and they report directly to PAC (Public Accounts Committee) of parliament although we sometimes supervise them,"" Lukwago explained. However, NMS General Manager, Moses Kamabare, refused to comment. But earlier, he had been quoted in the media saying Alere had the specifications that the health ministry wanted."571,New Vision (Kampala),12/5/2011,Corruption - Enough Is Enough,,UGANDA (94%),,,Newspaper,Moses Karatunga,ENGLISH,571 words,,5-Dec-11,,CORRUPTION (94%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); BRIBERY (90%); ELECTIONS (89%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (89%); EMBEZZLEMENT (78%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (78%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); BUDGETS (77%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (77%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (75%); EVIDENCE (74%); SCANDALS (73%); ARRESTS (70%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (65%) Uganda; Corruption,"As we commemorate the Anti-Corruption Week running upto December 9, a lot has happened in Uganda this year. Prior to elections, MPs received sh20m each into their accounts purportedly for monitoring government projects in their constituencies, which happened immediately after they passed a huge supplementary budget at the peak of the election campaign. Many concerned citizens termed this transaction as a bribe prompting some MPs to return the money. Former Vice-President Prof. Gilbert Bukenya was arrested for his role in CHOGM Motorcare deal that resulted into loss of billions of public funds. Ministers have taken leave following summons by the Anti-corruption court, while local government ministry officials have been suspended after their alleged involvement in a scam leading to loss of billions of shillings meant for procuring bicycles for local council members. There is also the alleged bribery in the oil sector which is now a subject of investigations. This has triggered off a public debate on whether the documents implicating the ministers were forged or not. All these are indicators of a society riddled with corruption. In some of the findings of a study carried out by Transparency International Uganda, a cross-section of people argue that if a corrupt official embezzled money and used it to develop their area, that is considered fine compared to the one who selfishly takes it all for himself. But also the public is to blame because they have time and again brought back these corrupt officials to public offices by voting them, and they hardly hold them accountable for their actions. We should always advocate transparency in all public dealings. If I might ask, what happened to those implicated in the GAVI and Global Fund scandals, with the exception of the few? Was this money paid back? Now that the Global Fund has run out of money for funding developing countries until 2014, what steps is the Government taking to ensure that drugs are available? I was at a workshop recently and Dr Diana Atwine, the head of medicines and health services monitoring unit in the office of the President, raised an important issue that, whereas she has implicated many health officials on corruption, the weak laws have frustrated her efforts and as a result those implicated are not tried/punished. She blamed the Uganda Law Reform Commission for the weak laws in our country. Such weak laws discourage whistle blowers, who fear being victimised unlike MPs who are protected from prosecution for any utterance while in a parliamentary session. Corruption at health centres and at the district level is adversely undermining effective delivery of health services to the rural poor, who need them and nothing much is being done to address the issue. Most importantly, those implicated in corruption should be forced to refund the money so that it is put to rightful priorities. President Yoweri Museveni has, time and again, advocated zero tolerance to corruption though less has been done to demonstrate commitment to that effect. There is a dire need to address impunity and guarantee sovereignty of courts by all stakeholders. The Government, Civil Society Organisations and the public should come up and fight corruption out of our society and it is every citizen's duty as per Article 17(d) and (i) of the Ugandan Constitution to fight the vice.

In Uganda, the main arm of government that fights corruption is the Inspectorate General of Government. Joshua Kato caught up with the Inspector General of Government (IGG) and below is what he said. Answer: It may not be true that Uganda is one of the most corrupt countries in the world, because Transparency International, which is at the fore front of producing these reports uses perception rather than concrete evidence. And because it is perception, even increased efforts to fight against corruption may be confused for increased incidences of corruption. At the moment for example, Parliament is talking about corruption, all radio talk-shows are about corruption and yet this was not the case before. However, discussing corruption and improving the means by which corrupt tendencies may not necessarily mean actual increase of corruption in the country. It is difficult to describe the level of corruption in Uganda because we are yet to develop a tool that can carry out specific gauging. We depend on the National Survey where we get reports from house-holds, individuals, private and public personalities, which all depends on perception. It is difficult to confirm whether corruption is decreasing or increasing if you are using such system. However, the Economic Policy Research Centre, Makerere recently helped us develop a Data Tracking Mechanism that we are now using to generate reports on corruption using constant indicators so that we can monitor the trends of corruption and get an answer whether it is increasing or decreasing. Here we ask people who have been directly been confronted by corruption. We ask them who the main subject was and that is how we determine basing on the most mentioned institution. In the last report (released in November this year) the areas that were covered included Education, Health and Law Enforcement. However, there was criticism that we should have focused on more institutions. And according to the Data Tracking Mechanism, it showed that corruption was increasing in the targeted sectors, compared to previous years. In most of Europe, only bribery is considered as corruption under the law. In Uganda, the situation is different. The Anti-corruption Act has got at least 20 cases that are considered as corruption tendencies. For example, while abuse of office, negligence of duty, embezzlement of funds, direct bribery, absence from work etc are all chargeable before the law as corruption cases. And because the Uganda Anti-corruption Act has got more listed corruption tendencies, this increases the chances of a case being reported. For example, some body may see a poorly constructed road and he concludes that the engineer must have eaten something hence the shoddy work. However, in actual sense it may be that the engineer was only lazy and did not carry out proper and effective supervision of the road works before he certified it. But the general feeling may be that he must have taken a cut. It is a major concern now, both internationally and locally. Corruption fuels other crimes, for example drug abuse and money laundering, trafficking of arms etc. It is obvious that for one person to move drugs he must have engaged some other person in a corruption tendency. Diverting national resources that are intended for development work has fuelled misery amongst the population because it affects service delivery. Corruption breeds conflicts too. For example, the current conflicts in the Arab world were caused by perceived corruption on the side of the leaders. This is why we need to focus and fighting the evil called corruption. We have had more cases reported than in previous years. We have also had more cases investigated and prosecuted than in previous years. For example in 2010, we successfully took to court 35 cases and of these we won 28, loosing just 7 cases. Comparatively, in 2009, we successfully concluded only one case, 10 in 2008 and so far 17 in 2011. One of the reasons more cases are being reported is the creation of the Whistle Blowers Act. We are getting more people reporting to us as Whistle Blowers, which is good. However, the act needs to be further taken down to the lowest people. The office of the IGG is independent, therefore there is no direct interference. However, in some cases were the subjects of investigations are politicians, the cases are politicised. Most of them claim publically that they are being prosecuted for political reasons. Surprisingly, however, none of them uses the 'political persecution' phrase in the courts as a defence. The entire process of receiving reports from reporters and whistle blowers, carrying out investigations and going to court is selective in nature. We receive more cases than what we can effectively investigate and at the end of the day, refer some of them to other bodies like the PPDA and Public Service. When we undertake cases, we have to prioritise them using several measures. For example, what will be the impact of the case to the public? Has the case got enough evidence to help us win it? Then depending on the results of the investigations, we decide on whether to go to court or not. People who complain that we are doing selective prosecution are mainly those who want certain people prosecuted because they perceive them to be thieves and yet they cannot come out with clear evidence to help us do so. The human resource base and the financial base are both low and yet corruption is widespread around the country. For example, we have this head office here, and 16 regional offices across the country. But compared to 112 districts, it means that each office is in charge of at least eight districts which is too high. The human resource that we have is not sufficiently trained to handle investigations. The public does not also take corruption seriously until it directly affects them."573,New Vision (Kampala),12/10/2011,"Corruption Blamed On Lack of Funds, Citizens Glorifying Vice",,"UGANDA (94%); EASTERN AFRICA (92%); AFRICA (92%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (79%); KENYA (79%)",,,Newspaper,Saudha Nakandha,ENGLISH,1100 words,,12-Dec-11,,CORRUPTION (98%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (90%); SCANDALS (89%); BRIBERY (89%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (86%); PRIVATIZATION (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (78%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (77%); DEVELOPMENT BANKS (77%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (77%); INVESTIGATIONS (76%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (76%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (76%); BUDGETS (75%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (75%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (74%); CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES CRIME (71%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (71%) Uganda; Corruption,"More resources need to be made available to the anti-corruption agencies if the vice of corruption is to be wiped out of the country, Bishop Zac Niringiye, the chairperson of the African Peer Review Mechanism national governing council says. He argues that inadequate resources and funding of especially the Auditor General's office, the Inspectorate of Government and the Criminal Investigations Department has failed all effort in the fight against corruption in the country. Niringiye says according to documentary evidence, corruption is most rife in procurement, privatisation, administration of public expenditure and revenue and in the delivery of public services. This week from Dec 5-9 is the time when the world is celebrating the International corruption week, and the theme for this year is 'Act against corruption Today.' The celebrations are spearheaded by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the United Nations Development programme (UNDP). Yesterday, local civil society and other movements all over the country against corruption celebrated as the culmination of the CSO national anti-corruption week celebrations. The World Bank estimates that Uganda loses over sh500b per year to corruption. (4th October 2010) Recently Transparency International an NGO in ensuring transparency in the world ranked Uganda the 33rd most corrupt country in the world. This ranking comes a time when the country is battling out corruption scandals especially CHOGM and oil. Apart from these scandals much has happened in the previous years, with the most pronounced being incidents such as MPs receiving sh20m each into their accounts purportedly for monitoring government projects in their constituencies, which happened immediately after they passed a huge supplementary budget at the peak of the election campaign. For the public this transaction was termed as a bribe and some MPs were prompted to return the money. According to a study by transparency International in Kenya on the East African countries, the vice is common because the public have failed to report corrupt people to the authorities. According to this study, the propensity to bribe and not report corruption cases fell from 64% in 2008 to 56% in 2009 in East Africa. In Tanzania only 8% of the bribery incidents were reported; indicating a lack of public confidence in the institutions which are supposed to address such complaints. In Uganda the reporting pattern was quite low with 70% of those who paid bribes failing to report the incidents. The top reasons given for not reporting bribery were a lack of faith that any action would be taken and a fear of intimidation. Despite efforts by the media in highlighting corruption scandals in the country the vice has continued taking its routes into society. The New Vision in particular has published stories on corruption as they occur. On August 18, 2009 The New Vision published an article titled 'Police officers held over receiving bribe' but the practice has remained as the police force is ranked the most corrupt institution in the country. On December 4, The New Vision published an article 'corruption feared in sh28b HIV deal'. Others stories like the follow up of the case against the Former Vice-President Prof. Gilbert Bukenya for his role in the CHOGM Motorcare deal that resulted into loss of billions of public funds have always been the lead stories of the paper. These and many other stories have been published, but not much has changed. The vice still goes on. Many local government officials have lost their jobs following their alleged involvement in the bicycle saga that led to loss of billions of shillings meant for procuring bicycles for local council members. Many scholars argue that the vice has been so pronounced in society because corrupt people are uplifted in the country. Findings of a study carried out by Transparency International Uganda, indicates that a cross-section of people say if a corrupt official embezzled money and used it to develop their area that is considered fine compared to the one who selfishly takes it all for himself. This act is glorifying the corrupt. The public here has a role to play and the leaders themselves according to Eunice Musiime the programme coordinator policy at the Uganda National NGO Forum. ""The motivation for graft is largely for leaders to maintain themselves in office and they generate their resources for self-preservation through corruption,"" she says. She says the public is to blame for time and again they vote back corrupt officials into public offices. The public also hardly holds its leaders accountable for their actions. Many have blamed the Uganda Law Reform Commission for the weak laws in our country. They argue that such weak laws discourage whistle blowers, who fear being victimised unlike MPs who are protected from prosecution for any utterance while in a parliamentary session. According to the APRM 2009 review report, Niringiye argues that Uganda has the best and programmes to promote development, but all have failed due to corruption, among other factors. Government Institutions have been seen on many occasions trying to solve the vice by arresting those implicated, but all efforts are futile as no money swindled by the corrupt has been recovered. Recently the Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Authority (PPDA) suspended a deal where about sh28.4b was to be paid for over 200 CD4 count machines that senior officials in the HIV campaign in the Ministry of Health say were not a priority in the HIV budget. The machines, which are used to measure the immunity of a person living with HIV, were supposed to be allocated to Health Centre IVs countrywide. But officials say the money should have been used to put more Ugandans on ARVs. This is one of those effort of the anti-corruption institutions in the country. As Uganda struggles to end the vice others argue that advocating transparency in all public dealings might save the nation from this vice. They suggest that if all those implicated in the Global Fund scandals are punished corruption would not be taken for granted in society. For the CHOGM scandal many were implicated, but only one person has been placed before the court of law to answer charges. Tough measures on those implicated in corruption cases should be taken. Measures like forcing them to refund the money so that it is put to its rightful use. The Government, civil society organisations and the public need to join hands and fight corruption. It is every citizen's duty as per Article 17(d) and (i) of the Constitution to fight the vice."574,New Vision (Kampala),12/12/2011,Corruption Scandals - Lwanga Calls for Calm,,UGANDA (95%),,,Newspaper,Juliet Lukwago,ENGLISH,372 words,,12-Dec-11,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (91%)",CORRUPTION (93%); RELIGION (91%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (90%); SCANDALS (90%); CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY (90%); ENERGY SHORTAGES (87%); CATHOLICS & CATHOLICISM (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); EMBEZZLEMENT (73%); BRIBERY (73%) Uganda; Corruption,"Kampala Archbishop Dr. Cyprian Lwanga has called on Ugandans to remain calm in the wake of mounting revelations of corruption. Dr. Lwanga was speaking at a ceremony in which 22 nuns of the Order of Good Samaritan Sisters took their vows at Mapeera House in Nalukolongo, a Kampala suburb. ""It is with no doubt Ugandans are following events transpiring in Parliament,"" said the cleric, hinting on the recent debates in the House as regards bribery allegations and embezzlement. ""Part of these debates will help Ugandans have an idea of what is going on in their Government and the country at large."" Dr. Lwanga cited corruption scandals and the controversial proposed Public Order Management Bill as some of the highlights that can breed disorder in the community and country at large. He urged all people in their various capacities to fight corruption, which he described as a 'cancerous disease'. He advised the people to emulate the Good Samaritans by starting to help each other and subsequently stop fighting amongst themselves. At the same event, Mbarara diocese retired Bishop John Baptist Kakubi lamented the persistent power load-shedding, saying it caused numerous problems in the country. Kakumbi blamed government for failure to solve such problems for a long a time and urged Umeme to reduce on the load-shedding hours so as to curb the problem of thieves terrorizing innocent people. ""Deceitful people use the cover of darkness when power goes off to mug people at night and steal their valuables,"" the retired cleric explained. He warned that the persistent rationing of electricity is likely to cause more chaos among disgruntled electricity users. At the ceremony, four nuns made their first vows while nine others made their final ones, vowing to observe celibacy, poverty and obedience in compliance with the doctrines of the Catholic Church. The other nine marked 25 years spent as members of the Order. The event was graced by Emmanuel Cardinal Wamala, Bishop of Masaka diocese John Baptist Kaggwa, Bishop of Kiyinda-Mityana Joseph Anthony Zziwa, retired Bishops of Hoima and Fort-Portal, Edward Albert Baharagate and Paul Kalanda, respectively, and Msgr.

According to the State House release, the President also urged ministers to use their proximity to fellow Members of Parliament ""and work closely with them so as to make government work easy, harmonious and efficient."" The statement said President Museveni predicted that Uganda's economy will grow faster and perform better than it has been after overcoming what he referred to as ""a decade of economic sabotage by the political class."" ""He noted that it was not surprising that the country's economy has been growing slowly having experienced sabotage in the electricity sector, more reliance on foreign funding and budgetary support and experienced a long spell of insecurity in some parts of the country,"" the statement said. ""The President said that the country's economy suffered at the hands of political saboteurs especially those who delayed the construction of the Bujagali hydro power project affecting growth in economic areas that require power to survive."" ""He however, said that this will be overcome since the dam will start generating power in April next year. He said that on top of that, government has a Marshall plan to build more power dams in the country and also considering other sources of power to have a lasting solution to the problem of the shortage of electricity."" According to Museveni, the above arrangement in place coupled with the prevailing peace in the entire country and the reduced reliance on foreign funding, Uganda's national the economy will grow in double digits. Consequently, Museveni tasked his Cabinet, ""to always take the trouble and use the largely available mass media and explain these pertinent issues to the public because the citizens are owed accountability from leaders."" The President is said to have proposed increased investment in science and technology and better remuneration for scientists. He also proposed increased investment in the health sector so as to save the estimated US$150m that Ugandans spend annually on treatment abroad. The statement also quoted Museveni as recommending that ""government should make it a taboo to have scarcity of essential commodities"" and said that once detected, solutions should be found quickly and without hesitation. He cited the failure by government to find a quick solution to sugar scarcity which has of recent cost the country US$40 million to import the commodity. Meanwhile, the executive made several recommendations at the end of the retreat. Some of the action points include putting a stop on supplementary budget requests because they negatively impact on budget execution and performance. A special contingency fund will instead be provided for in the next budget to cater for eventualities. The ministers also agreed to undertake a review of local governments funding and guidelines because much of the money never reaches to the common man. The meeting also agreed on the need to beef-up staffing in the local governments from the current 55% to 75% for better service delivery. On complaints from district chairmen over declining funding from the central government, the cabinet agreed to undertake a comprehensive review of sources of revenue for local governments. As part of the solutions to the high fuel prices, it was agreed that Jinja fuel storage tanks be refurbished for storage of reserve fuel which can save the nation in times of scarcity."576,New Vision (Kampala),12/23/2011,"Catholic Church Slams Corruption, Bad Laws",,UGANDA (92%),,,Newspaper,Henry Mukasa,ENGLISH,328 words,,27-Dec-11,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (90%)",RELIGION (94%); CORRUPTION (92%); CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY (91%); CLERGY & RELIGIOUS (90%); CATHOLICS & CATHOLICISM (90%); ARRESTS (90%); CORRECTIONS (89%); VEHICULAR OFFENSES (89%); DRIVER BEHAVIOR (87%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); ORGANIZED CRIME (78%); SEX OFFENSES (76%); MURDER (76%); DOMESTIC OFFENSES (76%); DOMESTIC VIOLENCE (71%); TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS (71%); BAIL (65%) Uganda; Religion; Corruption,"The Archbishop of Kampala Diocese Dr. Cyprian Kizito Lwanga has criticized corruption, human rights violation and bad laws saying they do not augur well with the message of peace, justice and reconciliation brought by Christmas.

Dr. Lwanga made the remarks at a news conference held at his residence in Rubaga a Kampala suburb. Delivering his Christmas message, Lwanga called for political reconciliation and condemned violence. He, however, hailed the ninth Parliament for its stand against corruption and urged MPs not to give up with the fight against corruption. Commenting about the brutal arrest of a catholic priest over reckless driving, Lwanga condemned the manner in which the priest was arrested and bundled onto police pick up like a chicken thief. Police on Tuesday arrested a priest suspected to have knocked dead a police-man near River Katonga on the Kampala- Masaka road. He was charged with reckless driving and remanded to Buwama prison but was granted bail by Grade 1 Magistrate Catherine Agwero the following day. Bishop Lwanga said the priest was accused for a crime he did not commit. ""I talked to the priest and he explained that he was not the driver of the ill-fated car.

She was addressing the week-long Vital Voices Pan-African Leadership Summit for Women and Girls which opened in the city yesterday. ""To begin to even fight it and get people to believe something is going to happen, you have to make information available (to civil society),"" she added. Iweala described the publication in Nigeria of the government's revenue sources as well as officials' salaries and expenses as a ""powerful force"" in combating corruption. Corruption, when it existed, was often embedded in a country's economy, so fighting it was an ""integral part of development efforts"", she said. A neglected subject was the role developed countries played in fostering corruption in developing countries: demand from developed countries was fuelling supply in developing countries. Meg Taylor, compliance adviser/ombudsman for the International Finance Corp-oration/World Bank Group, said that in her country - Papua New Guinea - a leadership code had been set up by an ombudsmen commission. All members of parliament and those who held constitutional office were forced to sign the code. If they breached it, they could be recommended for dismissal by the commission. She added that, in Hong Kong, if a member of parliament was seen to be living beyond his or her means, the independent commission against corruption there had the power to seize that individual's financial records and investigate. Former assistant administrator for the United States Agency for International Development, Sally Shelton Colby, described the ""citizen charter"" pioneered by the British and Indian governments to provide services at the highest quality and lowest possible cost to the public. If such service was not received, there was a mechanism for people to complain. She also emphasised the importance of a non-political and modern audit system. Archbishop Njongonkulu Ndungane, founder of Africa Monitor set up to monitor aid to Africa and what local governments do with the money, said accountability and transparency was most effective when there was ""mass ownership of development""."579,Cape Times (South Africa),2/19/2007,Moves to let prisons' watchdog body put bite on corruption,e2 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (94%),NEWS; Pg. 6,CT,Newspaper,Linda Daniels,ENGLISH,321 words,,23-May-07,,CORRECTIONS (93%); PRISONS (93%); INVESTIGATIONS (92%); CORRUPTION (90%); CORRECTIONS WORKERS (78%),"THE Ministry of Correctional Services could consider extending the prisons oversight body's powers to include investigating corruption, in a department persistently dogged by scams. Answering a question from the Cape Times during a parliamentary briefing, Deputy Correctional Services Minister Loretta Jacobus said they were willing to consider broadening the mandate of the Judicial Inspectorate of Prisons, whose powers are currently restricted to investigating conditions inside jails. ""I think as a department we would be amenable to look at that, but it should be the result of the outcome of a public process ..."" she said. The report of the Jali Commission, which investigated corruption in the department, noted that the inspectorate was merely a reporting body and that, internationally, oversight bodies had much greater legitimacy if they also had decision-making powers. Judge Thabani Jali suggested that a prisons ombudsman should be established to investigate corruption. Last year, the National Assembly's correctional services committee said it would debate this suggestion. However, the head of the Judicial Inspectorate of Prisons, Judge Nathan Erasmus, warned against overloading the body with too much responsibility. Judge Erasmus said that while the inspectorate could not investigate corruption, Correctional Services had instead enlisted Willie Hofmeyr's special investigating unit to probe corruption in prisons. The Jali Commission report highlighted chronic corruption in the Department of Correctional Services. Jacobus said the report was not being ignored. ""Even before the submission of the ... report and subsequent making public thereof, we had Correctional Services set up an anti-corruption unit which was headed by our former commissioner. The work in that unit is ongoing, looking into corruption generally within the department, but also looking at the implementation of the ... report,"" he said."580,Cape Times (South Africa),3/5/2007,No joy for Zuma as state vacillates on corruption charge,e1 Edition,MAURITIUS (95%); FRANCE (72%),NEWS; Pg. 4,CT,Newspaper,TANIA BROUGHTON,ENGLISH,274 words,,23-May-07,,CORRUPTION (91%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (89%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%); EXECUTIVES (78%); BRIBERY (78%); LITIGATION (75%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (75%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (74%); INJUNCTIONS (69%),"DURBAN: The state has ducked a challenge by ANC deputy president Jacob Zuma to say whether it intends to prosecute him on corruption charges, saying it is ""impossible to predict"".

But in his reply, Scorpions investigating officer Isak du Plooy says only: ""I can confirm that no decision has been taken regarding the prosecution ... It is impossible to predict when a decision will be made."" The matter is expected to be argued in the Pietermaritzburg High Court on March 22. At issue are several documents being held under court injunction in Mauritius, which the state believes are crucial to the prosecution of Zuma and Thint. They include the diary of Alain Thetard, Thint's former SA chief executive, which allegedly notes a meeting between him, Zuma and Zuma's former financial adviser, Schabir Shaik, in March 2000. The state contends that it was at this meeting that the bribe by Thint to Zuma was brokered. This, and other documents were seized in raids on Thint's Mauritian offices in 2000. Copies were made which were later used at Shaik's trial. In the interim, Thint secured a court order in Mauritius, preventing their disclosure to any other party.

Written and directed by Thami Mbongo, the work is called Things are Bad - or in Xhosa, Ijumpile lendaba. ""It tells the story of how young men get together and how this escalates into crime which gets even more serious when the police become involved. The men then get involved with the notorious numbers gangs,"" explains Maurice Podbrey, the producer, on behalf of the Canadian-funded Mopo Cultural Trust. Says Mbongo, a UCT graduate: ""For me, I read every day about crime in our townships and too much about police and our government and this while we are waiting to hear who our next leader is going to be. ""What is the government going to do about crime and corruption? I thought it would be a good idea to put all these things in a play, so that the play would open up discussions about all the people involved. So that people can ask themselves what role they can play to put a stop to crime."" Mbongo says his play is not anti-government or anti-ANC. ""The point,"" Podbrey says, ""is what are the people in power doing about crime and corruption? ""The people who put them there must recognise what's happening,"" Podbrey adds, saying that a discussion has been held after every show. ""The response (from township audiences has been great, with the play being performed in 'tsotsitaal', Xhosa, Afrikaans and English, depending in which area we're performing, from Khayelitisha to Ocean View,"" Mbongo says. ""The play is not so much about the 'number' gangs inside the prisons, but rather about the ex-prisoner who, after he is released, sees his family doing well, being successful, but all he has is his 'number'."" Mbongo explains that people come to the play because it reflects what they have to deal with every day. Significantly, as opposed to television, the theatre experience allows them to discuss the issues raised. It would also be good Mbongo says, to have the so-called role players, such as prison warders, politicians and officials as well as policemen coming to the performances. Podbrey adds that it would be ""marvellous"" to have the play performed inside prisons. A central theme in the play, Mbongo explains, is the idea of individuals taking responsibility for their lives, and not pandering to the expectations placed on them, effectively looking at the negative effects of peer pressure on the youth. ""Young people think it's cool to be involved in crime, but they don't know what life is like in prison,""the playwright says. ""Also, young people in townships tend to think what other people expect of them and they do things to please others. ""Instead one has to sit down and ask oneself 'what do I really want in life'."" After the run with this production, Mbongo will go to Denmark, hosted by the Danish government, to give drama workshops in Copenhagen.

Eight other African countries - Algeria, Burundi, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Togo and Uganda - were also fingered in a study by global civil society movement, Transparency International (TI). The report said that these countries all had legal gaps regarding the provisions of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) and the African Union's Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption and Related Offences. Department of Public Service and Administration spokesperson Lewis Rabkin said yesterday that the department would comment once it had obtained a copy of the report and studied its findings. Transparency International said it had been monitoring the implementation of the anti-corruption policies since the AU convention came into effect in August. The studies, released in Berlin, Germany, analysed anti-corruption measures and highlighted the shortcomings of the reform process. TI said a common feature in most countries was the absence of comprehensive national strategies to combat corruption and a lack of real political will to implement reforms. The vice-chairperson of TI's board, Akere Muna, said yesterday that the implementation of anti-corruption policies should be a top priority and that his organisation would continue to exert pressure until it was. ""The AU convention provides a very useful template to guide such a process. ""In concert with civil society, TI will continue to lobby governments and legislators on how best to cope with the obvious challenges posed by this process,"" said Muna. Governments were required to report back on the progress made by completing a questionnaire for the next UN Conference of States Parties in February next year. However, TI also encouraged civil society organisations to use the findings of the nine country studies to complete the same questionnaire. Only 16 of 53 African countries have ratified the AU convention. TI said the record for UNCAC was slightly better, with 29 ratifications. However, a low turnout of African countries at the first Conference of States Parties to the UN Convention in December last year raised doubts about the continent's commitment to the convention."583,Cape Times (South Africa),5/21/2007,Audit puts spotlight on alleged corruption of R4m by officials,e2 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (94%),NEWS; Pg. 3,CT,Newspaper,VUSUMUZI KA NZAPHEZA,ENGLISH,396 words,,23-May-07,,AUDITS (92%); CORRUPTION (91%); INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); INTERNAL AUDITS (90%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (89%); MISCONDUCT (89%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (89%); WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (89%); LABOR MEDIATION & ARBITRATION (87%); PUBLIC FINANCE (78%); LABOR UNIONS (76%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (76%); INSPECTIONS (72%); MAINTENANCE & REPAIR (69%),"AN INTERNAL audit has uncovered alleged corruption at the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry's Worcester office estimated at R4 million, including R400 000 spent on two golf carts and trailers. A copy of the confidential audit report in the possession of the Cape Times shows senior officials may have contravened the department's procurement procedures and failed to comply with the Public Finance Management Act when they authorised the purchase of the golf carts, or tunnel vehicles, for R200 000 each. The investigation was triggered by an anonymous call in 2005 to the department's hotline for reporting corruption. The probe concluded that reasonable care had not been exercised when the vehicles had been bought. The vehicles were bought for routine inspections and maintenance at Bulshoek dam but could only be used once a year and were bought from SPEC Limited, which had a two-year R2m maintenance contract with the department. It was owned by Arnold Avanant, a former employee of the department. The audit recommended that Worcester area manager Thys Fourie and chief engineer Wally Kolmeyer, who were responsible for the purchase of the vehicles, be charged with misconduct and that the two vehicles be sold to recover the irregular expenditure. But this was not done, according to the National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu). The trade union is involved in a tussle with the department after one of its members and former department employee, Raleigh Mpekula, was dismissed in the wake of the investigation. Mpekula claims he was dismissed on trumped-up charges when officials in Worcester decided he was the whistleblower. Mpekula and Nehawu took the dispute to the General Public Services Sectoral Bargaining Council in a bid to have the department release a report of its 2002 investigation of the Worcester office. That probe was apparently ordered by former Water Affairs Minister Ronnie Kasrils. Despite being ordered to, the department had failed to release the report to Nehawu and Mpekula. Nehawu and Mpekula insist the whistleblower report is crucial to Mpekula's arbitration with the department as it alleged ""gross misconduct involving senior managers in the Western Cape"".

The four informed the city in January of illegal water connections in Philippi. The information led to an internal audit investigation which confirmed that two Philippi farmers had made illegal connections to the city's water supply. The farmers had stolen water to the value of more than R2.2m. A complaint of theft has been made with the police and the farmers will have to reimburse the city for the stolen water.

This was one of a number of revelations made by senior officials from the department during a briefing to parliament's home affairs portfolio committee on Friday. Chief of immigration, Yusuf Simons, told committee members that ""as soon as we fill vacancies our counter- corruption strategies create new vacancies - so staff turnover continuously takes place"". Simons also admitted that infrastructure problems, limited resources, poor management and the growing influx of refugees and immigrants - legal or otherwise - from the rest of the continent were placing a huge strain on immigration services. Committee chairman Pat-rick Chauke called the department's immigration services a ""shameful embarrassment"". ""With the birth of Zimbabwe in 1980, the majority of the white Zimbabweans did not go to Britain. They came to South Africa ... There were no refugee camps,"" he said. ""We as South Africans have a responsibility to make sure the welfare of our neighbours is taken seriously because the condition they find themselves in is the legacy of colonialism and apartheid."" Director-General Mavuso Msimang also appeared before the committee to explain what steps had been taken to rectify problems at the Marabastad immigration centre in Tshwane since committee members dropped in unannounced at the beginning of the month. ""Appalling"", ""chaotic"", ""un-friendly"" and ""filthy"" were some of the remarks that committee chairman Patrick Chauke used on Friday to describe what he had seen at the centre. The health department had even condemned the centre as a ""slum"" and a serious health risk. According to Msimang and Simons, much has since been done to improve the situation. Committee members complimented the department on its thorough feedback and undertook to visit the centre again in mid-October. l According to the department's annual report for the period April 1, 2005 to March 31, 2006, 73 disciplinary hearings were finalised over this period and 70 officials were found guilty of an offence. In 30 cases the offences involved ""aiding and abetting corruption"", while 27 officials were charged for bribery and 16 others for fraud or making false statements. In the salary band classified as ""highly skilled supervision"", 292 out of 673 posts remained unfilled - a vacancy rate of about 56%. To fill these posts, regulations required that each post be evaluated.

This was part of Premier Ebrahim Rasool's response during question time in the provincial legislature yesterday where he said an independent investigation by Sonnenbergs had exonerated Ramatlakane of fraud and corruption. Sonnenbergs's findings, Rasool said, corroborated the AG's, that the overspend resulted from communication lapses between Ramatlakane's department and the Department of Transport and Public Works (DTPW), and system weaknesses in supply-chain management, among others. In response to DA MPL Robin Carlisle's questions on how the executive dealt with the issue, Rasool said after Sonnenbergs presented its report in March, disciplinary steps were taken against five employees - four in DTPW and another in Community Safety. ""In addition it came to my attention that the upgrade of the MEC's residence, was not part of the AG's original sample, but was handed to the AG outside the normal communication. This was a worry to me, as the AG's office had for three years not picked up accumulated fraud and corruption in excess of R1 million where syndicates of employees had systematically defrauded the Department of Community Safety. ""The coincidence of these two facts led me to prepare a tender for a further forensic investigation to determine whether the operation of the AG's office could have been compromised by having been fed information of a high-profile nature, and whether it was meant to distract the AG from finding the actual syndicated fraud and corruption,"" Rasool said. ""Given the possible connection between the deliberate handing over of this and other matters to various bodies, including the AG, the fraud uncovered and the fact that we have procured an investigation to determine whether the AG may have been compromised - it was not possible to divulge this sensitive information and to communicate it openly,"" Rasool said. Newly appointed department director Gilbert Lawrence conceded in July to the provincial standing committee on public accounts that the supply chain management was a ""high-risk"" area.

Manuel wrote a letter at the weekend to Absa chief Steve Booysen taking issue with the proposed payment of some R50 million to five Professional Soccer League (PSL) officials - Irvin Khoza, Kaizer Motaung, Manto Madlala, Trevor Phillips and Peter Mancer - who secured a R500m sponsorship from the bank. Some might say that the target of the ministerial annoyance should be the PSL, rather than Absa, which has said that it did not agree to the payments. Certainly the league must be called to account, especially since the payment of enormous commissions on deals negotiated by officials seems somehow to have become routine. Such commissions, as Manuel said, may indeed be ""wrong, morally reprehensible and corrupt"". The same five administrators - who comprise the league's sponsorship committee - lined up for R30m each a few months ago when they secured a five-year R1.6 billion broadcast rights deal with SuperSport International. But Absa should not be let off the hook either. The bank must take some responsibility for the way in which the sponsorship is to be handled. The bank could have made it a condition of the sponsorship, for instance, that no commissions are paid to officials, who, in any case, are simply doing what they are elected to do. Khoza said yesterday that the payment of the commissions had not yet been finalised. Perhaps there is still time to set the matter right. If not, both the league and Absa will have some explaining to do when the chairperson of the National Assembly's sport committee, Butana Khompela, calls them before the committee, as he has said he will do."598,Cape Times (South Africa),10/12/2007,How greed and corruption help turn one of nature's miracles into a tragedy,e1 Edition,KENYA (88%); AFRICA (88%); EASTERN AFRICA (73%),NEWS; Pg. 11,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,739 words,,11-Oct-07,,MAMMALS (90%); WILDLIFE (90%); CORRUPTION (82%); PRIMATES (76%); LAND USE PLANNING (76%); RIVERS (74%); LAKES (74%); MALARIA (72%),"THERE is an image that will stay with me as long as I live. We had been in the Serengeti for several weeks at the height of the great wildebeest migration. This was quintessential Africa: vast plains of tawny grass dotted with umbrella trees, a sea of milling wildebeest and zebra, grunting and snorting in a mad bedlam of insane noise. We followed the migration out of the park and into the Grumeti conservation area, a corridor of protected land where nomadic pastoralists and wildlife live side by side. An hour before sunset, we set up camp at the foot of a small koppie looking down towards the Grumeti River. We were in the Garden of Eden. Spread before us on the plains was one of the greatest wildlife spectacles on Earth: thousands upon thousands of animals, wildebeest, zebra, giraffe, ostrich, kongoni, elephant, lion, Thompson's gazelle. They moved unquietly back and forth, politely keeping a hundred metres from our camp. Late into the night the grunting and groaning continued, singing us to sleep. We woke to silence. The plains were empty. Not a single animal remained. They had ghosted off in the night, leaving us wondering if we had imagined it all. That is the miracle of the great migration that moves restlessly back and forth across the vast plains of East Africa. The migration is a fickle thing and totally dependent on rainfall - and hence grass growth - patterns. In a perfect world, the wildebeest, zebra and gazelles start migrating west and north in search of sweeter grazing from May through to July, moving from Seronera through the Western Corridor, then outside the park to the Grumeti, arriving in the Maasai Mara in Kenya by late July through to early September. By October or November, they are drifting back to Seronera, and spend the long rainy season in the Serengeti grasslands. With plenty of time and a fistful of dollars, it is possible to witness both ends of the spectacle, following the migration almost to the shores of Lake Victoria, then across the border into Kenya and down the Soit Olol Escarpment into the Mara. That's the way we did it - with plenty of time and almost no dollars at all. We bush camped wherever we ended up for the night, moving with the vast herds, from Lake Manyara in the east, down into the Olduvai Gorge, then across the Serengeti, through the Grumeti and down the Soit Olol into the Mara. It was an extraordinary journey, battling cotton mud and swarms of malarial mosquitoes, with regular visits to our camps by curious lions and marauding baboons. The apex moment was when we got to the Mara, Talek and Sand Rivers and watched over several days as tens of thousands of wildebeest and zebra milled and charged into the waters, often into the jaws of the waiting crocodiles. Those in front have no option but to jump as the pressure builds up from behind. This is one of the most exciting wildlife spectacles on earth, an extraordinary experience that cannot be described in words. But this year was different. East Africa has been pounded by torrential rains, and last Friday the Mara River burst its banks. Conservationists estimate that as many as 20 000 wildebeest were swept away and drowned as they tried to cross. The crocodiles, hyenas and marabou storks will be fat and bloated this year. And while the heavy rains are partly to blame for the unprecedented deaths, there is a more sinister, man-made reason behind the floods, and it is twofold. First, the Maasai Mara lies spread out in the southern shadow of the mighty Mau Escarpment, one of Kenya's most beautiful and rugged Afromontane ranges, a range that creates its own micro-climate. But illegal logging, often by companies with close links to ruling party politicians, and mass clearing of forest for coffee and tea plantations, have stripped vast areas of their indigenous forest. Second, while the Serengeti is, in the main, vast and trackless, the Maasai Mara is criss-crossed with illegal vehicle tracks made by unscrupulous safari mini-buses trying to get their mostly foreign clients close to the lions. Erosion dongas and desertification of the grasslands are a massive problem. Combined with the hugely increased runoff from the Mau Escarpment, runoff that is unchecked by the once mighty forests, the Maasai Mara has long been an ecological disaster waiting to happen. And Friday's mass drowning of the wildebeest could well be an ominous harbinger of far worse things to come. tony.weaver@inl.co.za"599,Cape Times (South Africa),10/17/2007,'corruption uncoverer' suspended,e1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (94%),NEWS; Pg. 3,CT,Newspaper,NATASHA JOSEPH,ENGLISH,554 words,,16-Oct-07,,INVESTIGATIONS (91%); MISCONDUCT (90%); CORRUPTION (89%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%); AGREEMENTS (78%); CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS (76%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (75%); JOURNALISM (75%); EXECUTIVES (74%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (74%); FORENSICS (69%); WRITERS (68%),"THE CapeNature Board's suspended deputy chairperson, Yasmina Pandy, has accused Environment, Planning and Economic Development MEC Tasneem Essop of ""poor governance"" and has called on Western Cape Premier Ebrahim Rasool to ""spend time ... educating"" his cabinet on issues of good conduct. On Friday, Essop issued a statement announcing that Pandy had been suspended. In the statement, Essop also said she intended ""removing (Pandy) as a board member for disclosing confidential information in an unauthorised manner and contravening a signed confidentiality agreement between (Pandy) and the CapeNature Board"". The embattled conservation agency made headlines after it was revealed that an independent forensic investigation had uncovered numerous instances of financial misconduct by senior managers. The report was leaked to members of the province's standing committee on environment and community development and journalists. Early last month, Essop took charge of the investigation into financial misconduct and started an investigation into the leaking of confidential CapeNature documents. On September 20, the Cape Times received copies of two documents, both authored by Pandy. The first, dated September 3, contained board meeting minutes, and e-mails between board members. It was addressed to standing committee chairperson Zodwa Magwaza.The second, dated September 19, called on Magwaza to investigate the board's alleged ""cover-up ... regarding poor governance by (Essop) and the acting CEOs"". ""I would like to inform the committee that I have become extremely uncomfortable about the behaviour of members of the board of CapeNature,"" said Pandy in one of the documents. Ten days ago, three senior managers were suspended and nine staff members received written warnings. Speaking to the Cape Times yesterday, Pandy said she had found out about her suspension on Friday after reading newspaper posters. She had seen headlines announcing her suspension before she returned home to find an official letter from Essop. She said the MEC was ""only concerned about (media) leaks"" and was not investigating issues of financial misconduct. Pandy flatly denied that she was responsible for information leaks. In her letter to Rasool, Pandy asked why Essop was not investigating the conduct of acting CapeNature CEO Nazeem Jamie and members of the board. Pandy, a devout Muslim, was also furious that Essop had issued the notice of suspension just one day before Eid. In a letter addressed to Essop, Pandy said she found it ""strange"" that she was being suspended. ""I am the person responsible for uncovering the corruption and financial mismanagement at CapeNature,"" Pandy said in the letter. Essop's spokesperson, Nils Flaatten, said Pandy needed to provide evidence to back up her claims. ""This is not a media slugfest,"" said Flaatten. ""(The MEC's office has) been very candid, we have explained the processes that are under way."" ""In those processes, Pandy has the opportunity to make representations."" Flaatten said Pandy had until the close of business on Friday to explain to the MEC why she should not be removed from the board. Pandy, who has been a board member for three years, said she was ""most definitely"" fighting her suspension. A spokesperson for Rasool could not confirm if he had received Pandy's letter. natasha.joseph@inl.co.za"600,Cape Times (South Africa),12/13/2007,'Lethal cocktail' of corruption mars HIV/Aids plan,e2 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (94%),NEWS; Pg. 1,CT,Newspaper,A'EYSHA KASSIEM,ENGLISH,334 words,,13-Dec-07,,AIDS & HIV (96%); ANTIVIRALS (90%); PREVENTION & WELLNESS (90%); CORRUPTION (89%); BUDGETS (78%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (78%); AIDS & HIV TREATMENT (78%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (77%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (73%); POLITICS (67%),"STOLEN anti-retrovirals, the lack of financial monitoring mechanisms, dire poverty and a lack of accountability all make up the ""lethal cocktail"" hindering the prevention of HIV/Aids in South Africa.

The report was compiled by ISS researcher Collette Schulz-Herzenberg, who says the ability to control corruption in the prevention of HIV/Aids is as dramatic and clear-cut as a choice of life over death. ""Corruption in the HIV/Aids sector is largely unreported. Where corruption exists, it appears to be a result of several factors such as weak institutions and a lack of enforcement of policy and regulations. ""Abuses of political power occur where the relevant political institutions are either too weak or unwilling to curb them. Corrupt activities, particularly among HIV-infected people, appear to be a direct result of high poverty and inequality"", states the report, which looks at why, despite large amounts of money being pumped into the prevention and treatment of HIV/Aids, results have been slow and minimal. Schulz-Herzenberg said there were ""significant challenges"" in the distribution of funds towards treatment and prevention, which was one of the stumbling blocks. Her findings indicate that budget-tracking mechanisms appear to be lacking in terms of what is being spent and where it is going - resulting in some international donors withdrawing their funding. There was also no clear database of donor funding, posing a risk of duplication of resources and efforts between the government and NGOs. The lack of accountability was particularly a ""source of concern"", coupled with the ""lack of transparency"".

The Department of Justice and Constitutional Development has, among its primary objectives, combating, preventing and mitigating risk in relation to the resources and responsibilities we manage on behalf of the citizens of our province and country. We continue to find ways to integrate our anti-corruption policy with our risk management profile and to ensure a collaborative onslaught against corruption and bad practices that rob our people of a deserved service excellence. We recognise that the value system underpinning the public sector needs to be corruption resistance, as corruption impedes the capacity of the government to deliver justice services to our customers. Corruption is almost universally defined as ""abuse of public office for private gain"". The difficulty is that such definitions ignore and downplay the role of patronage, and underestimate the extent to which corporate gain motivates acts of corruption. Concerted state intervention is needed to redress the legacy of apartheid. The use of the state to redirect accumulation processes and to ensure redress of historical imbalances heightens the risk of corruption. Thus, there is a demand for high levels of integrity, to prevent empowerment strategies from being compromised by patronage and personal enrichment. Corruption drains state resources and weakens capacity to meet the needs of its people. It hampers the state's ability to create opportunities for advancement and growth. Our new democratic government has, in recent years, introduced a number of measures to fight corruption and bring to justice those who engage in corrupt activities. The 2004 Anti-Corruption Conference highlighted the need to raise public awareness about corruption. Sixteen resolutions were passed, with the main focus on the National Anti-Corruption Strategy, community understanding, stakeholder commitment and the participation of civil society in fighting corruption. At the national conferences, a number of resolutions were passed on oversight, accountability, whistle-blowing, co-ordination and the challenges of dealing with corruption. The following actions were initiated by government: l We have implemented stringent screening mechanisms for all Department of Justice employees and have deployed draft legislation to regulate post-public sector employment of possible corrupt individuals. l Accredited ethics officers have been appointed to ensure all departments have adequate capacity to fight corruption. Programmes for anti-corruption practitioners, including staff and prosecutors, have been implemented. l A major achievement has been the expansion of our legislative framework. The Promotion of Access to Information Act of 2004 was supported by the Protected Disclosures Act. The main piece of legislation, though, is the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act, 2004. This replaces the 1992 act and produces a wider net by providing specific categories of offences involving corrupt activities. According to the act, any person who gives or accepts gratification in order to act in an improper exercise of a duty or a power, is guilty of corruption. l Other notable achievements include the establishment of a specialised commercial crimes court for corruption cases; the National Anti-Corruption Forum, a multi-sectoral co-ordinating group to help develop a national anti-corruption programme; the Directorate: Special Operations (of the National Directorate of Public Prosecutions), to focus on organised crime; and the Assets Forfeiture Unit, which is making serious inroads into recovering the ill-gotten gains of criminals and corrupt officials. In trying to prevent corruption, we have made it compulsory for all departments to conduct risk assessment and implement fraud prevention plans. We have also opened anti-corruption hotlines and have introduced procedures to institute disciplinary action against corrupt individuals. We will pursue disciplinary procedures against any staff member charged with corruption. Accounting officers of government departments have also been given the responsibility of implementing risk management plans. This is necessary to ensure risks that could impede the strategic objectives and achievements of a department are identified and adequately and effectively mitigated. Section 38 of the Public Finance Management Act of 1999 further requires accounting officers to maintain an effective, efficient and transparent system of financial and risk managements and internal controls. The Department of Justice and Constitutional Development is committed to strengthening the integrity of our courts, and ensuring that leadership by court managers is clearly demonstrated through a commitment to a value system based on the fundamentals of honesty, integrity and fairness. We will carefully measure the standards for each of the services we deliver, and spot checks and inspectors will be used to assess general compliance with the principles of Batho Pele. Corruption of any kind will not be tolerated. As we fight the pervasive cancer of corruption, we will continue to rely on our accountants and ourselves as patriotic managers to help our country and people to eradicate corruption. l Advocate Mohamed is the regional head of the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development, Western Cape.

According to the World Conservation Union (IUCN), several heavily exploited fish species are being illegally re-labelled as ""ecofish"" to pass them off as common or abundant species. Accurate records on the number of fish hauled out of the sea were also being distorted, making it difficult for scientists to set sensible recommendations on sustainable catch rates. A briefing paper to be presented to a meeting at the World Bank in Washington today notes that China is being used extensively to ""launder"" fish which have been caught illegally or unsustainably, while land-locked nations like Mongolia are providing flags of convenience for hundreds of sea fishing boats. Researchers from the University of British Columbia say several cases of corruption have also been documented in South Africa. One of the most highly publicised examples involved Arnold Bengis, a wealthy dual citizen of South Africa and the United States who bribed 18 South African fisheries officers to conceal exports of illegal rock lobster and Patagonian toothfish. Bengis and his son, David, were arrested in August 2002 following a three-year investigation involving the Scorpions and the US Department of Customs and Immigration. Bengis was eventually jailed for 46 months and fined $5.9 million following a plea bargain agreement before the US Attorney's Southern District of New York. During one of the illegal shipments from South Africa to the US, a large consignment of illegally caught Patagonian toothfish was hidden below a thin layer of rock lobster and other fish. More recently, in July 2005, the captain of a South Korean fishing vessel was caught trying to bribe a South African fisheries observer who had video-taped the crew chopping the fins and tails off sharks and then tossing their bleeding bodies back into the sea. Globally, it is estimated that 20% of all fish which enter the market have been caught illegally or in an unregulated manner. According to Dr Cathy Roheim of the University of Rhode Island, US, large volumes of illegally caught fish are being laundered through China, where processed fish are labelled legally as ""product of China"". Elsewhere, Patagonian toothfish are labelled as ""sea bass"" or cut into fillets to deceive customs agents. Roheim has suggested that governments should rely more on electronic documentation rather than paper documents, which are easily forged. She has also called for a worldwide ban on fish trans-shipments at sea to prevent legally caught fish being mixed up with illegal cargoes, out of sight of inspectors. Carl Gustav Lundin, the head of the IUCN Global Marine Programme, will also be calling for satellite tracking of fishing vessels, better labelling protocols for fish and better enforcement of current rules. However, officials note that the problem of illegal fishing and corruption is especially prevalent in many small island nations which rely heavily on a fisheries economy. Australian academic Martin Tsamenyi noted in a briefing paper that several Pacific islands depended heavily on foreign aid money, while senior government officials also granted permits to foreign fishing fleets to operate within their exclusive economic zones. Another briefing paper notes that in return for aid money, Japan bribed several poor nations in 2001 to buy support for its stance on whaling at the International Whaling Commission."604,Cape Times (South Africa),2/12/2008,Mbeki 'knew about Selebi corruption case',e2 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (94%),NEWS; Pg. 1,CT,Newspaper,Karyn Maughan,ENGLISH,343 words,,12-Feb-08,,CORRUPTION (91%); SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); POLICE FORCES (90%); MISCONDUCT (78%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (78%); SEARCH & SEIZURE (77%); WITNESSES (77%); CORRECTIONS WORKERS (72%); NATIONAL SECURITY (72%); PRISONS (71%); CORRECTIONS (71%); DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS (71%),"JOHANNESBURG: Ten meetings with prosecuting boss Vusi Pikoli - as well as a ""top secret"" letter - did nothing to convince President Thabo Mbeki there was a corruption case against National Police Commissioner Jackie Selebi. In an explosive affidavit filed yesterday, acting prosecuting head Mokotedi Mpshe has also revealed that Pikoli informed six top government officials, including Justice Minister Brigitte Mabandla, Safety and Security Minister Charles Nqakula and Defence Minister Mosuioa Lekota, of the ""serious"" graft claims against Selebi. Mpshe's statements that there was ""constant communication"" between Pikoli, Mbeki and Mabandla about the Selebi investigation could cast serious doubts on Mbeki's claims that he was ignorant of any alleged wrongdoing by Selebi. Earlier this year, Mbeki told the media: ""I have said this before, many times, that if there was anybody with information that shows National Commissioner Selebi has done wrong things, I would act on it. ""Nobody did, nobody came to me."" Mpshe has, however, stated under oath that: ""The president himself has been kept fully informed of both the fact of the investigation against Selebi and the nature of the allegations against him ... there was indeed information and evidence communicated to (Mabandla) and the president."" He went on to state that Selebi's claim that ""advocate Pikoli had simply informed the president of Selebi's alleged involvement in organised crime but failed to provide him with detail of such alleged misconduct is ... not correct"". In a direct challenge to Selebi, Mpshe also invited the police commissioner to explain how he obtained a draft copy of Pikoli's ""top secret"" May 7, 2007 letter to Mbeki, in which he asked the president to persuade the police to allow the Scorpions to carry out search and seizure operations at police headquarters and at Selebi's home. Mpshe's affidavit has also exposed how Pikoli's two-dozen ""Selebi"" meetings with government bosses, which included Correctional Services Minister Ngconde Balfour, were met with less than enthusiasm."606,Cape Times (South Africa),2/13/2008,Former ambassador named in Zuma corruption case,e2 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (94%),NEWS; Pg. 1,CT,Newspaper,Karyn Maughan,ENGLISH,263 words,,13-Feb-08,,CORRUPTION (91%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%); INTERVIEWS (78%); MONEY LAUNDERING (73%); FORENSICS (72%); COMPANY STRUCTURES & OWNERSHIP (72%); WITNESSES (71%); POLICE FORCES (71%); DEFENSE CONTRACTING (64%),"JOHANNESBURG: Papers filed by the Scorpions in support of fraud and corruption charges against Jacob Zuma name former ambassador to Paris Barbara Masekela as having received money from Jurgen Kí_gl, the businessman they suspect laundered R500 000 alleged to have been paid to the ANC leader by an arms company. Kí_gl is also listed as a state witness in the Scorpions' case against police chief Jackie Selebi. Scorpions boss Leonard McCarthy alleged that payments had been made to Zuma by Cay Nominees, a company owned by Kí_gl. He said there were ""indications"" that the payments might be linked to the arms company Thompson-CSF and the undertaking that investigators alleged it made to pay Zuma R500 000 a year in return for protection in the arms deal probe. Details of the payments made by Kí_gl and his companies are listed in a KPMG draft report, ""The State vs Jacob Zuma and others: forensic investigation"", dated September 2, 2006. The report says that Kí_gl managed funds on behalf of a number of ""government officials and/or politicians"", including Masekela. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Masekela said then-deputy president Thabo Mbeki had met Thompson-CSF representatives on December 17, 1998. Mbeki, who was then chairing the interdepartmental committee overseeing the arms deal, has said he cannot recall such a meeting. Masekela told the paper she had arranged a ""courtesy call"" meeting between Mbeki and Thompson-CSF. It took place a year before Thompson was awarded an arms contract.

Those remaining claims are unlikely to all be dealt with before the deadline set for the end of this year, provincial land claims commissioner Beverly Jansen said. Included in the unsettled claims are Ndabeni, where controversy and allegations of corruption continue to bedevil restitution, and District Six, where the city council and the District Six Beneficiary Development Trust are embroiled in a legal battle. The latter claim is expected to progress following the formation of a task team that includes national and provincial government officials, the national lands claims commissioner and the city. ""Remaining claims are most difficult because they are affected by conflict - whether in a community or in families. The original deadline to complete restitution was 2005 and has since been changed to 2008. ""Many people are concerned about it, but we won't leave any claims unsettled (just) because we are driven by a deadline,"" Jansen said, adding that it was Parliament's prerogative to extend the deadline. She said the availability of land was proving to be the biggest hurdle, as municipalities and government departments had their own priorities for use of land they owned. ""We know land is scarce and expensive, but we are entirely dependent on municipalities and government departments that own land. ""We tell departments that they've got land of the dispossessed and we want it back. ""The matter is then negotiated and in some cases we've been working with municipalities for more than two years. ""Many claimants do not understand that it can take so long. There are legalities to be followed before land can be disposed of,"" explained Jansen. While the District Six trust had a successful annual meeting yesterday, the police commercial branch was still investigating corruption complaints in the Ndabeni land claim and has approached the state for a decision to prosecute. The trust told 500 people at yesterday's meeting that the city council owned District Six land, accessing it was out of the trust's hands and the task team would deal with the issue. Chairperson Anwah Nagia said the trust's mission was to get people home. ""Soon we will be discussing the next step to build 4 000 houses. Claims involve not only owners and tenants, but also mosques and churches. Don't give up now,"" he said. Many praised trustees for their efforts, but individuals in the audience criticised the trust and accused it of not representing them. Amendments to the trust deed and eight additional trust members were accepted unanimously. Asked how her office had dealt with the Ndabeni matter, Jansen said: ""There are different groups claiming to be the rightful representatives and there has been constant conflict and one group accused another of fraud."" ""It has been alleged that one of the groups had already sold a portion of the land to a developer. My job is to protect the claimants because that is state land."" She said there were moves to arbitrate the Ndabeni dispute. If all parties did not accept the outcome, her office would ask the courts to decide who the rightful representatives were."609,Cape Times (South Africa),4/25/2008,Corruption and governance issues problematic,e2 Edition,ZIMBABWE (96%); AFRICA (93%); KENYA (92%); SOUTH AFRICA (79%),NEWS; Pg. 5,CT,Newspaper,AZIZ HARTLEY and SAPA,ENGLISH,662 words,UNITED NATIONS (55%),24-Apr-08,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE (79%); CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA (79%); LONDON, ENGLAND (52%)",ELECTIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); EMBARGOES & SANCTIONS (89%); ARMS EMBARGOES (89%); ARMS TRADE (87%); NOBEL PRIZES (78%); RELIGION (78%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (78%); HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS (78%); HUMAN RIGHTS (72%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (70%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (67%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (65%),"IN ADDITION to urging African leaders to ask Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe to step down, Nobel peace laureate Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu says many of SA's current problems stem from questionable governance and burgeoning corruption. Tutu said that the aftermath of elections in Kenya and Zimbabwe showed what happened when incumbents refused to concede defeat and were prepared to cause destruction in their own countries. ""All of this just to satisfy their power-hungry egos,"" he said yesterday when he addressed the Stellenbosch University's seboka (Sotho for getting together on common issues) on higher education and ethical leadership. ""I'm calling on African leaders to persuade Mr Mugabe to step down and say to him that he does still have the chance of redeeming, of salvaging some of his legacy and could be provided with a soft landing. If he continues and remains as obdurate as he appears to be, then clearly people are going to be saying 'no, he must ultimately be arraigned for all of the human rights violations he has perpetrated',"" Tutu said. Tutu also called for an arms embargo on Zimbabwe in order to avert the escalation of violence in the troubled nation. He appealed to world leaders to use the United Nations to stop the supply of weapons to Zimbabwe, which is currently in a political crisis following last month's disputed elections. ""I join the worldwide calls to stop the supply of weapons to the country - by land, sea or air - until the political crisis is resolved,"" the former archbishop of Cape Town said. Tutu said the UN should agree on a binding arms embargo on Zimbabwe after a Chinese-owned ship was forced to abandon a planned delivery of weapons to the Harare regime. ""It is obvious that supplying large quantities of arms at this stage would risk escalating the violence, perhaps resulting in the large-scale loss of life,"" said Tutu. But, speaking in London, ANC president Jacob Zuma said yesterday it was not yet the time to impose an arms embargo on Zimbabwe in the wake of its undecided presidential election. Zuma said dockers in Durban had ""correctly"" refused to unload the weapons destined for Zimbabwe. ""That was a very appropriate response,"" Zuma said, but added he would not currently support any moves for an arms embargo against the country. Turning to SA, Tutu said given the events before and after the ANC conference in Polokwane, many people wondered what a good leader was. Tutu saluted former SA president Nelson Mandela's leadership which had former oppressors and their victims participate in reconciliation. ""We entered into striving to be non-racial and non-sexist with some gusto. It is less so now. We are fractious, our morale has taken some body blows. We are apprehensive, we don't hold up our heads quite as we used to. We have been buffeted by odd policies on the devastating HIV/Aids pandemic; we have been deeply distressed by our positions on Zimbabwe, on Burma, on cluster bombs,"" he said. SA's challenges included poverty, housing, education, crime and unemployment yet: ""A huge part of our problem stems from questionable governance. We're seeing a burgeoning in corruption, of many engaging in self-enrichment sprees whilst the gap between the rich and the poor widens so that we are sitting on a powder keg - a deeply worrying, volatile situation waiting to be ignited,"" he said. Tutu criticised the treatment given to MPs involved in the Travelgate scandal and said public confidence in state institutions had also been eroded amid suspicions of the arms deal and the intended shutdown of the Scorpions. Asked for his impression of Tutu's address, former chief justice Arthur Chaskalson said: ""I thought it was an extra-ordinarily powerful speech with the warmth and humour one associates with him and the depth of his vision. It was a wonderful presentation which very importantly was drawing our attention to some of the issues that are of fundamental importance to our country."" aziz.hartley@inl.co.za"610,Cape Times (South Africa),5/1/2008,MPs lock horns with Home Affairs DG over corruption allegations,e1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (94%),NEWS; Pg. 4,CT,Newspaper,BABALO NDENZE,ENGLISH,463 words,,30-Apr-08,,TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); EVIDENCE (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (77%); SPONSORSHIP (68%); WRITERS (60%); SMART CARDS (53%),"IT WAS a tense encounter yesterday when straight-talking Home Affairs director-general Mavuso Msimang and members of the National Assembly's home affairs portfolio committee locked horns over allegations that members of the committee were ""colluding"" with suspended department officials accused of corruption. The Speaker has now been asked to intervene. Msimang stuck to his guns when he faced MPs who summoned him to appear before the National Assembly's home affairs committee to provide evidence to support the |allegations. During yesterday's meeting, Msimang also repeated what he said at a previous committee meeting - that a visit to a German company in June last year by the committee had the potential to compromise tender procedures. The visit was partly sponsored by MAN Ferrostaal, a company with an interest in the smart-card technology for which Home Affairs will soon invite tenders. Msimang said the department's legal team conducting the disciplinary hearings had evidence but said he wasn't aware that he had to bring physical evidence to the meeting and therefore he couldn't substantiate the allegations. Had he known that the meeting would have been ""so legalistic"" and complicated, he would have brought his own legal team. The committee eventually resolved to refer the matter |to the Speaker of the National Assembly for further |investigation. On the alleged collusion between MPs and suspended officials, Msimang said there were glaring similarities between a statement made by ANC MP Kgoloko Morwamoche and evidence given by one of the suspended officials during hearings. Msimang said Morwamoche's comment that the department was removing the officials ""so corruption can continue"", was ""tantamount to defamation"". ""I would think the committee would be worried about this (corruption). It's a matter that should interest the committee. I would think that bothers you. ""The efforts expressed here seem to be extremely hostile,"" said Msimang. He said the similarities between what Morwamoche said and what the suspended official said were ""too much of a coincidence"". ""There is a direct link in the position taken by the member and the suspended official,"" said Msimang. The DG also mentioned how shocked he was when at a previous home affairs committee meeting, he received a scribbled note stating that the department ""has absolutely no chance of winning its case against one of its suspended employees"". Msimang said the author of the note ""was none other than (ANC MP Patrick Chauke)"". He called on Chauke to explain what he had meant by the note. But Chauke refused to confirm that he had written the note. Chauke then reminded Msimang that he was not the equal of MPs and accused him of attempting to avoid being accountable to the committee. babalo.ndenze@inl.co.za"611,Cape Times (South Africa),5/9/2008,'Corruption keeps oil wealth from the people',e2 Edition,EGYPT (94%); AFRICA (93%); LIBYA (92%); ETHIOPIA (79%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%),NEWS; Pg. 2,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,178 words,AFRICAN UNION (58%); UNITED NATIONS (55%),9-May-08,,CORRUPTION (90%); ELECTIONS (78%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (78%); LIVING STANDARDS (72%); ELECTION AUTHORITIES (69%); CHILDREN (67%),"Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi accused a ""corrupt"" government of failing to manage the country's oil wealth and ordered it to hand out oil money directly to the country's 5 million people - to improve their living standard using soaring oil revenues.

Last week, the taxi industry called for an urgent conference after the removal of Peters. Peters was expelled by the SA National Taxi Council (Santaco) for failing to fulfil his national duties as chairman of the Western Cape council.

Rasool praised public servants for enduring severe pressure in their daily work and for their service to the public. The celebrations also presented them with an opportunity to reflect on their tasks and to measure the expectations of the service, he said. Rasool said that with a few exceptions, African countries had prospered over the past 10 years; their average economic growth stood at 5% and that all this was thanks to the hard work of people in the public service. ""Elements of non-democracy are eliminated all the time. Some resist democracy because they want to rule on and on, but those are the dying kicks because they know their time has come,"" Rasool said. He condemned the recent xenophobic attacks as un-African and said it came as a huge shock, given that South Africa was behind the notion of the African Renaissance. ""But if that was the negative, then the positive was that South Africa's public service, together with NGOs and churches and other people rallied to this tragedy and disaster to give of themselves, to give their time, sacrificing their comfort, to rise to the challenge as the police did.

He praised civil servants for the work they did and said they should regard their roles as important, irrespective of the functions they performed. ""Both sides play an important role.

Voting was closer than many predicted, but in the end Motshekga triumphed over outgoing league secretary-general Bathabile Dlamini by 295 votes in an overnight ballot at their national conference in Bloemfontein. Motshekga, who also serves on the national executive and national working committees, takes over from Home Affairs Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, who did not stand for re-election.

Three of the four ANC top brass named in the report are foes of Eastern Cape Premier Nosimo Balindlela, who meanwhile is poised to be axed from her post at the behest of the ANC's national executive committee (NEC). The report, compiled by a commission headed by Judge Ronnie Pillay, reportedly implicates the former chief executive officer of the Eastern Cape Development Corporation, Mcebisi Jonas; Sports Minister Makhenkesi Stofile, who is also a former Eastern Cape premier; Eastern Cape ANC chairperson Stone Sizani; and ANC NEC member and former economic development MEC Enoch Godongwana in multimillion rand irregularities. They demanded a retraction of the allegations by noon yesterday, pointing out they had not been afforded an opportunity to answer the accusations, but this deadline passed without a word from Pillay. ""It (the report) was an attempt to sustain a particular image of certain individuals and deal with them politically and it's really sad,"" Jonas said yesterday. He said it was very suspicious that the report was leaked at the time that there was tremendous upheaval taking place within ANC structures in the Eastern Cape. The report was ""leaked"" on the eve of last weekend's critical NEC meeting that mooted getting rid of Balindlela, who is a staunch ally of President Thabo Mbeki and is blamed for failing to come to grips with chronic problems of maladministration in the impoverished province. Sizani, too, backed Mbeki, but is understood to have mended fences with the so-called Zuma camp in the region during the past few months. Ironically, Jonas is tipped as a possible future premier of the province and while some view Godongwana as a contender to take over from Balindlela, he is thought likely to be destined for a national Cabinet post after next year's elections. The men's legal representative, Lister Nuku, confirmed yesterday that Pillay had not retracted the allegations contained in the report. He earlier threatened to launch an urgent court application for ""appropriate declaratory relief"" and punitive costs if the allegations were not withdrawn. Pillay himself declined to comment on the matter, stating that the report was there ""for everybody to see"". The Daily Dispatch newspaper, meanwhile, quoted presidential spokesperson Mukoni Ratshitanga as saying the premier had to refer such allegations to a law enforcement agency that could then decide about the ""admissibility and veracity of information contained in the report"". The Pillay report, which contained extracts from an earlier investigation by the Auditor General's office, found that loans were granted by the Eastern Cape Development Corporation ""without adhering to the prescribed policies"". The report also noted that outstanding balances on these loans were written off.

Ramatlhodi, a member of the ANC's national executive committee, earlier applied to the Pretoria High Court for the second time to be admitted as an advocate. His first bid was in 2004 when it was rumoured that he was due to take over from the then prosecutions head, Bulelani Ngcuka. A corruption probe involving Ramatlhodi had already been ongoing for a few years. In 2004, Judge Hekkie Daniels postponed Ramatlhodi's application to be admitted as an advocate indefinitely and ordered that the matter may not be enrolled for hearing until such time as the probe involving him (Ramatlhodi) had been disposed of. Now, nearly four years down the line, Ramatlhodi has once again turned to the court in a bid to be admitted as an advocate. This time however, the Pretoria Society of Advocates asked the court for leave to intervene, stating in an affidavit before court that ""from enquiries made to the office of the National Prosecuting Authority, a decision has been made to proffer criminal charges against the applicant (Ramatlhodi)."" Ramatlhodi's application earlier this month was removed from the roll by Judge Dion Basson but he can still enroll the matter at a later stage. In his latest application, Ramatlhodi had cited the Directorate of Special Operations as an interested party. In an affidavit signed by him in September this year, Ramatlhodi denied any wrong doing.

Worse in the sense that public-sector corruption has taken its toll on public trust and better in that political leaders come to realise their achievements are short-lived if the citizens do not trust their institutions and elected leaders. This possibly explains why the ANC has re-opened the debate on corruption in the public sector before a crucial national election. And a good thing, too, since the need for a renewed focus on ethics in public life is vital to any maturing democracy. Serving the public interest is fundamental to public office. Public officials are always required to assess whether they are in a situation where their private interests might improperly influence the way they perform their job. And public trust is often said to be the cornerstone of good governance. Certain conditions provide an enabling environment for conflicts of interest situations and corruption to transpire. The conflation of party and state provides numerous opportunities for elected and unelected officials to take advantage of their public positions for personal benefit. Black economic empowerment (BEE), designed to promote black ownership of the economy, while relevant and necessary, has also been criticised for its unintended consequences. These being nepotism, cronyism and the creation of a small but wealthy politically connected empowerment elite. The ruling ANC stands accused by opposition parties, but also by its tripartite alliance partners, of allowing members to use the party as a means to business success. In addition, despite their public positions, many elected and non-elected officials possess private business interests in the form of shares, directorships and partnerships. In a 2006 report, the auditor-general found significant overlap between public life and private business interests, with six out of 10 civil servants holding private business interests in South Africa. These situations create huge potential for conflicts of interest. When public officials are distracted from their jobs and the greater public interest, or corrupted by their private interests, resources are diverted away from service delivery, with the poorest and most marginalised citizens in our society bearing the consequences. South Africa's politicians unwittingly contribute to their own demise and that of their institutions and the public good when they refuse to regulate their own behaviour. If citizens believe that their elected officials fail to act for the public good, or that they misuse their office to benefit themselves, the public trust vital to the wellbeing of institutions is eroded. Without strong motivation for self-regulation, there is a greater need to tighten regulations. And in this regard, there is reason to be cheerful if one looks to the recent commitments made towards cleaning up public office. The Public Service Commission has drafted new regulations that will deal with bribes and kickbacks in the public service to ensure that tendering processes become more transparent. Legislation to regulate the conflicts of interest of judges was passed last year and should be implemented soon. And, in a revealing moment, the ANC president, Jacob Zuma, recently placed corruption at centre stage at the ANC 2009 manifesto launch in the Eastern Cape when he promised to run a graft-free government and root out corruption within party and government. He circuitously questioned the party's deployment practice, which places loyal members in key public sector positions, stating that public servants should rather be in the correct positions and that we should not deploy our friends. The ruling party's manifesto is somewhat thin on the fight against corruption but does promise new measures to prevent procurement and tendering corruption. But are all these pre-election promises sufficient? Widening the scope of regulations and introducing harsher penalties for breaches is only part of the solution. Regulations and penalties are important because they act as deterrents and, importantly, they help to guide the behaviour of public officials to make the right choices. However, a less tangible factor crucial to realising cleaner government involves self-regulation. The success of our democratic institutions in meeting their obligations to citizens depends in part on a dedicated and incorruptible team of public officials who embrace the spirit of public service. This involves placing the public interest before narrow self-interests, regulating one's behaviour and removing oneself from conflict of interest situations as they arise. South Africa's codes of conduct that establish and inform ethics in public life focus largely on compliance to a set of rules and limitations, such as the disclosure of financial interests. Yet this ""top-down"", compliance-based approach places little emphasis on the over-arching values that ought to guide the behaviour of people in public positions. If public officials do not own these values they come to view conflicts of interest regulations, like asset disclosure, as an imposition on their individual freedoms, or simply as cumbersome bureaucratic necessities of public life. Instead, a values-based approach can play an important role in the moral life of institutions by laying the foundations for ethical conduct and informing members of the rationale for such behaviour. In South Africa, the compliance-based approach has constituted the first step towards deepening ethics in public life. And, to a large extent, it has been successful in its implementation. However, as democratic institutions mature it becomes increasingly important that broad consensus about societal values is reached - especially with respect to our expectations of people in public positions. Without consensus as to what constitutes principled and ethical behaviour, there is little to guide public officials. However, when a core set of values is established, these questions are more easily addressed, and a suitable pattern of behaviour becomes entrenched. l Schulz-Herzenberg is a senior researcher on the Conflicts of Interest Project at the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) Corruption and Governance Programme in Cape Town."632,Cape Times (South Africa),2/4/2009,"rules favour informalisation, corruption",e1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (99%); SOUTHERN AFRICA (79%); AFRICA (79%),NEWS; Pg. 6,CT,Newspaper,CHRISTINA TAYLOR,ENGLISH,527 words,UNITED NATIONS (58%),3-Feb-09,,IMMIGRATION (92%); CORRUPTION (90%); WAGES & SALARIES (90%); EMPLOYMENT (90%); PASSPORTS & VISAS (78%); REFUGEES (78%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (77%); PUBLIC POLICY (76%); UNEMPLOYMENT RATES (75%); ECONOMIC NEWS (75%); LABOR SHORTAGES (73%); UNEMPLOYED PERSONS (73%); MINIMUM WAGE (72%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (72%); CITY GOVERNMENT (72%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (72%); LICENSES & PERMITS (70%); NURSES & NURSING (64%); CITIES (61%),"SOUTH AFRICA can gain from offering more resources and legitimacy to immigrants, academics suggest, but the country's citizens meanwhile suffer from restrictions on the rights of foreign nationals. According to a draft submission by the Forced Migration Studies Programme at Wits University to the United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Report 2009, South Africa's immigration policy should be revised if the country is to maximise the benefit of having migrants. According to Loren Landau, director of the Wits programme and one of the paper's co-authors, migrants could uplift the South African economy if they were permitted to develop and use their skills. While immigration generally helped development, keeping migrants illegal, he said, ""has harmed the country in a number of ways"". For example, the paper reported, ""Many foreign citizens without the right to work - but with the skills and willingness to do so - accept positions where they are paid below the minimum wage |or work in inhumane |conditions"". And many with work permits were still turned away from jobs for which they were well-qualified. As a result, current policy was driving processes of ""informalisation and illegality"", including corruption, depression of wages and poor working conditions, which harmed South African workers and undermined unions. Meanwhile, South Africa's shortage of skilled labour could be alleviated by employing qualified immigrants. Landau cited teachers and engineers among those currently forced to work well below their abilities. And, despite South Africa's ""acute"" nursing shortage, ""thousands of refugee nurses remain unemployed because they cannot prove their qualifications"", the paper reported. Scapegoating of foreigners persisted, and risked preventing South Africans from holding government responsible ""for their shortcomings and failed promises"". An exclusionary approach would also limit immigrants' investment in their communities, commitment to improving them, and even civil order. ""People who do not feel welcome in South Africa's urban society are less likely to respect the rules and institutions dedicated to governing it."" Rather, South Africa would benefit from ""an approach that aims to improve the entitlements and capabilities of all residents, regardless of their origin"", which would allow the country to better address the unemployment and inequality it currently faced. Therefore, immigrants should have easier access to documentation and social services, and skilled workers should be fast-tracked for South African certification. Future regulation would also depend on increased co-ordination among government bodies, which currently suffered from ""a paucity of |collaboration"". The paper cited apparent unwillingness on the part of Home Affairs to disclose data on migrants to municipalities, for example, which could hamper city planning efforts. Landau said ultimately, migration policy should recognise the interconnectedness of the entire region's economy. ""Until a line connecting (South Africa and Southern Africa) has been made, South African migration policy is never going to be quite right."" christina.taylor@inl.co.za"633,Cape Times (South Africa),2/11/2009,Spanish opposition party in corruption scandal,e1 Edition,CYPRUS (94%); EUROPE (91%); GERMANY (79%); FRANCE (79%); ISRAEL (79%); TAIWAN (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (71%),NEWS; Pg. 2,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,234 words,HAMAS (57%); UNITED NATIONS (57%); EUROPEAN UNION (55%); EUROPEAN LABORATORY FOR PARTICLE PHYSICS (54%),10-Feb-09,"PARIS, FRANCE (79%); LONDON, ENGLAND (66%)",POLITICAL SCANDALS (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); BRIBERY (90%); INTERROGATION OF SUSPECTS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); SCANDALS (78%); PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (78%); JUDGES (78%); LITIGATION (78%); AGREEMENTS (78%); TAX FRAUD (78%); TAX LAW (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (76%); EUROPEAN UNION (76%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (73%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (73%); MONEY LAUNDERING (73%); COUNTERFEITING (72%); ILLEGAL WEAPONS (71%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (71%); ARMS TRADE (71%); HAMAS (69%); GREENHOUSE GASES (65%); ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (65%); EMISSIONS (51%); PARTICLE ACCELERATORS (50%),"A Spanish judge has named 37 people as suspects in a corruption investigation involving the main opposition Popular Party.

The opposite is the case. It would set an excellent precedent, showing that Zuma placed the interests of his party and his country ahead of his personal ambitions. As it is, it appears almost certain that we are going to have a new head of state who is an accused, facing 16 charges of fraud, corruption, racketeering and money laundering. Israel's departing prime minister, Ehud Olmert, is going for precisely the same reason. He stepped aside from last week's Israeli election because he is to be indicted for illegally accepting ""cash envelopes"" from a New York businessman while he was mayor of Jerusalem. Like Zuma, Olmert insists he is innocent, but he says he is ""proud to be a citizen of a country where the prime minister can be investigated like any other citizen"". There's no hint of a bad precedent in that, no suggestion that anyone is conducting a conspiracy against him or has ""thrown a dark cloud"" at him with the aim of demolishing him, as Zuma has put it. Olmert is simply doing the right thing. The mistake Zuma and the ANC are making is to imagine, as his metaphor suggests, that the case against him is an insubstantial thing, a cloud that will blow over with time. It won't. Scandals don't go away if they are not resolved. They live on and periodically surge back to life as new bits of evidence are unearthed. As long as there is an unfinished story, there will be people who will keep digging and who will keep on exposing, so that the scandal will keep on suppurating and poisoning all around it. Even if Zuma and his supporters succeed in getting rid of the prosecutors in this case and installing a tame successor to Vusi Pikoli who will dutifully drop the charges against Zuma, it still won't go away. In Judge Chris Nicholson's wise words in his otherwise flawed judgment, if no proper investigation is held into the arms deal, ""a cloud of scandal and suspicion"" will remain. Just think on this: wherever Zuma goes, as president of South Africa, he will be unable to protect himself against accusations that he is a corrupt leader. Because he will not be able to bring a legal claim of libel or slander against any accuser, for to do so would involve having to go to court to testify and face cross-examination on the subject - which is precisely what Zuma has fought so long and so hard to avoid. Such an inability to defend one's integrity will surely be a most uncomfortable position for any head of state to be in as he travels. Many arguments are being advanced by Zuma's supporters to justify scrapping the charges against him. One is that the returning ANC exiles found themselves in dire financial circumstances, with no jobs and no homes to come back to, and that they had no choice but to seek help from business tycoons who were only too ready to ingratiate themselves with people they knew would soon be governing the country. This is certainly true, and no doubt many did seek and receive such help. One can also sympathise particularly with the position Zuma found himself in, with his multiple wives and many children and the fact that he was initially deployed to the provincial legislature of KwaZulu-Natal, at a lower salary than MPs received, so that he could help negotiate an end to the terrible political warfare raging there. But there is a critical difference between accepting such financial aid and misusing one's political position to secure contractual advantages for one's benefactors, which is what Zuma is accused of having done. Then again, it is said that Zuma was ""small fry"" in the arms deal compared with others who have not been charged. Maybe, but then the fault lies in the failure to pursue the other, bigger fish, not in the fact that Zuma and Schabir Shaik have been charged. It is also pertinent to ask, how small is small in this sprawling affair? Zuma is charged with having received 783 payments from Shaik totalling R4 072 499.85 between October 25, 1995, and July 1, 2005. The payments are itemised in the indictment in a 17-page ""schedule of |benefits"". As Paul Holden puts it in his excellent little pocketbook on the arms deal, if that schedule is ever presented in court and proved valid, it will indicate that Shaik was supporting Zuma's business affairs and lifestyle for almost a full decade, even after Zuma became deputy president with a substantial salary and for a full month after Shaik himself had been found guilty by Judge Hilary Squires. As Squires put it in his judgment, the two were functioning in a state of ""mutually beneficial symbiosis"". And the deals involved were certainly not small fry. The contract for the combat suites for the German corvettes cost us taxpayers R6.2 billion, and the asset forfeiture of R34 million provides a yardstick for the profits Shaik got out of the deals. Which of course is why he was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. Another suggestion is that the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) should suspend charges against Zuma on the specific condition that the government institutes a full commission of inquiry into the arms deal immediately after assuming office after the election. It's an interesting suggestion, but there is one problem: the arms deal itself covers only about one-quarter of the charges against Zuma. The rest relate to other alleged deals in his 10-year relationship with Shaik. Willem Heath has published an article urging the NPA to ask itself whether it is in the public interest to continue with the prosecution of Zuma. Given that the country is in a state of transition and facing serious challenges, he clearly thinks it is not. A more objective question might be to ask whether it is in the public interest for someone facing such serious criminal charges to become president of the country in the first place. Particularly since there is a perfectly capable incumbent. l Sparks is a veteran journalist and political commentator."635,Cape Times (South Africa),2/18/2009,it's time to put the focus back on tackling corruption,e1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (92%),NEWS; Pg. 9,CT,Newspaper,Chartey Quarcoo,ENGLISH,1429 words,,19-Feb-09,,CORRUPTION (91%); LEGISLATION (90%); POLITICS (90%); POLICE FORCES (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (77%); INVESTIGATIONS (74%); SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES (72%); POLITICAL PARTIES (72%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (72%); POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS (71%),"The ink has barely dried on the legislation President Kgalema Motlanthe signed into law last month providing for the dissolution of the National Prosecuting Authority's Directorate of Special Operations (DSO), or Scorpions, and the establishment of a new anti-corruption unit within the South African Police Service (SAPS). Yet, as the nation's political parties unfurl their election manifestos and rally their bases, the DSO remains the focus of passionate, at times vituperative, debate on the boundaries of prosecutorial authority in the fight against public corruption. Opposition parties continue to accuse the ANC of dismantling the DSO to subvert investigations of corruption within the party's ranks, and have pledged to reinstate the unit if elected. The ANC, in kind, has reiterated its assertion that the DSO vindictively targeted ANC members, overstepped its mandate and used media leaks to tarnish the party's highest officials. In the wake of legislation terminating the unit, many questions remain, not the least of which concern the fate of its ongoing action against suspended national Police Commissioner Jackie Selebi. Yet while new challenges loom, the political discourse on the fate of the DSO appears trapped in stasis, locked in a debate over what the unit ""was"" without concomitant focus on the institution set to replace it - the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI). Throughout this election season, the parties have variously assailed phantom versions of the DSO and DPCI - the former ""unbridled"" in its attack on the ANC, the latter ""neutered"" by its subservience to the SAPS - without crediting the changes incorporated into the bills during the legislative process, or conversely, the concerns they still fail to rectify. This may prove costly. Instead of laying the foundations for an anti-corruption regime capable of securing broad public support, this divisive discourse undermines the potential of any subsequent model (including a reincarnated DSO) to secure the public buy-in it may need to succeed. In truth, the legislation signed by Motlanthe includes safeguards absent from its first draft, yet insufficient to ameliorate concerns that it undermines the independence of the nation's anti-corruption bodies. This acknowledgment lacks the impact of competing pronouncements that the disbandment, or continued existence, of the DSO will precipitate a crisis, yet warrants recognition in any evaluation of the new unit's prospects for success. The overarching argument against the bills when they were introduced in May 2008 - that disbanding the DSO and reconstituting it under the SAPS would disrupt the prosecution-led ""troika model"" credited for the unit's success and usurp its institutional independence - remains cogent. Yet many of the supporting arguments proffered as evidence of the DPCI's inadequate design no longer apply. Those arguments rested on the contention that the bills concentrated undue authority in the national commissioner of police - an office called into doubt, if not disrepute, by the DSO's corruption charges against Selebi. In its initial form, the SAPS Amendment Bill empowered the national commissioner to appoint the head of the directorate, relegated that head to a lower rank than his DSO predecessor and eliminated the unit's authority to initiate investigations without a referral from the national commissioner. None of those provisions survived intact. The final legislation provided that the minister of safety and security, not the national commissioner, shall appoint the head of the directorate, elevated his rank to deputy national commissioner, and authorised him to initiate investigations without awaiting a referral. Taking cues from the Khampepe Commission, which sharply criticised the ministerial co-ordinating committee's efforts to facilitate the unit's co-operation with other law enforcement bodies, legislators also provided for a joint operational committee to monitor the unit's secondment of outside officers, and a retired judge to review complaints. Notwithstanding these changes, concerns regarding the new unit's independence and insulation from executive pressure persist. First, as deputy national commissioner, the head of the DPCI remains answerable to the national commissioner of police. The national commissioner, in turn, enjoys less protection against presidential removal than the national director of public prosecutions (NDPP), rendering him - and his selection for DPCI head - more vulnerable to executive pressure than his National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) counterpart. Second, under the new legislation, the national commissioner will function as the DPCI's accounting officer, thereby retaining control of the unit's finances and further circumscribing its independence. Third, public sparring between the DSO and SAPS over their respective mandates - and more recently, over the execution of subpoenas against the police in the Selebi investigation - renews concerns over the practical restraints prosecutors seconded to the new unit will face. The new legislation requires the NDPP to maintain a ""dedicated component of prosecutors"" to assist the DPCI in its investigations. It prohibits these ""investigative"" prosecutors, however, from participating in the subsequent prosecution of their targets. Whether this bifurcation of duties will relieve the turf wars between the SAPS and the NPA or merely restrict prosecutors' capacity to pursue public corruption without fear or favour remains to be seen. These are valid concerns. The problem is that rather than address them in a manner that acknowledges the bills' moderate improvements and existing shortcomings, the parties regress too easily into a debate over the fallibility of the DSO, or the forces that brought it down. This may not surprise; critics are loathe to cede credibility to the process that begot the bills, and proponents may fear that acknowledging the virtues of the DSO's independence will lend legitimacy to its pursuit of Selebi and Jacob Zuma. Neither does pre-election rhetoric generally err towards nuance. Nevertheless, the current discourse debilitates either unit's post-election sustainability by framing the debate in terms that predispose the ""losing"" constituency to deem the surviving body illegitimate. Each side's focus on curtailing the sins of the other tends to blur the distinction between the structural weaknesses of South Africa's anti-corruption framework and the failures of those individuals charged with implementing it. While the two certainly bear some relation (as inadequate safeguards foster conditions ripe for abuse by corrupt individuals), sustainable reforms must be designed to outlive any one set of ""bad apples"", a point often lost in the flurry of cross-accusations over corrupt police chiefs and overzealous prosecutors. More troubling still, the current discourse does not simply reinforce public divisions over the criminal justice sector; it appears to deepen them. Though ostensibly voicing structural concerns, the parties' words demarcate more contentious fault lines - the DSO vs ANC, the NPA vs SAPS - that leave increasingly little room for common ground. Those who support the DSO harbour a racist agenda; those who support the DPCI condone ""crony politics"", and ""success"" requires one side to vanquish the other. This cannot serve the country's anti-corruption interests. That conflicting views of the nation's law enforcement bodies will persist goes without saying. Yet debating the country's anti-corruption unit in terms that necessarily diminish, rather than develop, our mutual investment in its success does that unit a disservice. In the name of building public trust and legitimacy, it renders both more elusive. If the new administration, to be elected in April, is genuine about building a system of national integrity that tackles corruption in the public and private sector, then it has to prioritise the strengthening of the new anti-corruption body. This has to happen away from the electioneering and focus on individual politicians which clouded the debate on the dissolution of the DSO. Rather, it requires a renewed effort by the ministries of Justice and Safety and Security to recommit to integrity and build support for the DPCI by both directly engaging the concerns of its critics and supporting the institution in its investigation of corrupt elites. l Quarcoo is a research volunteer in the Corruption and Governance Programme, Institute of Security Studies, Cape Town, and a Harvard University Sheldon Fellow."637,Cape Times (South Africa),2/27/2009,I have a feeling corruption in football goes right to the top,e1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (92%); ITALY (79%),SPORT; Pg. 22,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,695 words,,27-Feb-09,,SOCCER (91%); SCANDALS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); SPORTS OFFICIATING (90%); SPORTS TAMPERING (78%); SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (77%); FINES & PENALTIES (75%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (74%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (73%); TOURNAMENTS (71%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (57%),"IN 2006 the football world was rocked by the Italian football scandal, which involved some of the country's top professional clubs. The scandal was uncovered in May 2006 when Italian police implicated then-league champions Juventus, AC Milan, Fiorentina and Lazio after a network was detected that showed corrupt relations between team managers and referee organisations. The clubs were accused of rigging games by selecting favourable referees for their matches. Juventus were stripped of their title and were demoted from the Serie A and the other clubs were fined and points were deducted in the outcome. AC Milan were banned from playing in the Champions League, but won an appeal and consequently went on to win the tournament by beating Liverpool in the final. Not so long ago South African football was rocked to the core by Operation Dribble. More than 40 people ranging from referees, linesmen, club owners and match commissioners were initially arrested. But, unlike than in Italy, only a couple of scoundrels were convicted - relatively small fry compared to some of the people who were investigated by police. It left everybody wondering what happened. Was this the only outcome of the scandal? Last week, two of South Africa's top referees, Jonas Nhlapo and Peter Mabuza, had polygraph tests. Mabuza passed his test, but Nhlapo failed and was subsequently suspended after failing to appear before a Safa hearing to explain the irregularities in his test. I believe a sane man with nothing to hide would have appeared at the hearing to explain himself. I am not an expert in the art of the polygraph test, but from what I have heard it could also respond negatively to nervousness. But Nhlapo never pitched to explain and something smells very fishy. Although the standard of refereeing has improved over the last couple of seasons, it was shocking in the past. But now, seemingly, with more games on television then ever before, the standard has improved immensely. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying everybody cheated when there were no television cameras around. On the contrary, I think the standard of refereeing has improved because of the hard work put in by Safa and its referee body. However, where there is smoke, there normally is fire. And in Nhlapo's case, it looks like something is about to explode and this might be the platform for the PSL, Safa and the police to redeem themselves after the horrendous mess they made of Operation Dribble. I have a feeling the corruption (and I believe there is) in our football probably goes right to the very top. And I have a feeling that the police know it too. I have a feeling Safa might be shell-shocked by Nhlapo's failed test. They have only said he is suspended because he didn't pitch for the hearing and I don't think they know the way forward. But I can show you the way ladies and gentlemen: time for another full-scale investigation into corruption in football. It's time to take the bull by the horns, forget about who you are investigating and throw the book at them. I have a feeling the outcome could be very big and could tarnish our already fragile reputation before next year's World Cup tournament. And that's maybe why they are stalling. Imagine if a scandal brings our football to its knees weeks before the opening game of the biggest sporting showpiece in the world. But the truth will have to come out somewhere, somehow; otherwise nobody will take this league seriously anymore and we will destroy everything that is good about it. hhhhh Meanwhile, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur square up in one of the most low-key League Cup finals for some time. With the league being so tight at the bottom, everybody, including Spurs, are focusing all their energy on the job of surviving. The high-profile Champions League fixtures earlier this week also took some of the gloss off the final. But Spurs, who beat Chelsea in last year's final, will be up for this game because a spot in the Uefa Cup is up for grabs. They won't qualify for Europe next season by ending high up on the log, so all they have to do is beat United. So I'm going with Spurs to surprise United on Sunday! john.goliath@inl.co.za"638,Cape Times (South Africa),3/2/2009,"Fighting corruption to be a priority at all levels for ANC, Zuma tells rally",e2 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (79%),NEWS; Pg. 5,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,360 words,,1-Mar-09,,ELECTIONS (89%); VOTERS & VOTING (87%); CORRUPTION (74%),"seizure at the rally and was also treated at the hospital, Maxon said.

Yesterday, officers from the unit, meant to replace the Scorpions, arrested a senior official at the troubled Department of Home Affairs refugee centre in Airport Industria. The arrest was meant to happen amid much publicity as the media, invited by the Hawks, streamed to the centre to witness the arrest. But instead, the suspect was driven out of the centre in an unmarked vehicle with blacked-out windows, foregoing the ""perp (as in perpetrator) walk"" made famous by the Scorpions, for which they received much flak. Police did not name her. Spokesman November Filander said the 32-year-old suspect was arrested after an investigation spearheaded by the new head of the Hawks, Anwa Dramat. The official is expected to appear in the Bishop Lavis Magistrate's Court today on fraud and corruption charges for allegedly issuing permits for payment. Filander would, however, not say how much money was involved. Because of the appalling conditions for refugees at the centre, the Cape High Court has ordered it closed by September, following an application by neighbouring businesses. Meanwhile, the Hawks have arrested two senior police detectives on charges of kidnapping, extortion and corruption. Both officers, one arrested on Wednesday evening and the other yesterday, were stationed at the Kuils River police station's detective services. The two are expected to appear in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Monday. Filander said the arrests followed an investigation into the alleged illegal activities of police officers after an incident in which a member of the public advertised his vehicle for sale. He said that corruption within the ranks of the police would not be tolerated and every effort would be made to root out such elements. The Hawks unit was launched at a glitzy function at Midrand's Gallagher Estate on Monday when the head of the Scorpions, Thanda Mngwengwe, symbolically handed over 288 investigations to new boss Dramat. Dramat said at the function that 1 700 officers from the police and the Scorpions had been screened to join his new unit and 1 300 would be screened over 12 months. The unit would have three divisions: organised crime, commercial crime and the hi-tech centre. ""Our resolve is unambiguous: we will leave no stone unturned to bring criminals to book,"" said Dramat. The Hawks's first arrest was just after its launch when it arrested a Durban sangoma and two men who were allegedly planning to rob a jewellery store. Using ""precision"", according to senior police officer Vincent Mdunge, the Hawks arrived at the scene of the crime at 6.30am - even before it could be committed. The three suspects were then arrested.

His movement opposes everything from books to medicine, democracy to capitalism. It wants a more fundamentalist version of sharia in many northern states. But this was nothing to do with al-Qaeda. If you ask why this tiny minority wanted sharia applied more thoroughly, the answer is revealing. It is because the radical social welfare schemes of sharia were not introduced to address dire poverty. Nigeria is one of the richest nations in Africa, as well as one the most populous. But most of that huge population see none of its massive oil wealth. Nigeria is run by an elite of millionaires so corrupt and ineffective they do not deliver even basic services such as running water and electricity. Disenchantment is rife, not least among the 85 percent of graduates who are unemployed. In such circumstances extreme solutions have their attractions. But ever more extreme forms of Islam are not the answer. Good governance is. To say that is not a pious ideal. Progress is possible, as was shown when Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was Nigeria's finance minister from 2003 to 2006. She introduced reforms and Nigeria went from the most corrupt nation on earth to just the sixth most. But the corrupt elite got rid of the reformer and things are slipping backwards. The solutions have all been set out. Nigeria needs openness about government revenues and budgets. It needs Western governments to prosecute Western firms that pay bribes there.

Briefing Parliament's human settlements committee yesterday, Dlabantu said the issue was complex and a good programme was needed to ensure deserving applicants benefited. He said it was also difficult keeping track of people living in informal settlements who applied for housing as they moved from one area to another. ""If you are dealing with a (densely populated informal) settlement you have a number of variables. Those things affect the way your database is structured."" In the past corrupt officials and politicians had tampered with beneficiary lists and allocated houses to friends and family or people who had paid them money to get the houses. ""The lists as they stand in the country are not useful (or) helpful,"" Dlabantu said. The fact that people living in informal settlements moved around aided corruption. Cope MP Thozamile Botha said the beneficiary list had always presented a headache for the government. In some instances houses were constructed, yet after the project was completed the houses remained unoccupied, said Botha. ""You end up sitting with vacant houses and they are vandalised."" Dlabantu said the age and vulnerability of would-be housing beneficiaries would be looked at when it came to determining the order of preference for people receiving housing."648,Cape Times (South Africa),8/21/2009,"Infighting, corruption and nepotism are ruining North West, warns ANC report",e2 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (94%),NEWS; Pg. 5,CT,Newspaper,XOLANI MBANJWA,ENGLISH,460 words,,20-Aug-09,,CORRUPTION (90%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%); MAYORS (89%); CITY GOVERNMENT (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); ORGANIZED CRIME (78%); SOCCER (69%); DISMISSALS (69%),"A top-level ANC report has revealed how political infighting, corruption and nepotism within its own ranks have brought municipalities in the North West to the brink of collapse. The report - a copy of which is in the possession of the Cape Times - warns that the ANC's ability to direct government in the province is under ""severe threat"" and urges the intervention of the national leadership. It describes how at least four factions were competing against one another in a bid for control of the province - including one it says is a ""secret mafia"" known as the ""N4 Task Team"" which was responsible for ""siphoning and looting"" state resources. Blame is laid at the door of the party's own top provincial officials for the infighting, fraud, corruption and nepotism which became the order of the day. The 38-page report describes how political battles between the warring factions disrupted service delivery to the extent that local government started collapsing. Service delivery was severely disrupted - igniting the recent spate of service delivery protests. The report warns that almost all municipalities in the province are in a state of crisis. ""The protests and strikes led to continuing collapse in service delivery so that the municipalities reached a complete state of decay and saw the progressive collapse of governance,"" it states. The report was compiled by a task team deployed by the ANC's national executive committee, which completed an investigation into factionalism in the North West in May. The party's provincial executive committee (PEC) was subsequently disbanded in July and replaced by a special task team. The revelations come as the ANC this week suspended the party membership of former PEC member, Themba Gwabeni - after he was sacked as mayor of the Ngaka Modiri-Molema district municipality. The municipality is the second largest district in North West, in both size and population, and comprises five local municipalities: Ditsobotla, Mafikeng, Ratlou, Tswaing and Ramotshere Moiloa. Gwabeni was suspended after taking Provincial and co-operative governance Minister Sicelo Shiceka to court in a challenge to Shiceka's decision to put the municipality under administration. In its report, the NEC team criticised Gwabeni's decision to divert R8.7 million earmarked for water projects to fund a year-long soccer excursion to Brazil for teenagers early this year. Gwabeni could not be reached for comment. The team said the PEC was responsible allowed the formation of factions at branch, regional and provincial level. The team says the PEC ensured more than 90 percent of ANC members - who had been municipal managers, mayors, chief whips or other key municipal officials - were removed through a ""systematic and executed plan of action""."649,Cape Times (South Africa),8/27/2009,"Majali faces arrest for money laundering, fraud and corruption",e2 Edition,IRAQ (91%),NEWS; Pg. 1,CT,Newspaper,Own Correspondent  and Motswako Media,ENGLISH,214 words,,8-Jan-10,,ARREST WARRANTS (91%); MONEY LAUNDERING (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); ARRESTS (90%); CONTRACT AWARDS (77%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (77%); ASSET FORFEITURE (76%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (73%); LAWYERS (69%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (68%),"JOHANNESBURG: Sandile Majali, the enigmatic man at the centre of the oilgate scandal, faces arrest.

A meeting last Tuesday of the portfolio committee on correctional services - where the unit was scheduled to present a report about its investigations - was cancelled at the last minute because of an ANC caucus meeting. DA shadow minister on correctional services James Selfe yesterday told the Cape Times that the new programme for Parliament's fourth quarter, which resumed on Tuesday, did not feature a meeting between the committee and the unit. Selfe said he would write a letter to committee chairman Vincent Smith ""to request him to reinstate the meeting of the committee as a matter of urgency"". He said the unit had uncovered prima facie evidence of ""substantial corruption and wasteful expenditure"" by the Department of Correctional Services, and the committee and public needed greater clarity on the matter. Smith yesterday said he was determined to schedule a meeting with the unit within the first two weeks of Parliament business resuming. The committee also had to reschedule last week's meeting with Judge Siraj Desai, who heads the National Council of Correctional Services and is reviewing the law on medical parole, Smith said. Meanwhile, the IFP and Cope have called on Correctional Services Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula to publicly release the investigation unit's report on its probe. IFP spokesman on correctional services Koos van der Merwe said the fact that the report could implicate top officials ""is no reason to delay making it public"". Cope MP and former portfolio committee chairman Dennis Bloem said Mapisa-Nqakula should prove to the public ""that she is serious about getting the department in order"". The unit will tell the portfolio committee in its submission, a copy of which is in the Cape Times's possession, that it had found evidence of collusion between department officials and suppliers and of bidders drafting their own tender specifications for contracts they later won. These include prisons catering and security services. It has handed a copy of its report on the investigation to the National Prosecuting Authority for a decision on whether to prosecute. A copy of the unit's report, which recommends disciplinary action against 22 officials, also went to Mapisa-Nqakula. Her office said she would submit it to the cabinet first. The investigations unit said in its submission that R6.9 million had already been recovered in its probe into the 200 most expensive contracts in the department, while assets of R12m were under restraint and a R4.8m saving had been made. Further asset seizures were pending."658,Cape Times (South Africa),10/2/2009,"Increase in crime, corruption takes South Africa to ninth place in Africa governance rankings",E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (79%),NEWS; Pg. 5,CT,Newspaper, Basildon Peta Foreign Service,ENGLISH,569 words,HARVARD UNIVERSITY (91%),1-Oct-09,"JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA (92%); VICTORIA, SEYCHELLES (73%)",CRIME RATES (91%); CORRUPTION (90%); RULE OF LAW (90%); RANKINGS (90%); HOMICIDE (78%); ACADEMIC FREEDOM (78%); CIVIL RIGHTS (73%); HUMAN RIGHTS (73%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (73%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (71%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS (69%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (64%); SPONSORSHIP (64%); WEALTHY PEOPLE (64%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (64%),"SOUTH Africa has slipped four places down an African governance index compiled by Harvard University because of growing corruption and crime. Although still among the 10 best-governed countries in Africa, South Africa dropped from fifth place last year to ninth this year, after Mauritius, Seychelles, Cape Verde, Botswana, Tunisia, Ghana, Algeria and Namibia. S227o Tomí© and Pr237ncipe secured 10th place. Presenting the 2009 index of African governance in Joburg yesterday, Professor Robert Rotberg, of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, attributed South Africa's slide in the rankings mainly to an increase in corruption and crime, including the fourth highest rate of homicide in the world, after Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. South Africa had recently overtaken Colombia in the homicide stakes. South Africa also dropped down the rankings because of lower scores in respect to civil and political rights and the rule of law. Its lowest scores were in the categories of ""respect for physical integrity rights"" and for ""safety and security"" because of crime. The index also questioned South Africa's performance in dealing with poverty and inequality. The index ranked Zimbabwe among the worst 10 governed countries in Africa. Swaziland slid badly from 34th last year to 42nd this year. The index assesses the performance of countries in five categories, namely: safety and security, the rule of law and transparency, political participation and respect for human rights, and sustainable economic development and human development. Rotberg announced that the index, which he had founded, had severed ties with its original sponsor, multibillionaire telecoms tycoon Mo Ibrahim, because he had wanted to ""control"" the index. Academics felt this would violate academic freedom and integrity. Ibrahim's Foundation is due to release its own good governance index on Monday. Rotberg admitted it was ""ridiculous"" to have two indices covering the same ground, but said his was ""the authentic index done in the way we conceived"". The Harvard index is now sponsored by the World Peace Foundation. The top 10 worst performers characterised by what Rotberg called despotism, poverty and poor governance were Guinea, Zimbabwe, Angola, Eritrea, Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Chad and Sudan. Somalia was ranked last. Improving governance in Africa was the ultimate purpose of the index, as governments could use it to better their performance in specific areas while civic society could use the index to agitate for improvements in the lives of citizens, Rotberg said. South Africa had also slipped because of pre-trial detentions which had increased from 27 percent to 30 percent. Another big decline was in the category of physical integrity rights in which it fared no better than Guinea, Angola and Nigeria. Physical integrity rights cover respect for the person, including non-violence. The index also judged that press freedom had declined slightly in South Africa. But Rotberg commended South Africa for its good statistical service compared to the ""appalling"" statistical standards of most African states. Most of the 10 best governed countries were those with small populations. The best governed were peaceful and prosperous. They delivered goods and services to their citizens, held free and fair elections, and were less corrupt than their neighbours, the Harvard index said."659,Cape Times (South Africa),10/6/2009,Ngcuka dismisses corruption claim against him as 'an outright lie',E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (79%),NEWS; Pg. 6,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,229 words,,5-Oct-09,,BRIBERY (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); AGREEMENTS (78%); MURDER (78%); EXTORTION (78%); CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); ARREST WARRANTS (73%); ARRESTS (73%); PLEA AGREEMENTS (71%); SENTENCING (70%); MINES & MINING (67%),"Rautenbach allegedly committed,"" Selebi said.

According to Ngcuka: l He met Rautenbach's lawyer ""following his request to make representations for a plea agreement"". l The discussion ""reached a dead end and could not reach any agreement as we, the NPA, would not settle for any penalty that excluded custodial sentence"". l He had taken a principled decision not to become involved in the mining industry ""to avoid any perceived conflict of interests because my wife, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, was the minister of minerals and energy at the time"". Ngcuka said it was ""baffling"" that Selebi ""did not charge me following his alleged discovery"". It is the State's case that Selebi received a $30 000 (about R225 000) bribe from Rautenbach through murder suspect Glenn Agliotti in exchange for protecting Rautenbach from an arrest warrant."660,Cape Times (South Africa),10/13/2009,There's nothing quite like the whiff of corruption in the fresh spring air,E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (79%),Pg. 9,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,661 words,INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL POLICE ORGANIZATION (INTERPOL) (83%),12-Oct-09,,CORRUPTION (90%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (90%); LARCENY & THEFT (90%); ETHNIC CONFLICTS (77%); SMUGGLING (76%); FAILED & FRAGILE STATES (76%); ART THEFT (76%); HOMICIDE (73%); ORGANIZED CRIME (72%); WAR CRIMES (70%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (67%); GENOCIDE (67%); CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES CRIME (65%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (65%); PAINTING (64%); DRUG TRAFFICKING (64%); MURDER (58%); HUMAN TRAFFICKING (50%),"A MOST curious smell is wafting through our neighbourhood. I suspect it emanates from the small dagga plantation of my odious neighbour, Gatvol van der Pomp. Is he all that he seems - a stinking hairy bigot compelled to marry his third wife (his sister) at the point of a pistol? In other words, a normal South African reptile content to watch the eggs hatch in his burrow as he gapes at thugby matches on his stolen TV set - powered by stolen electricity - and cheering the home team as they mash the opposition into the mud. If I didn't know better, I would suspect Gatvol of boiling cockroaches in methyl alcohol left over from his customary Saturday night revels. But I do know better: it's only a small step from odious to odorous, and the diffusing fug is down to the fact that he last bathed in a previous century. Still, when the former head of Interpol is on trial for corruption, it does no harm to suspect one's neighbours of being fugitives from justice. In short, is Gatvol really a scion of the Van der Pomp clan? He has the family's distinctive stigmata: not only do his eyebrows meet in the centre of his head, his eyes do so too. Unfortunately he also bears some resemblance to one of the International Criminal Police Organisation's Most Wanted list, Ermek Maratovich Abdyldaev of Kyrgystan. Interpol advertises on its website that this ruffian is most wanted for one of the following: war crimes, genocide, drug smuggling, mafia membership, stealing Van Gogh paintings, trafficking in human beings and aliens, political graft, serial killing and/or rape. I am forced to remind myself that we all look guilty of something, and probably are; and that Gatvol's resemblance to Ermek is of no more significance than, say, Jackie Selebi's to a cornered rat. But even a failed state has its standards and we must all be on the lookout for worms in bad apples. Selebi's tenure as President of Interpol - less than four years before conscience led him to resign - was in the great tradition of that august law enforcement entity. For some years (again, in a previous century) the top job was held by such notables as SS General Reinhard Heydrich and Einsatzgruppenfíhrer Arthur Nebe, who while only personally responsible for murdering 46 000 people was a notable shrimper, or toe-sucker. You don't enter such ranks for nothing - not even a slap-up million-rand dinner for the big Interpol knobs paid for by Brett Kebble, the late art lover and free marketeer. And who was Brett Kebble, you may well ask since all our news and information is fished from the stagnant pond of the SABC? In consequence, our memories are threadbare. Well, before he was executed (possibly by a Scarface clone, the weepy Glenn Agliotti), Brett was famous as a nerd and fraud. In the great tradition of Anglo American, if he needed a good press, he bought it. So he bought Finance Week and two prominent hacks, Dave and Nigel, to run it. Today Nigel hunts foxes in rural England. Dave could be anywhere. But all that is history, along with forced removals and crony capitalism. Besides which, Heydrich & Co had the endorsement of that nice Mr Hitler. Strange how such chains of names link our present with our past. Mulling over this, I wobbled to the smelly Van der Pomp residence. Like a towering anthill, most of the activity is underground and secretive. Drunk as a judge in a warren of cobwebs, mongrels, open paint cans and displaced wives and kiddies I found Gatvol straddling a potjie, stirring away with an elderly SAR&H soup spoon - huge really, and chunky as all aged things are. He saw me in the gloom: ""Sorry about the stench, Bru. I'm just making a curry and fishpaste stew for the usual security okes. They call in every so often for freebies - and I have to give them something or they might shoot me. I'll keep the stew warm over a burning Bic8482 lighter."" So. I and the neighbours will just have to get used to the permanent whiff of corruption in the fresh spring air."661,Cape Times (South Africa),10/26/2009,OPPOSITION ALLEGES COVER-UP Land Bank corruption probe under way - Hawks,E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (79%),NEWS; Pg. 5,CT,Newspaper, XOLANI MBANJWA Political Bureau,ENGLISH,595 words,,25-Oct-09,,INVESTIGATIONS (93%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); FARMERS & RANCHERS (90%); CORRUPTION (89%); POLITICS (89%); EXECUTIVES (75%); FORENSICS (73%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (73%),"Hawks spokesman Musa Zondi insisted yesterday that investigations were under way into the alleged ransacking of a R100-million BEE fund meant for poor farmers and financed by the taxpayer, as opposition parties accused the government of a cover-up. Zondi said there was was ""pressure"" from stakeholders to expedite the investigation. He refused to identify them, however. He also refused to say when the investigation was launched or when it was due to be concluded. The Cape Times reported in July that arrests were imminent after Land Bank chief executive officer Phakamani Hadebe told MPs information about irregularities had been handed to police. A report in the Sunday Times yesterday alleged that former Gauteng housing MEC Dan Mofokeng, former Land Bank executive Phil Mohlahlane, his sister-in-law Jessica Mojanaga and a Hazyview doctor had benefited from the fund to the tune of millions. It was also alleged that, although information about alleged irregularities had been available to law enforcement agencies for at least a year, formal charges had yet to be laid. Hadebe said the Land Bank had paid out money towards expediting the forensic investigation. ""We would really like to see this thing (arrests) happening soon because we have gone the extra mile in achieving that,"" he said. ""We are helping the police by getting additional resources at the cost of the Land Bank to move this thing speedily."" The Land Bank wanted all former executives implicated in wrongdoing to face the music, Hadebe said. ""All those that were implicated within the bank are no longer there. We got rid of them. ""But acting on the allegations is the job of the police and they are running a number of investigations. They are on top of it and we are not sitting on our side not doing anything,"" Hadebe said. The National African Farmers Union (Nafu) called for action, saying farmers had been ""short-circuited"" because funds meant for poor and emerging farmers were used to fund lavish lifestyles of those who were politically connected. Nafu president Otto Mbangula said farmers were ""severely"" affected because of past corruption at the bank. ""We are totally unhappy at the way the bank was conducting business. But now the bank is turning the corner. It has failed African farmers because, in the past, black and emerging farmers were being short- circuited. ""Getting a loan from the bank was a mountain, particularly for black farmers, because money was spent on non-core agriculture. Those involved in corruption must face the law. The Land Bank (executives) and their friends were buying golf estates and spending the money on themselves and football clubs,"" said Mbangula. Democratic Alliance agriculture spokesman Piet Pretorius said dragging out the investigation suggested there was a cover-up to protect those involved. ""If the government is serious about rooting out corruption and if the official excuse is to be believed that investigating authorities are still considering the reports, then government must ensure that its investigating authorities get their acts together,"" he said.

Cape Town was excluded from the exercise because, unlike those of most municipalities, its database was up to date, he said. Tenders had been invited and an independent service provider would be appointed soon to conduct the project. The estimated 450 000 housing backlog has been a bone of contention for a long time and many people have complained about waiting for up to 28 years while people who have applied much later have received houses. In December, 2007, hundreds of families, fed up with the wait, illegally occupied incomplete houses in Delft. Madikezela said yesterday that people who had already benefited from housing opportunities, but whose names re-appeared on updated lists, would not have another chance to get a house as they would be removed from the provincial database. ""We want to take a very strong stance on this. There are people who have benefited before and either sold those houses or rented them and moved back to shacks,"" Madikezela said. The new database would help establish a more accurate picture on issues such as income levels and whether people lived in informal settlements, backyards or overcrowded formal structures. The provincial housing chief director for planning and development, Jacqui Samson, said various databases and housing allocation systems at municipalities would be streamlined to help improve transparency and ensure fair allocation of houses. Information collected would assist planning and determine what type of housing was required in various areas. The project's first phase, expected to take four months and for which R2.5 million had been budgeted, would assess how the councils' housing management systems worked and data was collected, she said. In April phase two would see the design of a strategy to support municipalities to improve their systems. The provincial database, which would be open to the public, would to be linked to a national database to ensure people who had obtained houses elsewhere in the country were not considered for houses in the province.

Both have faced corruption charges. But while Zuma's legal case was dropped, Berlusconi has had to pass legislation to keep himself out of the dock. Recently, with speculation rife that Zuma may grant Schabir Shaik a presidential pardon, Berlusconi proposed more laws to quash lingering, serious fraud indictments against himself. Frankly, if the ANC really wants to peer into the future it should send a fact finding mission to Rome to study the fate of the Democrazia Cristiana (DC) party, which once seemed set to rule (in Zuma's phrase) ""until Jesus comes"". For even though they had the backing of the Vatican, rather than Pastor Ray McCaulay, the once seeming invincible DC imploded virtually overnight. Just like the ANC, its strength was its greatest weakness. The Italian Christian Democrats had such a broad constituency, from far right to extreme left, that at one point the party had six separate HQs in Rome, representing the separate factions. The only thing that kept this disparate organisation together was the glue of power. It also practised ""deployment."" Party loyalists were appointed to government agencies, state television and the powerful Italian parastatals. Even minor appointments were often political. The consequence was paralysis, nepotism and rampant corruption. Ministers were appointed in order to keep the different factions happy rather than for ability. As a result there was a revolving cabinet carousel, with the same dull faces appearing year after year in different posts. No one was ever sacked for incompetence. As with the ANC, party factions were often more at war with one another than they were with the opposition. The different groupings often traded insults openly and fought bitter internal battles for positions of influence. Frequently, as has proved the case here with intra-ANC battles, the state's spy agencies were abused to settle party scores. The major difference, however, is that the South African Communist Party is an integral part of the governing alliance, even if it is one that yaps at the heels of the ANC. On the other hand, the only ideological aim of the Christian Democrats, apart from maintaining a clammy grip on power, was to keep the Italian Communists out in the cold. Yet even here there are instructive similarities. After World War 2, when the Christian Democrats came to power, they were briefly forced to include Communists in a unity government. However Communist ministers, exactly as in South Africa today, soon discovered that they had to demonstrate their moderation. In 1947, as the Italian prime minister prepared to fly to the US to meet President Harry Truman, Communist Finance Minister Mauro Scoccimarro stayed up all night to prepare a budget to show how under ""red"" control finances were being responsibly managed. In fact the prime minister was flying to Washington to discuss with Truman how to dump the Communists. The reason why all this would repay close study is that many of the tensions that confronted post-war Italy were precisely the ones that face South Africa today: the tension between modernity and tradition, and the dramatic and seemingly intractable rich/poor split. And, of course, the sheer ruthlessness of organised crime. The way that the Italian ruling class went about tackling these crucial social dilemmas would present a master class in exactly how not to solve such problems. But the ANC is repeating many of the same, potentially ruinous mistakes. Zuma's appointment of the government ""yes man"", Menzi Simelane, to head the National Prosecuting Authority, for example, appears to be a move of Berlusconian opportunism. The DC ruled for nearly 50 years, finally collapsing in the early 1990s in a putrid swamp of corruption. It only clung to power for so long by playing on the Communist scare. Ironically, this party disintegrated at the very same time as its red bogeyman. The fact is, inventive Italians only managed to thrive despite their governments. The danger for the ANC is to follow a similar route: gradually becoming ever more sclerotic and attracting only cynical careerists with an eye to looting state resources. But perhaps the greatest warning is what follows such a final collapse: in the subsequent vacuum the worst elements rise to the surface. In Italy, the greatest beneficiary of the rampant corruption of the 1980s and 1990s, Silvio Berlusconi, bizarrely became prime minister on a wave of populism, governing with neo-Fascists and strident xenophobes. The equivalent scenario in South Africa would be: after his early release from prison on ""health grounds"", Schabir Shaik is not only pardoned but survives into grand old age - long enough not only to outlive the ANC and its demise, but to become president.

He said he was disappointed that President Jacob Zuma did not announce measures to deal with corruption and ""crass materialism"" in government ranks. ""He should have announced a lifestyle audit to dispel a deep-seated belief that the levels of corruption and abuse of state power to advance the commercial interests of some in the cabinet and among directors-general leave much to be desired and are putting South Africa on a route to (becoming) a predator state,"" Vavi said. While Cosatu ""generally"" welcomed the contents of the State of the Nation address, it was unhappy about some aspects, particularly Zuma's failure to articulate the government's position on the restructuring of the economy. His speech had, however, reassured Cosatu that the government was being guided by priorities spelled out in the ANC's election manifesto. ""In pursuit of these priorities we therefore warmly welcome, among other (things), the recommitment to extending the public works programme and congratulate (the government) for nearly realising its target of creating 500 000 jobs. The government has created 480 000."" Also welcomed were the extension of social grants to two million more children and the commitment to introducing a national health insurance. Noting that the government was to set up a R1 billion fund to guarantee private sector loans for people earning too little to qualify for bank mortgages, Vavi said Cosatu was disappointed the money would not be provided as direct subsidies. Cosatu was also disappointed that Zuma had not acknowledged that the country faced a ""structural unemployment crisis"".

Why is corruption a problem? We shouldn't think of opposing corruption because we're goody-goodies and corruption is wrong. We fight corruption because it hurts what we most want to achieve in society. Corruption slows economic progress. Axel Dreher and his colleagues estimate that corruption is responsible for a reduction of 63 percent in per capita income in sub-Saharan Africa. My research with Johannes Fedderke of UCT shows that, other things being equal, countries with more corruption have less investment, and each dollar of investment has less impact on growth. Daniel Kaufmann and his colleagues find bad governance has direct and negative effects on long-term outcomes such as infant mortality and educational attainment. Two more points, and listen up ANC: corruption hurts the poor, not the rich. Corruption undercuts democracy. As John T Noonan has said, dictatorship and corruption are the two great sins of government. Can anything be done about corruption? The short answer is yes. Around the world, you find cities and towns, ministries and agencies, and countries making progress in the fight against corruption. Not everywhere, to be sure, and even with the success stories progress is not overnight. The battle against corruption is never complete, and ""re-corruption"" is always a threat. Despite success stories in reducing corruption, it's surprising how cynical people can become about corruption, to the point of fallacy. ""Corruption has existed throughout history. Every country has corruption, even the most advanced. So, what can be done about it? Nothing."" To see the fallacy clearly, substitute ""disease"" for ""corruption."" No one would conclude nothing can be done about disease, that there is no use for public health programmes, doctors, hospitals, or medicine. Like disease, corruption comes in many forms, some cancerous, some mild. Like disease, corruption can be widespread like a pandemic or occasional like the mumps. Like disease, prevention is important, and so is treatment of diseased members of the body politic. And now to the most important part of the big picture. You in South Africa are at the point of making progress against corruption. And if you don't lose heart, you can do it. Yes, you still have and will continue to have scandals ranging from tendering to social services, with accusations and counter-accusations of corruption and being framed for corruption. But consider your progress. The very fact so much evidence has recently been uncovered is a good sign. Your investigators and auditors are mobilised. Your press and media are staunchly against corruption. The finance minister highlighted the fight against corruption in his budget speech. Arrests are being made. Lifestyle audits are being debated as never before. And the government is better organised, at least in theory, thanks to the inter-ministerial committee on corruption set up in November. How can South Africa do even better? As a long-time visitor to your country, but only a visitor, my advice can only be suggestive. Drawing from the experience of other countries, I believe South Africa's continued progress depends on three things. First, anti-corruption is only partly about enforcement. It is also about prevention. Hong Kong's famed Independent Commission against Corruption was created with three wings - enforcement, prevention, and popular participation. The prevention wing contained management consultants, IT experts and accountants, who worked with various ministries to analyse vulnerabilities to corruption - and then to help reduce those vulnerabilities. Prevention goes beyond vigorous inspections and audits. Systemic reforms are also required. There is a formula for corruption: C = M + D - A. Corruption equals Monopoly plus Discretion minus Accountability. If a person has monopoly power over a good or service, has the discretion to decide how much you get, and faces no accountability, corruption thrives. To fight corruption, monopoly power has to be leavened and competition increased. Discretion in official actions must be limited, and the rules of the game must be clear. Accountability must be enhanced, through performance indicators and feedback from citizens, businesses, and public officials themselves. Here is where my second point comes in. To enhance accountability, South African civil society must be more vital and effective. The business community can do even more to help diagnose corrupt systems and then to take effective action. Business people do not like to pay bribes or be extorted. They may find in some cases that corruption is necessary to win a tender or to avoid crippling red tape. Businesses have it in their interest to move to a different equilibrium, where corruption and influence-peddling are greatly reduced - and where companies can spend their time innovating, cutting costs, and improving quality rather than figuring out how to cultivate political connections or evade extortion. Third, education is crucial. South Africa's schools and universities can do even more in the fight against corruption. South Africa should declare education as a corruption-free zone. You can follow the example of Indonesia's Paramadina University, which requires all undergraduate students to take a course in anti-corruption. You can support research on anti-corruption efforts, ranging from evaluations to prevention studies. South Africa is one of the most important countries in the world. The world is watching - and hoping you succeed. As you create a peaceful and diverse society, a flourishing democracy, and a country where corruption is not ""the way we do things,"" you will be leaders in the 21st century. l Klitgaard is professor of economics at Claremont Graduate University in California and the author of eight books, including Controlling Corruption and High-Performance Government.

It said that Mozambican judge Dimas Marroa had sentenced former transport and communication minister Antonio Munguambe to 20 years in prison for stealing state funds, the highest-level corruption conviction ever in the country. The report prompted the thought: when was the last time one of Africa's ""big fish"" was convicted of corruption? Nothing recent came to mind. Second perhaps only to political violence, corruption is bleeding this continent dry. After some promising initiatives over the last two decades or so, the fight against it seems to be flagging. Former Zambian president Frederick Chiluba was for the last decade or so perhaps the biggest fish in the dock for corruption. His successor, the late Levy Mwanawasa, put him there for stealing $500 000 out of the public coffers, small change for the man later convicted by a British court of stealing nearly $50 million in public money during his decade in office. But in August last year the Zambian courts acquitted Chiluba, despite the fact that his wife Regina had already been convicted of receiving some of the stolen goods from him. Meanwhile in Nigeria, the granddaddy of Africa's corrupt states, Nuhu Ribadu, whom former president Olusegun Obasanjo had appointed as the first head of the country's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, was sent on a one-year training course in December 2007 by Obasanjo's successor Umaru Yar-Adua, after his agency charged a wealthy, politically connected former governor for bribery. Ribadu got the hint and fled to England on return from his training course, telling the New York Times rather pertinently: ""If you fight corruption, it fights you back."" Ribadu's fate echoed that of John Githongo, Kenya's anti-corruption chief, who also fled to England in 2005, after going after some big fish. In these countries, as often elsewhere, anti-corruption efforts are usually launched by the current leader against his political enemies and, when power changes hands, the efforts are dropped. That, depressingly, is a pattern that has also been followed here at home, of course. The dropping of charges against President Jacob Zuma last year disturbingly puts us in the same boat as more infamously corrupt countries like Kenya and Nigeria. If anything tells us we are increasingly becoming part of the continent, rather than some quasi-Western bridging nation attached to its lower extremity, it is this. The New York Times has quoted Daniel Kaufmann, an authority on corruption at Washington's Brookings Institution, as saying: ""We are witnessing an era of major backtracking on the anti-corruption drive. And one of the most poignant illustrations is the fate of the few anti-corruption commissions that have had courageous leadership. They're either embattled or dead."" This is true. A study by Transparency International has shown that none of the anti-corruption agencies launched with fanfare in countries like Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania or Uganda has any independence from the government. Their heads are appointed by the president and may be fired by him. That is the critical failing, of course. Without such independence, anti-corruption easily becomes just another arrow in the already-crowded quiver of powers the typical African president commands to persecute his enemies. Is the Munguambe conviction different? It seems so. He was elevated from deputy minister to full minister by current President Armando Guebuza in 2005 after he took over from Joaquim Chissano. If there are no underlying political rivalries which the outside observer has not detected, Guebuza will stand out as a rare leader on this continent; a genuine enemy of corruption."670,Cape Times (South Africa),3/12/2010,Farmer challenging suspension now probed for corruption,E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (94%),NEWS; Pg. 5,CT,Newspaper, KAREN BREYTENBACH Justice Writer,ENGLISH,408 words,,11-Mar-10,,INVESTIGATIONS (91%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); TEA (90%); TEA FARMING (90%); EXECUTIVES (89%); BOARDS OF DIRECTORS (89%); LITIGATION (89%); AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS (78%); SUITS & CLAIMS (78%); FORENSICS (77%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (73%); BUSINESS FINANCIAL TROUBLE (71%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (53%),"A ROOIBOS tea farmer who is challenging his alleged unlawful suspension as managing director of a state-funded tea enterprise that uplifts emerging farmers in the Nieuwoudtville area is being investigated for alleged corruption. In December, the board of directors of Nieuwoudtville Rooibos Pty Ltd suspended its managing director, Tobie Nel, with full pay, and prohibited him from entering his office or from keeping his laptop. The company has since appointed forensic auditors Ernst & Young to investigate whether Nel had bought in rooibos from other areas, undermining the company and its multimillion-rand, government-sponsored empowerment project for the Hantam District. The allegations were made after a fact-finding mission by the Northern Cape Department of Agriculture. A forensic report is expected within two weeks. Nel, however, alleged in court papers that he suspected his suspension was related to his alerting the Northern Cape government to the company's financial crisis. He said he had begged for assistance to save the project, but none had been forthcoming. All he had received was resistance from the government official who had, since his suspension, stepped into his shoes. Nel challenged his suspension in an urgent application in the Western Cape High Court yesterday. His counsel, Ray McClarty SC, argued that Nel was entitled to a spoliation order that would entitle him to go back to work and get back his work keys, phone and laptop. McClarty said Nel was suspended without warning and prohibited from going back to work under the threat that if he did, he would face disciplinary or legal action. McClarty said it was unlawful for a board of directors to suspend a director, as only shareholders could do this. He had a right to return to his fiduciary duties of managing the company. It was not correct of the company to say that he was not entitled to spoliation because he did not resist the suspension and prohibition. Although he did not chain himself to his desk, he did not consent to suspension and immediately sought legal help, McClarty said. Advocate Guy Elliott, for Nieuwoudtville Rooibos, said the board was entitled to suspend Nel because he was, by legal definition, a senior emplo-yee, not a director. Elliott ar-gued that Nel had not dealt with his suspension in two months, therefore it created the impression that he passively complied with it.

Consider South Africa and Peru. In his budget speech, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan cited the discovery of corruption amounting to more than R2 billion. In five months, South African investigators identified 1 200 officials ""as having participated in tender fraud or having received money and not paid taxes on it"". Meanwhile, in Peru, the Comptroller of the Republic, Fuad Khoury, recently talked about that country's corruption investigations. "" 'Commissions' of 10, 15 or 20 percent have been talked about before,"" Khoury said, ""but we have found squandering of almost 100 percent."" Beginning last August in Peru, 120 investigators made unannounced audits in four regions. They found ""very important evidence of corruption"". The tricks were the same ones found throughout the world. Projects and purchases have price tags far above market prices. Salaries are paid to phantom personnel. Unauthorised advances are paid. Money is stolen, with pretend receipts. Sound familiar? But the Peruvians may be even bolder than elsewhere. In Ancash, regional president Cí©sar 193lvarez created a project to improve the Wecrococha-Pochgoj irrigation canal, which is located, as one Peruvian journalist put it, ""in the middle of nowhere."" The project was budgeted at over $1.5 million (R10.87m). The regional government cashed cheques for $1.25 million. Investigators visited the middle of nowhere and found that absolutely no work had been done. Or how about this case of political contempt overwhelming internal controls? In the town of Pallasca, the mayor paid the equivalent of R2.4m for the delivery of a front-end loader and a mixer that cost less than R1.1m. The town's treasurer told investigators that he brought this difference to the mayor's attention. ""Just write the cheque, dammit!"" the mayor replied, after threatening to fire the treasurer. Note this, South Africans. Despite uncovering such egregious cases, the Peruvian investigations have already sparked resistance and excuses. Regional president 193lvarez complained that the investigations were ""impeding the continuity of the Ancash regional government's activities, paralysing its administration and management."" On January 8, at his request the Second Joint Court of Huaraz passed an injunction suspending ""surprise investigations"". In both South Africa and Peru, inspections and audits are bearing fruit. Anti-corruption leaders in government are providing strong direction. In both countries, newspapers and magazines are ardent opponents of corruption. And in both countries, despite some arrests being made, no ""big fish"" have been fried. Now both countries must move from finding corruption to fixing it. This will require both preventing and subverting corruption. Prevention means making government systems, such as tendering, more resistant to dishonest officials and bribe-giving business people. To fight corruption, monopoly powers have to be reduced and competition increased. Discretion in official actions must be circumscribed. Accountability must be enhanced, through performance indicators and feedback from citizens, businesses, and public officials themselves. Conflict of interest is an urgent area for reform. No political party should own a company that participates in public tenders. No government official or party leader-or their relatives-should participate in tenders. With the huge numbers of cases of corruption reported in these countries, the right metaphor here is not cowboy corruption but organised crime. Once corruption becomes systemic, you have to go beyond prevention to subversion. Subverting corruption means understanding corrupt systems, identifying their weak points, and going after them using the tools from fighting organised crime. First you have to understand how organised corruption works. Take tendering, for example. How are corrupt buyers and sellers found and matched? How do they make and enforce their implicit contracts? What footprints do their illicit transaction create, and how do they try to cover them up? To find the answers, ask the people. Citizens know where corruption affects them, from getting drivers' licenses to receiving public services. Lawyers understand the workings of corruption in legal systems. Accountants know the illicit games played with audits. Business people understand how corrupt systems of tendering work. Surprisingly, in my experience public servants will explain how corrupt systems work, as long as your questions focus on systems and not individuals and as long as they can tell you confidentially. The trick is to find out what all these parties know without putting them at risk. You can survey people anonymously, asking them where corruption takes place. You can interview insiders individually and confidentially, asking them how a corrupt system works. For example, a study of tendering should lay out the various steps: prequalifying bidders, establishing technical criteria and their weights, judging the bids, making post-award changes, and paying the contract. Each step is susceptible to corruption. Interviewees are asked, ""Here is how things are supposed to work in prequalification. In your experience, what problems tend to emerge? How prevalent do you guess these problems are? What distortions are created?"" The results of many such interviews (perhaps 15) can help you diagnose a corrupt tendering system. With this information, you go after the corrupt systems. You use undercover agents and electronic surveillance. You induce key insiders to become state witnesses. You can document extortion by using hidden video cameras, undercover agents, and confidential exit interviews. South Africa and Peru are finding lots of cases of corruption.

The rot has been evident for some time, spreading ever deeper into the very soul of the organisation, but the speed of its acceleration over the past few days with the consummation of the biggest corruption deal yet, with new injections of malevolence from the toxic Youth League leader Julius Malema and the resurrection of white racist extremism through the murder of Eugene Terre'Blanche, has poisoned the national atmosphere to a degree not seen since pre-democracy days. I don't believe Malema's insistence on singing that ""shoot the boer"" song had any direct role in Terre'Blanche's murder. But the fact that the two coincided has inflamed racial passions. Thanks to Malema, the faded and farcical Terre'Blanche's racist cause has found a new lease of life in his death. All of which means we have gone backwards on the two core principles that carried the ANC through all the long years of its liberation struggle, through the tough constitutional negotiating process and into the dawn of the new South Africa - the principle of non-racialism and the principle of clean, honest government that would deliver a better life for all. We have become a corrupt country. The Eskom expansion deal, which the World Bank consummated last Friday with a $3.75-billion (about R28bn) loan, stood to make the ANC a cool R1bn thanks to its 25 percent shareholding in Hitachi Africa to whom Eskom's former chairman, Mohammed Valli Moosa - a member of the ANC's National Executive Committee - conveniently awarded the contract. The ANC's Treasurer-General, Mathews Phosa, has now jumped in belatedly with an attempt at damage control by saying the party intends disinvesting from Hitachi Africa. At least that shows a degree of sensitivity to public outrage, but the fact remains that the ANC will still make a handsome profit from the sale of its shares in a company that has been gifted such a huge contract. Moreover, the Public Protector's highly questionable legitimising of the deal still stands. That gentleman found last February that Moosa's role did indeed constitute conflict of interest, then bizarrely declared that this didn't affect the contract. So it's OK for the ANC in its capacity as controller of the State to hand out hugely profitable contracts to the ANC in its capacity as a political party. I reckon that makes the ANC a ""tenderpreneur"". Which surely gives an official licence to all other tenderpreneurs. Two other windfalls have come the ANC's way. First was the arms deal which brought in millions. The second was Oilgate, in which our state-owned fuel corporation, PetroSA, effectively gave the ANC a buckshee R15 million to help it pay for its 2004 election campaign. In other words we, the taxpayers, effectively funded the ruling party's election. Why is all this happening? Why has corruption become so endemic? Why has it taken so long for the leadership of the ANC to crack down on Malema, whose persistent verbal abuse amounts to a form of corruption? As President Jacob Zuma has now pointed out, the Youth League is not an independent organisation but part of the ruling party. So why did the president not act long ago to stop Malema poisoning our racial atmosphere, insulting people, disparaging our courts and our constitution and the role of opposition parties and the media in a democracy, or call him to order for flying his own policy kites in conflict with those of the government, for interfering in a delicate foreign policy issue and publicly embracing a neighbouring tyrant? Why instead of doing any of that did Zuma actually praise Malema, describing him as a potential future leader of the ANC, thereby not only condoning his behaviour but emboldening him to become even more outrageous. The answer lies in what might be called the Law of Creeping Corruption. If corruption, verbal or monetary, is not dealt with the moment it manifests itself, the corrosion will spread. And the more it spreads the harder it becomes to stop. The arms deal was the ANC's original sin. One can see how it came about. The ANC leadership returned home from exile and prison after having been outlawed for 30 years. Most of the returnees had no homes to go to, no jobs to sustain themselves and their families, and the ANC itself had no premises to occupy or money to build up an organisational structure and prepare for its first election. So the need for money was acute. And as anyone with any knowledge of the ways of the world knows, the place to get quick money is in the arms bazaar. The big arms manufacturers pay fat kickbacks to secure government contracts for the supply of weaponry. And their own governments turn a blind eye to the corruption involved, for the contracts boost their budgets. So that's where the ANC went, with the thin cover-up of what were called ""offsets"", meaning an undertaking by the suppliers to invest in South Africa and help create jobs. A phoney justification because the fact is we didn't need most of those weapons, some of which have still not been delivered and many are unused. But the real crime was the cover-up which began when the scandal became public and has continued ever since. The right thing would have been for the government to institute a judicial inquiry immediately, bringing everything into the open and presenting its own urgent need for money to recover from the crime of its 30-year banning as a powerful mitigating factor. The whole thing could have been run on the lines of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, with an exchange of amnesty for truth telling. There would have been a national uproar for a few days, then the scandal would have been over - forever. Instead the facts were covered up so that they festered, periodically breaking out with new revelations and ultimately poisoning the whole body politic with its infectious suppuration. To switch the analogy, the primary cancer should have been surgically removed early. The failure to do so has allowed the cancer to metastasise to the point where the whole body politic is now riddled with it. Eradicating it now is difficult, for we have reached a kind of corruption gridlock. When so many people in high places have the dirt on each other, no-one dares blow a whistle. When the president of the country has managed to get off the hook on a major corruption case, how can he crack down on corruption anywhere else in his administration? When he rewards the acting prosecuting chief who got him off that hook with a judgeship, how can he expect to have a clean civil service all the way down to municipal level? And when it comes to Julius Malema, how can Zuma - who has turned his own machine-gun song into something of a presidential anthem - make Malema stop singing his ""shoot the boer"" song? It all boils down to a question of leadership. Good leaders lead by example. Uphold your principles and the rest will follow. Condone and cover-up and things fall apart. l Sparks is a veteran journalist and political analyst.

Introduced yesterday, it seeks to prevent provincial employees from owning a stake of more than 5 percent in companies doing business with the province. Under consideration is a two-year ""cooling off"" period for provincial employees which would prevent them from participating in provincial government tenders. Although this has not been illegal in the past, it is considered unethical and comes on the heels of the Western Cape's introduction of its own ministerial handbook. The handbook limits spending on official vehicles to R510 000. This follows the public outrage over the extravagant spending by some ANC ministers on their official vehicles. Recently it also came to light, during the disciplinary hearing of two Transet employees, that Communications Minister Siphiwe Nyanda's security company GNS (General Nyanda Security) received a tender of R55 million despite having no employees and not being registered with the security regulatory authority. The bill states that before the provincial government enters into any contract ""with an entity for the sale, lease or supply of goods or services, the entity must provide an affidavit... disclosing any business interests that an employee or family member of has in the entity"". Companies which failed to comply could see their contracts cancelled and damages claimed by the provincial government. Employees and departmental heads of any provincial entity could face disciplinary action which could include dismissal. Exceptions would be made for the health sector and current contracts. Zille said the absence of restrictions on state employees doing business with the government was a ""key driver"" for corruption. ""State employees with an interest in companies that tender for goods and services have a clear conflict of interest, yet this has never been regulated,"" said Zille. The DA leader challenged President Jacob Zuma and the eight other provincial legislatures to pass similar legislation. In August, 2008, Auditor-General Patrick Nombembe found that between April, 2005, and January, 2007, more than R540m of business was conducted between provincial governments and businesses owned or part-owned by provincial employees. Zille said this was only ""the tip of the iceberg"". ""At national level, between August, 2007, and July, 2008, 49 state employees were identified as directors of companies that did business with national governments to the tune of R35.7m,"" said Zille. She said although Zuma had acknowledged the problem nothing had been done about it at national level. Sixty-five employees of the provincial government have been subjected to an audit of their interests. quinton.mtyala@inl.co.za"676,Cape Times (South Africa),4/22/2010,special unit KEPT BUSY Municipalities investigated for corruption and fraud,E2 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (94%),NEWS; Pg. 3,CT,Newspaper, BABALO NDENZE Metro Writer,ENGLISH,552 words,,22-Apr-10,,INVESTIGATIONS (93%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%); CITY GOVERNMENT (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); MAYORS (89%); CONTRACT AWARDS (89%); INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS (79%); INTERNAL AUDITS (79%); ETHICS (78%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (78%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (78%); TREASURY DEPARTMENTS (77%); AGREEMENTS (77%); POLLS & SURVEYS (75%); CRIME PREVENTION (74%); AUDITS (64%),"FRAUD, corruption, the irregular sale of council-owned property and the illegal awarding of lucrative tenders have characterised some of the biggest municipalities in the Western Cape, now under investigation by the Special Investigating Unit (SIU). These included Theewaterskloof, Witzenberg, Bitou, Stellenbosch and Oudtshoorn, Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning MEC Anton Bredell said in a statement yesterday. But Stiffie Cronje, deputy director of the Theewaterskloof manager's office, rejected Bredell's statement. He said the corruption referred to by the MEC in his statement was by a previous administration. Because the statement did not make clear this context, Theewaterskloof wanted Bredell to withdraw it because it was causing irreparable damage to the municipality's reputation. Bredell said that so determined was his department to stamp out fraud and corruption, it was to conduct a survey in a further 29 local and district municipalities to check whether government rules and regulations were being adhered to. Bredell said the investigation of the municipalities was a clear sign that corruption would not be tolerated at local government level. ""While certain municipalities presented no irregularities or instances of fraud, the investigations have, in some instances, led to criminal charges against municipal officials for other offences,"" said Bredell. l In the Bitou Municipality, findings were made and the department laid criminal charges against former municipal manager George Seitisho and former mayor Euan Wildeman. Their next court appearance will be on June 22. l In Stellenbosch, the third largest municipality in the province, the SIU is busy investigating cases of fraud, corruption and maladministration that were revealed by the municipal audit committee. l In Oudsthoorn - where the municipality's former executive mayor Jeffrey Swartbooi, of the Independent Democrats, was expelled for his involvement in an irregular tender contract - alleged corruption was brought to Bredell's attention by the acting municipal manager. ""I immediately instructed the SIU to assist the Oudtshoorn municipality. ""The investigation is underway and an outcome is not yet available,"" said Bredell. l At the Theewaterskloof municipality, allegations of irregular tender procedures and the sale of property in Middleton, Grabouw, Greyton, and the Caledon Airfield Development were investigated by the SIU. The Special Investigating Unit also probed allegations of irregular appointment of contractors on housing projects in Caledon. It found that there were no service level agreements and no supporting docu- ments for transactions, among others. l At the Witzenberg municipality the SIU was asked to identify and investigate irregular transactions relating to funding amounting to R860 000. ""In the coming year, the department will conduct a Fraud and Ethics Survey for 29 local and district municipalities. ""It will also conduct a two-day workshop with 11 municipalities to assist with the implementation of fraud prevention plans.

""Corruption has become endemic in our society and needs to be rooted out. This much must be clear. We are undeterred in our resolve to eradicate this plague, which is so debilitating to society at large,"" he said. Collaboration with the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) had netted 1 570 government officials abusing the low-income housing subsidy scheme. Of those caught, 1 189 were charged and convicted, and the government had recouped about R38m in the process. Sexwale told MPs five lawyers had been struck off the roll for their involvement in housing fraud, and he expected other corrupt lawyers to suffer the same fate. Sexwale said the SIU was working with the auditor-general's office and the national and provincial housing departments to identify corrupt officials. ""The team is hard at work tracking down those responsible for corruption, abuse and malpractices,"" he said. Sexwale also announced that since he became minister, his department had saved millions by cutting back on travelling (R20.6m), advertising (R24.4m), operational expenditure (R53.2m), administrative fees (R3.3m) and freezing posts that were considered not to be critical (R31m). He said the department had also saved R34m by reducing transfers of funds to institutions it administers. ""We have also looked at not necessarily filling vacant posts - yet without undermining service delivery. These posts will remain vacant until proper realignment has been done, in line with our new human settlements mandate,"" he said. Business class travel was banned and the number of officials who travelled was reduced, as were subsistence allowances. An initial assessment of the 2009/10 expenditure showed the department had saved R53.2m in operational expenditure, including R20.6m saved through less travel and subsistence allowances for travelling officials, R24.4m saved by cutting down on advertising and R3.3m saved in administrative fees. It emerged in November last year that the department had overspent its advertising budget by R40m and that R22m of that was pumped into a housing awareness play called A re ageng Mzanzi (Let's build South Africa), commissioned by former housing minister Lindiwe Sisulu. A war of words erupted between the two ministers after Sexwale cancelled the production and told a Gauteng-based talk radio station: ""I have no time for plays."" A fuming Sisulu blasted him in an angry statement - which was later blamed on her spokesman - saying Sexwale had failed to come up with new programmes and was claiming credit for initiatives she introduced. Since taking office, former businessman Sexwale has led from the front, flying economy class and eschewing government-issued vehicles, preferring to use his own cars. Responding to Sexwale's budget speech, the DA alerted him to information the party had obtained to the effect that the acting CEO of the National Home Builders Registration Council - an agency responsible for preventing shoddy workmanship in the building of houses - had entered into a R78m contract with the Gauteng Housing Department to build 1 431 RDP houses. Sexwale urged DA housing spokesman Butch Steyn to bring evidence of corruption to him. He said he would take up the matter with the council's board."680,Cape Times (South Africa),4/27/2010,Countering corruption is all about balancing foes with friendly felons,E1 Edition,UNITED STATES (79%),Pg. 9,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,684 words,FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION (57%),26-Apr-10,,FELONIES (90%); CORRUPTION (89%); JOURNALISM (78%); PRESS CONFERENCES (78%); FOREIGN POLICY (73%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (72%); ROBBERY (71%); BANK ROBBERY (70%); WRITERS (69%); RURAL COMMUNITIES (67%); HEDGE FUNDS (54%); MUSHROOM PRODUCTION (54%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (50%),"SOME YEARS ago, as a parliamentary scrounger after news, I was summoned to a press conference in the sacred hall;. My fallible recollection is that in a dingy cupboard on a tripod awaited Willie Hofmeyr, excited as a basset with a new bone. He and his legion of ferrets were planning to set up special units to sniff out the affairs of criminal swine and steal back what these bastards had stolen in the first place. In time Willie became the head of both wings of an FBI-style gangbuster operation. This made him a feared figure in the dark hearts of felons who had previously shielded their misdeeds from scrutiny - whether as bank robbers; people stealers; managers of hedge funds reporting to Goldman-Sachs; and even illegal mushroom growers such as my smelly neighbour Gatvol van der Pomp (Order of the Cold Bath). A scary event. One asked: would it even be possible for admired members of community-based associations - the 27s, 28s, 29s, etc - to put aside personal interests and take command of altruistic outfits like the Girl Guides, the Office of the Presidency (street address: Lot 5b, Stikland Meat Market) and the Rondebosch Bowling Club & Massage Parlour? Who exactly would leave behind content and idleness for the rarefied air of high office? Hofmeyr's looming shadow cast a volcanic blur over the green sprigs of our nascent democracy. The nation shivered as it went about hoarding unreturned library books, stealing electricity from looping pylons and winning tenders for building bridges made from wet cigarettes in rural areas. In time, though, the sombre, granitic, swivelling features of Willie - not unlike those of the truly famous extraterrestrial in Steven Spielberg's movie - seemed everywhere. His eyes were as blazing beams penetrating the rattiest recesses in quest of wrongdoing. Then when he found it, he pounced: snatching up illegal Jacuzzis, impounding decorative peacocks, tortoises and Mercs in the shady lanes of scumlord estates in Bishopscourt. By air, land and sea his minions swept out filth. Fearless, his tentacles tugged fatty wallets from the corrupt. Naturally he made enemies. But unlike the esteemed dwarf J Edgar Hoover, he failed to balance his foes with some friendly felons in government. Recall that Hoover made sure he could never get fired by keeping secret records, pics and diaries about such egregious politicos as JFK (the Don Juan of Washington) and LBJ (who once explained foreign policy to a journalist while peeing on a grave). They wanted to cut Hoover's twirling legs off, but never knew how much he knew. And it was ""Tricky Dicky"" Nixon's chief of staff, Charles Colson, who summed up the very nature of power with the pithy aphorism: ""If you have them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow."" Willie really did not bear this in mind. So he has let himself and us all down. He has been axed from one wing of his foggy legal pursuits while left with the other - and what bird can fly on one wing? He can no longer go it alone - taking away free movie tickets and meal vouchers from MPs who put racehorses down as expenses and eat them if they come last. And it seems he now has to report directly to the chief induna. He also has to approach the King on all fours, licking the dust and woofing plaintively. Yet - as always in in our plucky land - some good has emerged from the general shake-up of our ancient judicial system. Someone called Jeremy Gauntlett will not be allowed to become a judge. No such luck for him; perhaps he can run a weekly 15-minute law focus on eNews, or judge beauty contests in the North-East-by-West Province. The road to legal omniscience is now clear for (whom else?) Gatvol van der Pomp. While he awaits the call to fame, my drunk neighbour will be tending his mushrooms. Especially the ones with red dots up their smooth, faintly oily stems. They say that if you eat them (preferably with bacon, fried eggs and polony) you receive strange visions of the future in which Fifa soccer balls plus logo deck the halls of folly, in exchange for politicians selling their buddies short. I certainly believe it."681,Cape Times (South Africa),5/7/2010,SABC calls in Special Investigating Unit to probe corruption and mismanagement allegations,E2 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (92%),NEWS; Pg. 3,CT,Newspaper, Siyabonga Mkhwanazi Political Bureau,ENGLISH,488 words,,7-May-10,"JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA (57%)",INVESTIGATIONS (94%); CORRUPTION (91%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); BROADCASTING INDUSTRY (90%); PUBLIC BROADCASTING (89%); EXECUTIVES (89%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (89%); MISCONDUCT (78%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (77%); CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (74%); HUMAN RESOURCES (71%); PUBLIC FINANCE (71%); APPOINTMENTS (69%),"HEADS may roll at the SABC as the public broadcaster's new board, chaired by Ben Ngu-bane, has roped in the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) to investigate allegations of corruption and financial mismanagement amounting to hundreds of millions of rand. SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago said yesterday that a team of investigators from the SIU, headed by state crime-buster Willie Hofmeyr, started work at the Auckland Park head office in Johannesburg, on Monday. Their probe was expected to continue for the next few months. Kganyago said the new board had felt the expertise of the SIU was needed to help investigate outstanding cases identified by the Auditor-General in his report on the embattled corporation last year. The Auditor-General's probe was at the request of the National Assembly's committee on communications, prompted by a dossier of alleged wrongdoing by senior officials submitted by communication unions. That investigation led to the suspensions of senior officials, including chief financial officer Robin Nicholson, head of audience services Anton Heunis, head of procurement Mabela Satekge and former head of content enterprises Mvuzo Mbebe. Nicholson and Heunis were given final written warnings by a disciplinary committee, while Satekge's hearing continues. Mbebe, whose disciplinary hearing had yet to be concluded when his contract expired two months ago and was not renewed, has since taken the public broadcaster to court. He is arguing that he should no longer be subjected to the hearing as he is no longer an employee of the corporation. Kganyago said the SIU would follow up on all the issues raised by the Auditor-General and submit recommendations to the board. ""They will focus on issues of corporate governance, commercial enterprises, content enterprises, financial systems and human resources policies and procedures... in relation to compliance with the Public Finance Management Act,"" said Kganyago. He said the board had set no timeframe for the SIU but he hoped the probe would be finalised in the next few months. Kganyago said there were cases, arising from the Auditor-General's recommendations, which had been reported to the police. It was up to the police to act on the information against the implicated individuals. The chairman of the communications committee, Ismail Vadi (ANC), welcomed the decisive step taken by the board. ""From the time of the Auditor-General's report the committee has insisted that they proceed on outstanding matters. ""If it warrants a criminal investigation the law enforcement agencies must proceed. The fact that the (SIU) is investigation is on is a positive thing,"" said Vadi. Recently, the SABC suspended former acting group chief executive officer Gab Mampone on allegations of misconduct. Mampone, who returned to his position of group executive for commercial enterprises early this year when Solly Mokoetle was appointed the CEO, was suspended in February."683,Cape Times (South Africa),5/28/2010,Vavi hits out at Zuma for not acting on corruption,E2 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (79%),NEWS; Pg. 6,CT,Newspaper, CARIEN DU PLESSIS Political Bureau,ENGLISH,423 words,CONGRESS OF SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE UNIONS (93%),28-May-10,"CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA (77%)",INVESTIGATIONS (91%); CORRUPTION (91%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (78%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (77%); WEALTHY PEOPLE (71%); FAMILY COMPANIES (69%); HOTELS & MOTELS (55%),"COSATU general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi has hit out at President Jacob Zuma and his cabinet for not taking ""decisive action"" against ""corrupt"" ministers.

He said Communications Minister Siphiwe Nyanda, who spent half a million rands staying in luxury hotels in Cape Town while his official residence was being renovated, should also be investigated. ""There have also been allegations that he used his position to unfairly get tenders for his companies, and this needs to be investigated,"" Vavi said. Nyanda is said to own a 50 percent stake in GNS (General Nyanda Security) Risk Advisory Services, which has at least five contracts with government agencies. It has been alleged that with some, proper procedures were not followed. Asked whether he thought Zuma was hesitant to act against ministers because he might feel compromised because of his own or his family's business dealings, Vavi said: ""I don't know, but we expect him to act like a leader."" Zuma had promised repeatedly that corruption in government would be dealt with decisively. This was also one of the ANC's key election promises. Vavi said Cosatu's central executive committee had ""reaffirmed its determination to fight relentlessly ... the cancer of corruption"". ""Corrupt individuals"" would be targeted. ""The central executive committee expressed regret that the government had not inspired confidence through more decisive action against people perceived to hold power in government,"" he said. He said allegations that his wife Noluthando's business dealings with SA Quantum constituted a conflict of interests for him as Cosatu leader and spokesman were a deliberate attempt by ""tenderpreneurs"" to smear him. Vavi also spoke out against a ""new tendency"" by ""a faction without any particular political ideology"" to take control of the movement ""for its narrow programme of accumulation of personal wealth"".

The investigation, one of the biggest the unit has undertaken in recent years, was announced by Human Settlements Minister Tokyo Sexwale in Pretoria yesterday. It was also announced that the National Home Builders' Registration Council, the country's consumer watchdog body for the home building industry, was being investigated. Both Sexwale and SIU head Willie Hofmeyr said corruption and fraud in provincial governments and municipalities was ""endemic"", with corrupt officials abusing the housing subsidy. Sexwale said that of 7 353 government officials identified by the auditor-general for suspected subsidy fraud, 930 had been arrested, 761 were found guilty and R21.7 million was recovered. He said the SIU identified an additional 25 689 civil servants suspected of subsidy fraud, of whom 634 were arrested, 385 found guilty and R15.4m was recovered. At municipal level, the auditor-general had ordered that 6 974 council officials be investigated, of whom 346 were arrested, 151 found guilty and R7m was recovered. Of these, 76 cases were still pending, the department's director-general, Thabane Zulu, said. In total, 1 910 crooked officials had been arrested for unlawfully receiving housing subsidies, while 1 297 were successfully prosecuted. Zulu said disciplinary proceedings against the officials were under way and that more arrests were expected in the next few weeks in connection with several syndicates after three arrests were made in KwaZulu-Natal. These involved an attorney, who had been charged with 142 counts of fraud, while a contractor and an engineer were facing two criminal charges for defrauding the KwaZulu-Natal Human Settlements Department of R10m, said Zulu. He said 40 contractors would be restricted from doing business with the government. Zulu said political office- bearers were also involved. Regarding the unit's investigation of 20 contractors, Hofmeyr said the R20 million it received from the department would be used to employ 50 investigators, lawyers and data analysts. Hofmeyr said in many cases the government had ""been taken for a ride"" by contractors with the collusion of public servants. ""The average contract we are talking about here is R100m per contract so we |are not talking about small amountsí¢[#x20ac]_ fairly large companies are involved."" Hofmeyr believed that most contractors being investigated would face criminal charges, hence ""a very thorough investigation is required"". Sexwale said: ""We are very determined and steadfast in our campaign to fight corruption, so the crackdown does not cease and our resolve does not change. I wished that what we are going to present would be the end of the story, but in our country corruption is so endemic. ""It's spreading so much that it disturbs one to say that this is not the last presentation..."" He said the department and Hofmeyr's unit were working closely with Parliament and the office of the auditor-general to root out corruption. ""We want to send a message."" Also of concern was an increase in the number of housing syndicates operating mainly in Gauteng, North West and KwaZulu-Natal, where sophisticated criminal groups sold and rented state-owned houses with the help of government officials. Sexwale said a lot more ""finesse"" was needed to investigate the syndicates."695,Cape Times (South Africa),8/25/2010,Bold new|alliance|against|corruption,E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (94%),NEWS; Pg. 4,CT,Newspaper, Carien du Plessis Political Bureau,ENGLISH,453 words,,24-Aug-10,"JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA (92%); PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA (92%)",CORRUPTION (91%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (90%); AGREEMENTS (90%); MAGISTRATES (89%); JUDGES (89%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (77%); ASSET FORFEITURE (76%); RURAL COMMUNITIES (72%); APPROVALS (72%); INVESTIGATIONS (71%); SPORTS & RECREATION (70%) News.SouthAfrica,"FOUR of the country's top corruption-busting units have met to thrash out the details of a closer co-operation agreement to clamp down on corruption, Justice Minister Jeff Radebe has said. He revealed to journalists during an ANC briefing at Liliesleaf Farm in Johannesburg yesterday that the Hawks, the National Prosecuting Authority, the Asset Forfeiture Unit and the Special Investigations Unit met in Pretoria yesterday to finalise the ""model"" of their multidisciplinary anti-corruption task team, which was likely to be announced next month. He added that dedicated - and highly praised - World Cup courts were to be converted to hear and fast-track corruption cases. He said he had signed a performance agreement with President Jacob Zuma on the matter. One of the targets of the Asset Forfeiture Unit would be to convict at least 100 people with combined assets of more than R5 billion by 2014. ""There is a problem in South Africa that there is a lack of will to deal decisively and effectively with corruption in the system,"" he said, adding that corruption within the police and courts would also be urgently addressed. Radebe also said more judges would be needed to staff the country's revamped, more accessible courts in future. He said more judges would soon be needed in provinces like Mpumalanga, Limpopo and the North West when high courts were brought closer to rural areas, but any new appointments would need to be included in the department's mid-term budget first. Radebe also revealed that steps were already under way which would put the administration of the courts entirely in judicial hands, as anticipated in the Superior Courts Bill, which was approved by the cabinet in May and which still has to be discussed in |Parliament. ""We have seconded more personnel to the office of the Chief Justice (Sandile Ngcobo) to help judges to administer their own courts. ""This will require more personnel and more judges,"" he said. When the bill first saw the light in 2006, it caused a storm, as it put the administration of courts, including finances and the assignment of cases, in the hands of the department. Judges protested, as they saw this as an assault on the independence of the judiciary. The bill makes the Chief Justice responsible for the running of the country's courts, including the magistrate's courts, and it rationalises the composition, areas of jurisdiction and structures of the superior courts. It also did away with ""artificial distinctions"" between judges and magistrates, Radebe said. These would, in future, be known as high court judges and lower court judges. Radebe said the ANC's views on the transformation of the judiciary were based on the constitution, and did not differ from it."696,Cape Times (South Africa),9/22/2010,Courageous top officials can help fight against corruption in public entities,E1 Edition,UNITED KINGDOM (93%),Pg. 13,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,823 words,,21-Sep-10,,CORRUPTION (92%); INVESTIGATIONS (91%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (89%); POLITICS (89%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); DEFENSE SPENDING (76%); DEFENSE INDUSTRY (75%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (73%); THIS DAY IN HISTORY (64%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (59%) Opinion,"Patricia de Lille's name has become synonymous with fighting corruption. Her shift to the benches of the Western Cape provincial legislature will certainly leave a vacuum in the National Assembly. For it was De Lille who arrived at the opening of Parliament in 2000, wearing a sweater emblazoned with the words: ""The arms deal is out of my hands."" By eschewing the fancy attire of her fellow MPs, De Lille focused attention on the multibillion-rand deal. At the time the defence procurement package was off the radar of the majority of citizens. Today more than 10 years later, the arms deal of 1999 is mostly equated with corruption, inducements and conflicts of interest. At the height of the joint investigative team's investigation into the arms deal, Idasa said that the way in which our institutions and politicians dealt with allegations of corruption surrounding the deal would be a ""litmus test"" for our democracy. Our institutions of democracy were severely tested as political pressure mounted on the investigative authorities and on Parliament to make the allegations go away. The chair of the standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) charged with monitoring public expenditure, Gavin Woods, found himself unexpectedly in the political hot seat. The arms deal investigation set in motion a process that would tear Scopa asunder and would eventually lead to both Woods and Andrew Feinstein's resignation. Scopa has never quite recovered, though under the current chairmanship of Themba Godi it is hesitantly trying to find its feet many years on. So recently it felt like a blast from the past when Scopa was briefed by head of the Hawks Anwa Dramat on the ongoing investigation into the unanswered questions regarding corruption in the arms deal. The elite Scorpions, replaced by the Hawks, were another indirect casualty of the politics related to the arms deal. For years since the investigative team's report, rumblings of further investigations have been doing the rounds but no one, not even the most optimistic among us, believed that there was any serious appetite for the controversial investigation to be reopened. The essence of Dramat's presentation was that the Hawks lacked the capacity both financially and otherwise to pursue the investigation. There were more than million documents in relation to the alleged acts of corruption in relation to the BaE and German Frigate Consortium deals which needed to be sifted through. One person has been assigned to do so. Sifting through the documents, he said, would take about three years. Only then might decisions about further charges be made. In addition, the British and German governments were not being as co-operative as they might. In a supreme act of first world hypocrisy it was in fact Tony Blair who shut down the UK Serious Fraud Office investigation into BaE's involvement in the arms deal. Scopa seemed dissatisfied with some of Dramat's assertions, yet what is to be done? Given the scars it still carries from the last investigation, it is highly unlikely that Scopa will again open up this Pandora's box. Dramat told the committee that he had not had discussions with the president about the matter. The allegations of corruption into the arms deal reach uncomfortably to the highest echelons of government. The president himself has been tainted by his association with the corrupt Schabir Shaik. President Zuma's political position will always be precarious for as long as his name has not fully been cleared of corruption charges which were levellled at him. Societies sink further and further into indifference about corruption when leaders are unable to lead with conviction because they themselves are too tainted by allegations. Scopa is caught between a rock and a hard place. For no matter how good its intentions are, it was compelled to defer to Dramat's assessment of the situation: too much paperwork, too little money and capacity to take this further. Dramat did not say this explicitly, but it was implicit in his briefing. But if Dramat's presentation to Parliament was disheartening, then Cheryl Carolus's detailed briefing to the same committee two weeks ago on the steps SAA was taking to deal with the acts of fraud and mismanagement by former CEO Khaya Ngqula was a copybook example of what a briefing to Parliament should look like. It also made one wish that there were more bold board chairs of parastatals like Carolus. Tough and direct, Carolus does not suffer fools and one gets the feeling that there will be no safe haven for corruption within SAA. Carolus has that rare commodity that creates integrity in public life - courage. It is a commodity in short supply in many of our public institutions and without it the arms deal and other such deals tainted by corruption will continue to haunt us and undermine our efforts to create a just society. l February is manager of Idasa's Political Monitoring and Information Service."697,Cape Times (South Africa),9/29/2010,Cosatu to step up anti-corruption campaign,E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (94%),NEWS; Pg. 5,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,468 words,CONGRESS OF SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE UNIONS (84%),28-Sep-10,,CORRUPTION (94%); ELECTIONS (89%); LABOR UNIONS (78%); POLITICAL PARTIES (78%); STRIKES (78%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (78%); POLITICS (76%); INTERVIEWS (76%); NATIONALIZATION (75%); LIBERALISM (73%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (60%) News.Politics,"Vavi also said the labour federation would step up its campaign against corruption by building an anti-corruption institution of civil society, or ""corruption watch"", to fight the scourge.

Parliament could not vote on the Municipal Systems Amendment Bill, which among other things aims to professionalise municipal management, because 231 out of 400 MPs went awol yesterday. This left the House with 32 members short of a 50 percent plus one voting quorum. All parties participated in a debate on the bill, but when it came time to vote, DA chief whip Ian Davidson pointed out to deputy Speaker Nomaindia Mfeketo that the chamber looked pretty empty. An electronic count soon revealed that 231 MPs were absent. To make matters worse, yesterday was the last scheduled sitting of the National Assembly until April 12. And next week has already been set aside for committee meetings. If the ANC wants the bill passed and enacted before municipal elections on May 18, a special sitting of the National Assembly will have to be arranged for next week. Those MPs who will not already be in Cape Town for committee meetings will now have to make their way back to the Mother City - at taxpayers' expense - from their constituencies across the country to vote on the bill. Hailed by the government as a ""ground-breaking event for local government"", the bill will make it illegal for political-office bearers to serve as municipal managers - or managers who report directly to municipal managers, such as chief financial officers. The bill defines ""political office"" as any position of chairperson, deputy chairperson, secretary, deputy secretary, treasurer or any equivalent position - irrespective of what the party chooses to call such a post. It also gives the Minister of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Sicelo Shiceka, the discretion to prescribe the set of ""skills, expertise, competencies and qualifications"" required to manage a municipality. And the minister will be required to keep track of disciplinary actions taken against municipal managers to avoid those found guilty of unlawful conduct offering their services to other, unsuspecting, local councils. If a manager is found guilty of an offence, he or she will be prohibited from being employed at any municipality for the next 10 years. Opposition parties have broadly welcomed the new law. However, the ID and Cope warned that only time would tell if political parties had the necessary will to enforce the bill, while the DA said the law did not go far enough to depoliticise the management of municipalities. Acting Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Nathi Mthethwa - Minister Shiceka has been off sick since early this month - said yesterday the bill would change the way municipalities were run. ""Our view was that local government is functional, but there are critical areas that require our urgent attentioní¢[#x20ac]_ We have realised that some municipalities, regardless of the political party in leadership, are staffed by employees who are not qualified to undertake their duties,"" he said. ""The days of appointing bookkeepers, teachers and social scientists as chief financial officers (at municipalities) are over,"" he added. Mthethwa emphasised that the bill was not aimed at micro-managing municipalities from Pretoria, but that certain steps had to be taken to improve municipal management and services. DA MP and local government spokesman James Lorimer said the bill ""ticks a number of boxes about what is wrong in municipalities"", but suggested it did not go far enough. He joined a number of other opposition parties in blaming the ANC's cadre deployment policy as the cause of weak management at many municipalities. ""Are there other people outside the ranks of the ruling party who could help put these dysfunctional municipalities back together? Yes. Are they likely to be appointed? No. Thus you can have all the rules you want, but if you don't have the people who are able to carry out the work, nothing will get fixed,"" he said. ID parliamentary leader Joe Mcgluwa said the fact that such a bill was required at all ""demonstrates the consequences of the ANC's cadre deployment policy across the country"". ""While we welcome this bill we think that what is also required is for the ANC to finally end in its entirety this devastating policy of cadre deployment,"" he urged. Freedom Front Plus MP Pieter Groenewald went further, saying ""if local government was a patient, it would be lying on its deathbed"". Mthethwa acknowledged that the ANC had ""made mistakes"" in some instances, but denied that cadre deployment was the source of the problem."703,Cape Times (South Africa),3/31/2011,Corruption bombshell,E2 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (94%),NEWS; Pg. 1,CT,Newspaper, Deon de Lange Political Bureau,ENGLISH,552 words,,2-Apr-11,"PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA (94%)",INVESTIGATIONS (93%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); POLICE FORCES (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); OFFICE PROPERTY (76%); PROPERTY LEASES (76%); RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY (76%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (76%); RESIDENTIAL RENTAL PROPERTY (76%); RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION (76%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (73%); PUBLIC HOUSING (73%); SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES (72%); HOUSING ASSISTANCE (72%); COMMERCIAL RENTAL PROPERTY (71%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (66%); INFRASTRUCTURE (64%) News.Politics,"THE Special Investigating Unit (SIU) yesterday provided a rare glimpse into rampant corruption in the government when it told Parliament that 16 departments and public entities were under investigation for fraud, corruption and maladministration. National police commissioner Bheki Cele, who is already under fire for his role in a multibillion-rand headquarters lease in Pretoria, faces new questions after the SIU revealed that the construction of 33 police stations - valued at more than R330 million - was under investigation for ""significant irregularities"". The SIU has prioritised investigations into the Pienaar, Hazyview, Brighton Beach and eSikhawini police stations after an initial probe revealed fraud and corruption that included SAPS officials having undeclared interests in suppliers awarded work by the police; the lowest quotations not being accepted; no quotations received from winning bidders; and actual payments far exceeding budgeted costs. SIU chief Willie Hofmeyr told visibly shocked MPs from the National Assembly's justice committee yesterday that more than half of the government's approximately 10 000 subsidised housing projects were suspect. This included instances where ""contractors were paid for building houses which may not exist at all; were extensively incomplete; seriously defective; or were paid for more houses than were built"". He said the investigation by public protector Thuli Madonsela into the Pretoria and Durban police office leases was ""only one part of a far wider investigation"" into the police's procurement division. So widespread is corruption at this department that the SIU has been forced to prioritise only the 20 ""top cases"", which alone total over R2 billion. At the SABC the SIU uncovered that between September, 2007 and March last year, about 20 employees had undeclared interests in firms that did business with the broadcaster to the tune of R2.4bn. This follows an earlier auditor-general investigation that uncovered corruption involving 20 SABC employees to the tune of R3.4m. According to Hofmeyr, a joint investigation with the Brixton commercial crimes unit had so far resulted in eight criminal cases, of which five had been referred to the National Prosecuting Authority. ""There is serious criminality that is being investigated at the SABC,"" said Hofmeyr. The Department of Public Works is being investigated after the SIU discovered that R35m had been paid to entities in which department officials had undisclosed business interests. A contract issued by this department for the construction of ""accommodation"" at an undisclosed border post - valued at R375m - was also under the microscope. The public protector has already slammed Public Works Minister Gwen Mahlangu-Nkabinde for ""unlawfully"" entering into the police headquarters lease in Pretoria. Now the SIU is looking into another Pretoria lease, this time for a single residence which the department had leased as ""residential accommodation"" at an astronomical R217 000 a month - without ""relevant approval"". The contractor had been ""positively linked to a DPW official"". The Department of Arts and Culture is being probed for misusing funds ring-fenced for the 2010 World Cup.

Further procurements of R80m were also under investigation. Ten waste management tenders at the Ekurhuleni Metro - valued at R500m and involving 19 different contractors - were under investigation. In one of these, payments totalling R37.8m had been made to service providers without delivery notes and no one at the metro could confirm whether the goods were ever delivered. Also in Ekurhuleni, information and communication technology contracts worth R32m had been awarded to a company with which the municipality's executive director of IT services had an undisclosed relationship. ""He has since resigned and is now employed full-time by the company,"" Hofmeyr said to astonished gasps from MPs. And the municipality's director of infrastructure had admitted to approving invoices valued at R12.4m for services that were never delivered. The Department of Rural Development and Land Reform is being probed - at the request of minister Gugile Nkwinti - in what is likely to be the country's biggest-ever ""data uplifting project"". So far, fraud and corruption charges have been laid against three officials and a KwaZulu-Natal businessman relating to land reform grant fraud totalling R50m. And working with the Hawks and the Assets Forfeiture Unit, the SIU has seized KwaZulu-Natal farms worth a further R50m. The SIU can only investigate at the request of a department or government entity - and only after the president has signed a proclamation authorising such a probe. President Jacob Zuma has signed 16 proclamations for the 2010/2011 financial year, including one proclamation to investigate all 23 municipalities in North West. Asked by one MP whether South Africa was losing the fight against corruption, Hofmeyr said: ""I think we should all accept that corruption is a serious problem in our country, but I am hopeful that we will make good progress over the next few years."" He also said he was encouraged by the fact that the president had issued 16 SIU proclamations - the most in a single year - and that ""significant resources"" were being devoted to the problem."706,Cape Times (South Africa),4/1/2011,Corruption in|civil service no|surprise - Cosatu,E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (94%),NEWS; Pg. 4,CT,Newspaper, Deon de Lange Political Bureau,ENGLISH,489 words,CONGRESS OF SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE UNIONS (94%),3-Apr-11,,CORRUPTION (92%); INVESTIGATIONS (91%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); LEGISLATION (89%); CIVIL SERVICES (89%); POLICE FORCES (88%); HOUSING ASSISTANCE (78%); PUBLIC HOUSING (73%); SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES (70%); STATE OWNED BUSINESSES (69%) News,"COSATU has expressed shock - but not surprise - at the widespread corruption in the public service following reports that the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) is probing more than 16 government departments and public entities for fraud and corruption amounting to billions of rand.

Initial investigations have revealed that projects to build or renovate at least 33 police stations across the country have fallen victim to some form of fraud, corruption or maladministration. Hofmeyr also revealed that more than half of the government's 10 000 subsidised housing projects were suspect, a situation Cosatu described as ""blatant theft from the poor, who are being denied desperately needed houses and being forced to go on living in shacks"". ""We urge all workers to take heart from the strong stand being taken by the SIU and to report any acts of corruption and maladministration which they uncover at work. ""We demand that the authorities guarantee them protection from those they accuse,"" Craven said. He encouraged federation members to ""rally behind the SIU and government"" to rid the country of a ""culture of greed and self-enrichment at the people's expense"" and to build a public service ""which exists solely to serve the public"". Meanwhile, DA chief whip Ian Davidson has called on the ANC in Parliament to support a new bill his party proposed to the committee on private members' legislative proposals last week. The DA-sponsored law would prohibit government employees or their direct family members from owning more that 5 percent of any entity that does business with the government. It also recommends that any company wishing to do business with the government should provide an affidavit disclosing whether or not it is owned or part-owned by employees of the government. And it would require all public servants to periodically disclose their business interests in the same way that cabinet members are required to do. Since 1994, the ANC has blocked every significant legislative proposal by the opposition, in most cases citing the rule that allows such proposals to be rejected if the government itself plans to introduce similar legislation in the short term."708,Cape Times (South Africa),4/12/2011,"Cycle lane evidence of corruption by DA, says Ehrenreich",E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (79%),NEWS; Pg. 4,CT,Newspaper, Babalo Ndenze Metro Writer,ENGLISH,310 words,CONGRESS OF SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE UNIONS (94%),14-Apr-11,"CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA (73%)",CORRUPTION (93%); CITIES (90%); CITY GOVERNMENT (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); MAYORS (78%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (73%); INVESTIGATIONS (71%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (66%) News.SouthAfrica.WesternCape,"Cosatu provincial secretary Tony Ehrenreich has called for the City of Cape Town and the DA to be charged with corruption for ""spending public funds on their friends"" by constructing bicycle lanes in Blouberg.

Zille made the allegations in an election campaign speech in Heidelberg last week and posted the text on Facebook. Hessequa is one of the largest municipalities in the Western Cape, stretching from the Breede to the Gouritz rivers on the coast and taking in Witsand, Slangrivier, Heidelberg, Riversdal, Stilbaai, Albertinia and Gouritzmond. The ANC won it from the DA in the last municipal election. In her speech Zille charges that the Hessequa municipality is running out of money and will soon be unable to render services. And she says the mayor is corrupt because of a letter he wrote to local businesses earlier this year asking for donations to the ANC. She also makes comparisons with adjacent Mossel Bay, run by the DA - ""a municipality that works,"" she says. A row erupted in February when it surfaced that Hessequa mayor Chris Taute had written to businesses asking for donations, pointing out they had been awarded contracts by the ANC-run council. The DA, claiming the letter was an official council communication on a municipal letterhead, reported Taute to the Public Protector. Zille said it was unclear whether Taute had met the April 8 deadline to respond but it was ""likely he will drag this out until after the election so it does not hurt his chances of re-election"". Taute, who denies he used an official letterhead or threatened or tried to influence anyone into making donations, said he had replied to the Public Protector on time and was eagerly awaiting her response. He said his letter was in Afrikaans and the English translation was deliberately misleading. Also, he had used his own letterhead, designed himself on his own computer, which stated it was ""From the office of the Executive Mayor"". The official Hessequa letterhead was quite different. He said the Hessequa council was the first in the country to adopt an anti-corruption strategy and no councillor had ever been found guilty of corruption. Taute denied Zille's claim that Hessequa would have exhausted its capital reserve by next year, saying the council had in fact added R39 million to the fund in the current budget year. He said that while Mossel Bay had sold off all its assets and would have exhausted its capital reserve by 2013, Hessequa had a policy not to sell land under market value, to develop assets to earn sustainable revenue and to hold on to property until the market improved. Taute said he was mystified by Zille's statement that Hessequa ""could join other municipalities in the region which regularly scoop up awards for service delivery"" as Hessequa had already won the VUNA award for best public participation, the CAPE biodiversity award for environmental management and green vision and was rated 12th in the entire country by the Municipal IQ Survey which monitored local government. Mossel Bay was rated 16th. ""Interestingly, (DA Western Cape leader) Theuns Botha himself said recently that Hessequa is the best run municipality in the country. ""Perhaps Ms Zille should ask him why they have such opposing views or perhaps she is just misinformed,"" Taute said."713,Cape Times (South Africa),4/21/2011,DA councillors in Eden District guilty of corruption over vote bribe,E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (94%),NEWS; Pg. 7,CT,Newspaper, Neil Oelofse Garden Route Media,ENGLISH,461 words,,22-Apr-11,,BRIBERY (92%); CORRUPTION (91%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); VERDICTS (90%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (90%); CITY GOVERNMENT (89%); ELECTIONS (78%); DUE PROCESS (78%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (78%); WITNESSES (77%); TESTIMONY (77%); POLITICAL PARTIES (73%); CITIES (73%) News.SouthAfrica.WesternCape,"A disciplinary tribunal has found three DA councillors in Eden District guilty of corruption for trying to bribe an opposition councillor to vote for the DA in the fight for a top position two years ago. Disciplinary hearing prosecutor Anton de Swardt yesterday confirmed that DA district councillors Henry McCombi, Patrick Murray and Johan Koegelenberg had been found guilty of offering National People's Party councillor Anthony Ewerts R20 000 to vote for McCombi in an election of the council Speaker in 2009. De Swardt said a recommendation for the dismissal of the three councillors would be forwarded to the council. Asked for comment, the DA said it would challenge the guilty finding and the constitution of the disciplinary tribunal in the high court. The chief witness in the hearing was Deon Nomdoe, a former Eden official who was convicted of bribery in a criminal case and fined R6 000 for his involvement in the attempt to bribe Ewerts. Nomdoe said he was shown R20 000 in cash by Murray, Koegelenberg and McCombi and told to offer it to Ewerts in exchange for his vote. ""They said I must tell him there is a certain way he must draw his cross on the ballot,"" Nomdoe said. Nomdoe also played to the hearing a recording of what he said was a conversation between him and McCombi, in which McCombi had revealed that he had discussed the alleged bribe with DA Western Cape leader Theuns Botha. On the tape, McCombi tells Nomdoe that Botha had got a big fright when he learned that money had been involved. McCombi said Botha had expressed disbelief, to which McCombi had said ""there was really money involved in this thing"". McCombi also advised Nomdoe to resign before he could be brought before a disciplinary hearing, warning that he would be ""torn apart"". Nomdoe has since been included on the ANC's candidate list for the upcoming municipal elections in George. Ewerts testified that Nomdoe had called him to his office on July 30, 2009 to show him the money. ""He showed me a plastic bank bag with R200 notes in. The rest of the money was in an envelope and he told me each of the two contained R10 000. He said if I drew my cross in a certain way, the DA would know that I had voted for councillor Henry McCombi."" Ewerts said he did not vote for McCombi and was not paid any money, but McCombi was still elected Speaker. Ewerts said it was later established that former ANC councillor Berenice le Roux had voted for McCombi, breaking the deadlock that had confounded a number of previous attempts to elect a Speaker. Botha described the disciplinary hearing as ""a lot of nonsense"" and an attempt to ""witch-hunt the DA"". He said the tribunal had been set up without due process.

The major challenge became capacity to implement the policies, decisions and strategic plans of government. The challenge manifested itself in the form of lack of management skills (strategic thinking, planning and management experience), shortage of specialised skills (engineers, etc) and general experience in running a local municipality. In this regard rural and remote municipalities suffered more than municipalities in the main cities since most skilled personnel preferred to work in urban areas. The challenge of capacity to implement was exacerbated by employment and deployment strategies which tended to be influenced by political considerations rather than ability to do the job. Unfortunately, our new democracy in some instances mixed up political deployment (at the level of elected political office bearers) and employment in specialised public service positions. This was understandable though in the light of the pervasive apartheid structures and institutions the new democratic government inherited. As a result the transformation of this system had unfortunately to be political and not based on skills and capacity in some instances thus affecting the capacity of the municipality to deliver services. The greatest challenge of all was corruption in all its manifestation. The employment of friends and members of one's political faction irrespective of skills and capacity, the choice of service providers on the basis of political considerations, friends and faction, who have no capacity to deliver the services they are contracted to deliver, tender allocations to companies which are not able to deliver the service but benefit those who make such decisions, and corrupt officials who steal and defraud the state and therefore the people. The one fatal mistake we made in this regard was to believe that the cadre moulded by the gallant struggle for liberation would be incorruptible when in government. There are three things that we missed. The first was the point that after sacrificing so much in their lives they would have an urge to live a normal life as well, like other citizens. Second, the material conditions that produced quality, selfless leaders, such as Oliver Tambo, Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Govan Mbeki, and many others, were radically different from the material conditions of those who have to run or work in government. In the struggle for liberation there was nothing to live for except making sacrifices (even unto death) to liberate the people from an evil apartheid system. In doing so there were no rewards except detention, torture, imprisonment or exile. Third, we also failed to understand that however idealistic comrades were and however much the struggle for liberation made them selfless and committed to the cause to liberate the people, the material conditions of being in government would change their character and personalities radically. Put simply, we failed to understand that comrades were just as human as any other human being. In this regard we must be vigilant and understand that it does not matter who is in power or employed in government, the material conditions there are bound to reshape them to behave just like any other human being. What we need is to create mechanisms to make this type of behaviour an aberration rather than the way of life. And this is the greatest challenge of our society today. We need to crowd out corrupt leaders, officials and business people who are collaborators in this crime against our people. We must make sure corruption does not pay by making their lives miserable and not leave them to live in comfort. The problem with corruption or corrupted systems is that they affect the poor more than they do the rich. The service delivery crises we face affects in the main poor communities. In a crisis situation rich people can always survive, but poor people die. When there is shortage of water poor communities go without water while rich communities turn to their boreholes. When there is no sewerage system rich people create such facilities for themselves, while poor people live with the risk of serious health hazards. When there is no electricity rich people generate their own electricity, while poor people survive by whatever means they can find. When electricity is turned off rich people's generators turn on, while poor people just go cold. It is thus not surprising that all service delivery protests take place in poor communities or where services are not available or not provided for. For a start we must accept that communities which are not given the quality services they deserve have a democratic right to engage in any form of protest, especially when they have exhausted all other avenues to remedy the situation. They are expected, though, to do so within the law as well as respect other people's rights. Based on my experience most service delivery protests relate to: 1) Failure of the council or government to deliver basic services. 2) Unnecessary or unexplained delays in delivering such services. 3) Failure of the councillors to interact with the community, keep them informed about what the council (or government) is doing about matters that affect them as well as involve them in some of the projects where it is possible. 4) Visible or known corruption cases which enrage the community especially when these are perceived as robbing them of their right to such services. There is another set of reasons for service delivery protests which are more complex and in some cases even unjustified. Some are part of the manifestation of corruption and unethical behaviour. These include protests triggered by one party to discredit another or one faction of a party against another as part of a power struggle. These struggles at times are about positions within the council or at higher levels. At other times they involve disputes about tenders or the quest to control the decision-making processes on tenders to benefit themselves. Often a legitimate course is used to achieve this objective. Although the motive might look unsavoury the course is legitimate from the community's perspective. There is one thing I feel very strongly about in relation to protests. One cannot express one's rights at the expense of the rights of others. I find it difficult to understand why people who are angry and protesting, destroy the products of poor street vendors and traders who have nothing to do with what they are protesting about. Nor does it make sense to stone cars along the highway because one is angry about one council or another in townships along those routes. There is nothing revolutionary about these acts except that they discredit the cause of the protesters. In fact I would like to submit that this behaviour is reactionary and counter-revolutionary. We need to ask ourselves what we can do as faith communities to make sure citizens of this country, especially the poor, get the services they deserve. The latent power of faith communities or churches, which has not been tapped, is their presence in every ward or community. I am sure there are many churches in Moqhaka Municipality in the Free State and in Khayelitsha who should have been the first ones to see the open toilets even before the projects were completed. These churches should have been the first to raise the alarm well before the politicians began to debate about them as a party political issue. If we are called to minister to the people we should be the first ones to make sure that: 1) People without proper documents (IDs, birth certificates, etc) have them. 2) People who deserve grants from government (old age, disability, children, etc) get them. 3) Where there is no proper sanitation the government is called upon to take care of it. 4) Where there is no water, the government should be called upon to take care of it. 5) Where a school is dysfunctional, the parents of that school and the education department should make sure it is functional. 6) Where a hospital or health facility is not providing proper health care services, that the hospital management and the health department be called upon to address the challenges. We have a responsibility and an obligation to the communities we live in and minister to. Religious communities have a tradition of offering emergency services to communities where governments failed to do so. We did this during the days of apartheid and there is no reason we cannot do it now. l Reverend Chikane, the former director general in President Thabo Mbeki's office, is president of the Apostolic Faith Mission International and a Visiting Adjunct Professor in the School of Public & Development Management at Wits University.

Of the 21 817 cases of social grant fraud Sassa has opened, 17 908 were brought to court between June 2005 and December 2010 - leading to 15 004 |convictions. Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini said in a written response to a parliamentary question from DA MP Patricia Kopane that each person found to have defrauded the social grant system signed an acknowledgment of debt and repaid it with interest of 15 percent. The repayments were managed by the Special Investigating Unit, which has for years been investigating fraud at the agency. The unit then pays the department, which in turn pays the funds to the Treasury. About 15 million citizens now receive support - from child care grants to disability grants and pensions - at a cost of R97.5bn this financial year. According to the response, KwaZulu-Natal suffered the highest losses due to corruption and fraud since 2005 (R88.9m), followed by the Western Cape (R34.9m), Gauteng (R28.6m), Mpumalanga (R24.2m), Eastern Cape (R18.46m), Limpopo (R14.98m) and North West (R13.9m). However, the amounts lost due to fraud and corruption have consistently decreased year-on-year in all provinces, except KwaZulu-Natal, where losses increased steadily, from R5.9m in 2005/06 to R14.2m in 2009/10, before rocketing to R25.8m in the last financial year to December alone. Correspondingly, KwaZulu-Natal leads the provinces with the highest number of social grant fraud cases reported: 5 390 since 2005. Gauteng follows with 3 340 cases, then the Eastern Cape (2 829), Limpopo (2 599), Western Cape (2 331), Mpumalanga (1 816) and North West (1 800). Dlamini said Sassa was implementing a more comprehensive anti-fraud strategy from this financial year, including closer working relationships with Home Affairs, law enforcement agencies and traditional leaders. ""The partnership has been useful in assisting Sassa to effectively identify, combat and prevent further social grant fraud,"" she said. She added that if a person defaulted on his or her repayment schedule, the defaulter was taken back to court, while the agency was also exploring the use of garnishee orders to prevent defaults and guarantee the recovery of the fraudulently paid grants. A total of R214m in acknowledgments of debt was outstanding as at December 31 last year, while R61.6m in interest was recoverable. Other attempts to boost the integrity of the system included ""continuous interrogation"" of data to pick out suspicious grants. Meanwhile, the 2011 Estimates of National Expenditure says the department is saving R870m, mostly in administrative expenses related to the payment of social grants. - Political Bureau"718,Cape Times (South Africa),6/10/2011,"What's a few dozen cases of fraud,corruption to a nation?",E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (94%),Pg. 10,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,611 words,,11-Jun-11,,CORRUPTION (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); MISCONDUCT (77%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (77%); INVESTIGATIONS (76%); ETHICS (75%); BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (66%); SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT (65%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (59%); APPOINTMENTS (50%) Opinion,"THE way some people are carrying on, you would swear we were a nation of thieves and con artists. And, unfortunately, such ugly insinuations are not just coming from the usual bunch of whingers. Last week, for instance, the Treasury issued a detailed set of instructions to all government departments and public entities as part of what it described as an attempt ""to improve transparency and combat fraud in institutions"". This is a completely over-the-top reaction to the instances of fraud and corruption that do occur here and there. For its part, the Treasury itself could identify only 120 companies it found to be unsuitable for doing business with the state. Out of how many? Thus, far from being confirmation of widespread skulduggery, the blacklisting of a mere few dozen companies shows instead that corruption is not quite as rampant as we are often told by the rumour-mongers. Yet, in its wisdom, the government has decided that tackling corruption is now one of its 12 key objectives. As a result, its departments and institutions will have to jump through even more hoops before it can spend amounts above a certain level. As if this were not enough, the Finance Ministry also established a Multi-Agency Working Group to investigate supply chain management practices linked to corruption. This is bureaucracy gone mad, and will no doubt result in serious under-spending. And surely under-spending is just as bad as over-spending. The result is pretty much the same: fewer resources to those who need it. What will make the situation even worse is the increasingly interventionist role of the Office of the Public Protector. Thuli Madonsela, by her own admission, made recommendations to various state entities since she took office two years ago. However, she recently moaned that certain state entities were deliberately ignoring these recommendations to implement remedial actions - ""even in cases of conduct failure, as in cases involving corruption, unethical conduct and abuse of power or of state resources"". This disregards the fact that, in the long run, such officiousness may paralyse the work of government and its various organs. As Bongi Luthuli of the SA Board of Sheriffs pointed out: ""We do not accept your report in total ... without being disrespectful, your report is not capable of being implemented."" But, once again, the powers that be are deaf to such protests. Instead, the Public Protector may be given even more teeth. A new set of rules is currently under discussion in government and may be finalised within a matter of months. Yet such attempts to appease the government's critics aren't good enough for the likes of the DA. It also wants government to take action even before there is any hard evidence of corruption. Take the case of Zanele Hlatshwayo, the former Msunduzi mayor recently appointed as a manager in the KwaZulu-Natal health department. The DA went ballistic: ""Msunduzi was brought to its knees by rampant maladministration and corruption. As former mayor and Exco chair, Hlatshwayo still has a great deal to answer for regarding her |disastrous tenure as political head of that municipality."" Fortunately, despite such hysterical outbursts, Hlatshwayo's position is safe. Thank heaven there are still some sensible folk out in the provinces, who don't all agree with the ANC's national leadership on the scale of corruption in South Africa, nor on how best to deal with it. This is bound to result in tension and infighting within the ANC. No doubt the DA will benefit most from this. Because while we do indeed have the occasional problem with corruption, it can't be quite as bad as the DA makes it out to be.

Human Settlements Minister Tokyo Sexwale said yesterday the woman, Vanessa Somiah, had been entrusted by the Special Investigating Unit (SIU), where she held a senior position as head of housing probes for the past five years, to investigate allegations of corruption within the NHBRC. It had now come to light that Somiah, during the investigation, had been offered or had applied for a senior post in the NHBRC, allegedly in collusion with the chief executive officer of the council, Sipho Mashinini, who was among those she was supposed to be investigating. Both are now being investigated by the SIU. Following the revelations, Mashinini had been given a final written warning pending an NHBRC board decision on whether the allegations against him warranted dismissal or possible legal action. Further allegations have been levelled against him, but the chairman of the NHBRC board, Vukile Mehana, said he could not elaborate as the matter was sub judice. Somiah, who is now employed by the NHBRC and earns R1.6 million - almost twice her salary at the SIU - is on special leave with pay. She is being investigated for conflict of interest and |corruption. Sexwale said he regarded this as ""not only devious, but also shocking to realise how some of those who are supposed to be in authority in our campaign against corruption can undertake such reprehensible measures to undermine this fight"". ""In my book, this is inducement and corruption. Bribery takes many forms and this is bribery,"" he said. The department had mandated the SIU to investigate corruption within the housing sector and it had been examining ""questionable"" housing contracts totalling R2 billion. Sexwale said it was clear that Somiah's report - which found that allegations of corruption could not be substantiated - was ""whitewashed""."720,Cape Times (South Africa),7/6/2011,Hats off to Cosatu's stand on corruption,E1 Edition,ZIMBABWE (92%),Pg. 9,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,737 words,CONGRESS OF SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE UNIONS (93%),7-Jul-11,,CORRUPTION (90%); MURDER (76%); CRIME RATES (76%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (76%); EMINENT DOMAIN (71%); LARCENY & THEFT (71%); NATIONALIZATION (67%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (59%); AFFIRMATIVE ACTION (52%) Opinion,"All power should go to Cosatu! Not only is the labour federation pronouncing often about rampant corruption in our country, but it is now forming an independent structure to fight the scourge. Indeed, corruption is threatening to overwhelm us and corrode every effort we might want to make to develop our society. In addition to the actual theft of public money and property, corruption does lead to the death and injury of people. The community demonstration that led to the murder of Andries Tatane in Ficksburg is traceable to corruption in that municipality. The death of a Zimbabwean national in Extension 75 in Seshego recently, and the injury of many others, had a corruption element. Residents say they had been complaining to the police and the municipality about a racket that has seen a lot of RDP houses occupied by Zimbabweans, either on rental or unknown basis. But nothing was done. As we all know, RDP houses are built for poor citizens of South Africa. Obviously, some people in positions of authority are illegally making money from the plight of both citizens and foreign nationals. The poor are put on a collision course with one another by the grubby hands of the connected. A rather daunting prospect is the possible descent of cynicism upon the population, an affliction that could drain us of all confidence in public affairs. Social cohesion disappears when most of us start looking askance at public initiatives and activities, suspecting corrupt motives at every turn. We have so far soiled every noble venture meant, ostensibly, to benefit society and the country. Just a few examples would do: Affirmative action, which is mandated by the constitution and geared towards rectifying the denial of skills and opportunities for the majority in our population, thereby deliberately impoverishing them, is being debased by only ""affirming"" friends, business partners and family members in a drive to loot public resources. This is so widespread in the public sector that it is no longer subtle. Crooked schemes are hatched to start businesses that would then tender for work that would be adjudicated by partners in theft. With crime levels so high in the country and policemen and women battling so hard to stem the ugly tide, who would begrudge them suitable headquarters from which to do their work? Who in his or her right mind would quibble with the need for them to have a police day set aside so that they could be recognised by management and have a bit of fun with their colleagues? But how are citizens supposed to feel when they learn that there are shenanigans in the provision of the headquarters of their police and in the arrangements relating to the celebration of police day? Were these initiatives conceived to serve the police or were they contrived in order to facilitate the rape of state resources? It is indeed tragic that such notions are planted in our heads. Nationalisation of mines and the expropriation of land are raised as some of the possible routes to take in our quest to build a more equal and just society. These are not trivial matters. They require a sober, honest and sincere debate by all of us. But there are already suggestions to the effect that those championing these routes with the shrillest of voices are motivated by gigantic greed. Although it is difficult for most of us to imagine anybody trifling with such weighty national issues in this way, it just goes to show how corruption can mess with the psyche of a nation. In circumstances where corruption rules, we would not be able to engage in any national projects in a serious and effective way. For instance, we would not be able to purposefully consider and take forward the work of the National Planning Commission in the absence of social cohesion and honesty in our public life. According to reports, Cosatu is so alarmed by the appalling low levels of ethical behaviour and morality in our society that it has decided to move beyond condemnation of corruption by establishing a structure to fight this demon. As I understand it, the labour federation is creating a stand-alone unit which would be tasked with monitoring corruption, receiving reports from whistle-blowers and passing these to the relevant authorities and exerting pressure, where necessary, to ensure that appropriate action is taken. Cosatu deserves national support for this commendable effort.

An initial contract had been awarded after a formal tender process, and an additional contract was awarded for work not included in the initial tender.

The State will have to pick up the hefty tab for storage and curator's fees - which earlier this year stood at R360 000. The former senior superintendent will get his assets back, including proceeds from the sale of his Umkomaas home, but he says they are ""virtually worthless"". While there is provision in law for the State to make good on this, he does not have the money, or the will, to continue fighting. Meyer, who is now farming near Klerksdorp, was once the blue-eyed boy of the KwaZulu-Natal police service. He fell from grace when he and others in his unit were charged with corruption. It was alleged that he had taken bribes from illegal casino owners in return for not raiding them or shutting them down. He was convicted in the Durban Regional Court of two counts of corruption and one of theft of furniture and sentenced to an effective 10 years. He was acquitted of all but the theft charge on appeal. He then began his fight for the return of his household goods, a Nissan Sani, a Jeep, a trailer, R86 000 from the house sale and R67 000 in interest. Unrepresented, he came to the Durban High Court last year, wanting the civil court - where the ""balance of probabilities"" test is less onerous than in a criminal court - to further clear his name. Acting Judge Fazal Moola did just that in a judgment handed down late last week. The judge said great reliance had been placed on the evidence of Meyer's ex-wife, Tokkie, who said during the trial that he had started bringing home large amounts of cash; the evidence of witnesses (the illegal casino owners) that he had received between R' 000 and R490 000 from them as protection money; and the evidence of investigating officer Herby Heap that Meyer was living beyond his legitimate means. Regarding Tokkie Meyer's evidence, the judge said it was common cause that there was animosity between her and Meyer because of his infidelity and their subsequent divorce. Her evidence was not only uncorroborated but was contradicted by the evidence of the witnesses he allegedly bribed, Judge Moola said. The judge could not find the affidavits of the illegal casino owners in the original forfeiture application papers. References to them by Heap were therefore ""hearsay evidence"". He said Heap had not conducted a full audit of Meyer's expenses and earnings. The items seized were the sort one would expect to find in an average household and there was nothing to suggest they were proceeds of illegal activities. ""Certain items, such as the Nissan Sani, raise certain suspicions, which would have justified a referral to oral evidence, but this has not been requested,"" he said. The judge directed the curator to return the property and the State to pay his fees and all associated costs. Meyer said he was pleased to have been exonerated again. While the goods were not worth much, ""the money will help"", he said. ""The judge could have ordered that the State return the goods in the same condition in which they were taken, but the judgment is silent on that.

Reading about corrupt government and ANC officials has become like reading about floods in Bangladesh. Is corruption really something that we as citizens should worry about? Could it be that there is a bit of a white conspiracy to show that blacks are a bunch of incompetent skelms? On your behalf, I've read the boring, repetitive news reports on corruption involving the South African government and ANC politicians, so let me give you a few recent highlights. I'll stick to the simple cases and not even refer to shady property deals involving the police, the Public Works Department and the Department of Justice or court cases in Kwazulu-Natal and Northern Cape involving senior provincial ANC leaders. Highlight 1: The German arms manufacturer Ferrostaal has not denied a German newspaper report last week that it had paid R300 million in bribes to South Africans to secure contracts to supply submarines to the tune of R5.4 billion. Highlight 2: Shortly before this revelation, the Swedish arms group Saab admitted that R24m had been paid to South Africans by its former partner, BAE Systems, to secure a deal involving 26 Gripen fighters. So now we know that at least R346m - I'll bet my bottom dollar the real amount was a lot higher - was paid to politicians and officials to lubricate the R60bn-plus arms procurement deals. Investigative reporters believe a sizeable chunk of this money was paid into the coffers of the ANC, which more or less guarantees that there will never be a proper investigation. Highlight 3: With the help of the investigations of City Press and the Mail & Guardian we also know that the president of the ANC Youth League, Julius Malema, is the director of the Ratanang Trust and that at least one businessman says he paid a large sum of money into this trust because Malema helped him to secure a state tender. We also now know that Ratanang Trust is a shareholder of On-Point Engineering, which is in charge of allocating Limpopo provincial government tenders worth more than R4bn. Just these three highlights should cause us grave concern that corruption and fraud could be in the process of becoming institutionalised, becoming the ""normal price of doing business with the state"". The argument gaining currency very fast is that these revelations are made by the media puppets of white monopoly capital in order to paint black politicians as lazy and corrupt. The only way for black people to make money is through the state, says columnist Eric Miyeni to great applause, clearly implying that tenderpreneurship is a legitimate way of securing ""economic liberation in our lifetime"". On radio and in print in the past week, Miyeni and Malema were the strongest voices demanding the speedy eradication of poverty. They stated that white theft and selfishness were the root of black poverty. That is the extent of the madness that is loose in our society. Some of those well-connected to the ruling party now believe they have licence to defraud and steal from the state in the name of black economic liberation. And they're not only getting away with it, they have elevated themselves to leading a crusade against ""white capital"" and white South Africans in general. The simple truth is that these tenderpreneurs are stealing not from the white rich but from the black poor. Every cent lost through corruption could have been spent on job creation projects, education, housing or health care. These self-styled ""champions of the new struggle for economic liberation"" are in reality the enemies of the poor. If they get their way and if they continue like they are, the poor will become poorer and there will be more of them. The official reaction to the growing corruption has been denial and empty assurances. As I write this, Malema is appearing before an ANC disciplinary hearing - but not to answer questions about his lifestyle as a multimillionaire with an average salary, nor about the Ratanang Trust and On-Point Engineering, but about a statement he made about Botswana. If the revelations about his private affairs are true, Malema should go to jail for a long time. But it is appropriate to remember that President Jacob Zuma had equally serious charges made against him, and these were dropped in a highly suspect way. Corruption in the name of liberating blacks and punishing whites is still only corruption. It will not liberate more than a handful of blacks and it won't only punish the whites."727,Cape Times (South Africa),8/30/2011,Corruption threatens our dream,E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (94%),Pg. 9,CT,Newspaper, Thabo Makgoba,ENGLISH,1555 words,,31-Aug-11,,RELIGION (90%); CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY (88%); CORRUPTION (87%); POLITICAL PARTIES (78%); PROTESTANTS & PROTESTANTISM (78%); POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS (75%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (75%); POLITICS (73%); RETIREMENT & RETIREES (72%); SOCIAL JUSTICE (69%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (50%) Opinion,"In the past, churches and faith communities shared a burning desire, with liberation movements, to replace apartheid with constitutional democracy. Now the challenge is how to make this transition into a practical reality for all South Africans. As the former UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan, has said: ""No one is born a good citizen; no nation is born a democracy. Rather, both are processes that continue to evolve over a lifetime."" In South Africa, we are still learning how to become a democracy, and still feeling our way into the new relationships appropriate to constitutional democracy. Government, political parties, the private sector, academia, the media, civil society, faith communities and so forth, now each have our distinctive contributions to make to the life of the nation as a whole. We are still learning where we should stand in solidarity, and where we should be critical; what it means to hold and to exchange legitimately diverse perspectives; and how to deliver and receive criticism that is constructive. The way to pursue such maturing democracy is to abide by our constitution. I want to look at what this means for all of us. As a faith leader, I firmly believe it when God says that people matter. God cares that his beloved children should all have adequate food, shelter, clothing and so forth. God cares that everyone should be treated with complete respect by everyone else, with no one marginalised, excluded or voiceless in the ordering of our common lives. This is what democracy is all about. As Anglicans we are in solidarity with the needs of the poorest, the most vulnerable, and the most marginalised; including the strangers, the foreigners, in our midst. We are in solidarity with available, affordable health care for all. We are in solidarity with effective rural development. We are in solidarity with education for all that truly equips our young people to be responsible citizens, able to face the challenges of adulthood. On the other hand, we are critical of a response to crime that leads to escalating deaths among both police and suspects. We are critical of inadequate social support, and of continuing delays faced by too many of the most needy, especially paperless orphans and pensioners - though I recognise that there are some improvements. We are, and you all should be, concerned with honour and respect, with freedom, with unity and diversity, with healing, with democratic values and social justice; with human rights, with quality of life and liberating potential, for every single one of us. To be subject to our constitution means to breathe life into these commitments to one another. We are here because many of us believe that corruption - in government and in business and in our communities - is endemic and is eating at the very moral fibre of our nation and its democratic values. Corruption threatens the dream of rooting out residues of apartheid and creating the South Africa we would all be proud of. That is what makes the Red Card Campaign an urgent and important effort. I call on all South Africans not only to sign the pledge but also to inscribe it in our daily lives. The pledge has two distinct and important parts: 1. It calls upon government to establish a strong, independent, anti-corruption body to investigate all acts of corruption and bring the perpetrators to justice; and 2. It calls upon us to pledge that we will neither take nor offer a bribe, and we will report any such incidents to the relevant authorities. But there is much more at stake here. The Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (CASAC), which has gathered us here, places before us a challenge: ""A complacent citizenry remains the greatest threat to our constitution. As responsible citizens we should assert our right to actively campaign for the realisation of rights enshrined in the constitution."" We in South Africa have a constitutional democracy for which so many struggled and for which many died. We cannot step back from doing what we can for the realisation of the rights promulgated in the constitution nor can we relinquish the responsibilities that come with democracy. An active and alert citizenry is foremost among those responsibilities. As we all lend our support and work for the public/common good, let us never tire of ""red-carding""|corruption. However, it is the responsibility of governments - more than any other body, and more than any other objective - to pursue the public good. In particular, government must prioritise the needs of those who are least able to achieve their own wellbeing - the poor, the marginalised, the disadvantaged, and the vulnerable. The Golden Rule calls us all to care for others as we would like to be cared for ourselves. It seems so simple and yet we experience it to be quite difficult at times. Indeed, the history of our country would be quite different if we had begun long ago to live by this rule. But there is nothing to stop us from making the ""golden rule"" our baseline in addressing corruption. Many South Africans acknowledge having offered or having been offered a bribe. Certainly, highly publicised examples of corruption and claims of corruption are the centre of conversation in many circles. As I said during the funeral of Mama Albertina Sisulu: ""We see examples of where many have used political power to enrich themselves and their relatives and friends, sometimes through blatant corruption - and so betray the legacy for which the Sisulu family has striven."" Beyond being illegal and immoral, when money is misused, its potential to be utilised in constructive and helpful ways is lost. Housing, education, health services and social development cry out as obvious examples where we can least afford this. Corruption also causes costs to escalate and often new programmes are sidelined. Money to employ badly needed personnel ""disappears"", and resultant understaffing leads to poor services, worsening results, and a continuing downward spiral. Corruption at this macro level is the point at which many people get most upset. But we must not forget corruption at the lower level. One can imagine situations involving traffic officers and speeding fines and other tickets where one might be tempted to cross the line. Corruption at a lower level - sometimes where the currency isn't even money, but dishonesty about work done or left undone - has an insidious effect on the type of society we are building, which seriously concerns me as a person of faith. The ability of us all, especially those who are most disadvantaged by society's injustices, to always ""do the right thing"" is further undermined when it seems that dishonesty by those in positions of power and influence goes unchecked and unpunished. Therefore, let us recall the words of the preamble to our constitution: ""We, the people of South Africa, recognise the injustices of our past; honour those who suffered for justice and freedom in our land; respect those who have worked to build and develop our country; and believe that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, united in our diversity ""We therefore, through our freely elected representatives, adopt this Constitution as the supreme law of the Republic so as to heal the divisions of the past and establish a society based on democratic values, social justice and fundamental human rights; to lay the foundations for a democratic and open society in which government is based on the will of the people and every citizen is equally protected by law; to improve the quality of life of all citizens and free the potential of each person; and to build a united and democratic South Africa able to take its rightful place as a sovereign state in the family of nations. May God protect our people."" These challenging but cherished words are not to be taken lightly nor forgotten. The task of making the preamble of our constitution a reality is considerable - but this cannot be a reason to side-step or seemingly ""redraft"" it. We must continue to press ahead together. We can take another important step forward with the Red Card Corruption campaign. Through this we can say an emphatic NO to corruption which slows our pace of development as a nation and weakens the moral fibre of individuals and society. Let us not forget the challenge CASAC has put clearly before us: ""The constitution is our social contract based on democratic values, social justice, human rights and the improvement of the quality of life of all South Africans. We cannot progress and prosper through greed. An act of corruption is a crime against us all."" We call upon the government to establish strong, independent, anti-corruption bodies that can investigate all acts of corruption and ensure those that those who commit corrupt acts are brought to justice. We must stand up, blow our whistles and Red Card Corruption. Please join me as we pledge together: ""I/we pledge neither to receive nor pay a bribe; and to report any attempt to solicit a bribe from me, and other corrupt activities to the relevant authorities."" l This is an edited version of the keynote address delivered by The Most Revd Dr Thabo Makgoba, Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town, at the launch of the Red Card Corruption campaign at Walter Sisulu Square, Kliptown, Soweto.

Madikizela on Wednesday announced he would gather affidavits from backyarders who allege that two leaders in the Our Pride Housing Project in Elsies River have been involved in corruption related to the project. This comes after a group calling themselves the Gugulethu Concerned Backyarders went public this week with allegations of corruption. The Gugulethu Concerned Backyarders, now numbering 48 after four of their members died, are the remnants of a 300-strong group called the Gugulethu RDP Housing Project, which formed in 2001. They appointed Phumla Dlokolo as their chairperson and approached the provincial Housing Department with their savings in 2006. Dlokolo had told them that R2 500 was required for a two-room house, and up to R5 000 for a larger house. Upon their submission to the department, then under MEC Richard Dyantyi, erven were obtained in Eerste River and an 821-unit housing project, named the Our Pride Housing Project, was given the go-ahead. The first phase was completed at the end of last year. However, the 48 remaining Gugulethu members have still not received houses and it has emerged that the housing department never required money from beneficiaries to be paid over. Dlokolo has stated she is repaying those involved, but backyarders say they have received no recompense from her. On Wednesday, Madikizela asked the Gugulethu Concerned Backyarders to provide him with sworn affidavits to enable him to investigate. The backyarders undertook to provide their statements by Monday and Madikizela said he would accompany the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) in conducting a door-to-door inspection to find out whether anyone had benefited from the project illegally. The backyarders allege that Dlokolo placed her family members, including seven of her children, on the beneficiary list and sold houses that were assigned to beneficiaries who have since died to friends and foreign nationals. ""I want to find out what happened to the houses of the people that are now deceased,"" said Madikizela. ""We need to get to the bottom of this and if we find that there are things that went wrong, we need to deal with that. There is a lot of corruption happening in our housing projects."" Gugulethu backyarder Malusi Msesi, who attended the meeting, said to Madikizela that Dlokolo deleted his name from the list because he ""did not have the R2 500 required"". ""I told her I won't pay because I qualify for a free house,"" Msesi said. Another backyarder, Mhlayivayo Qabaka, said he was expelled from the group by Dlokolo after she told him he had missed numerous meetings, which Qabaka denied. Qabaka said their preliminary investigations had revealed that people living in the houses at the Our Pride Housing Project came from Mfuleni, Khayelitsha, Delft, and were also African foreign nationals. ""I don't understand how this is happening under your nose,"" he told Madikizela."729,Cape Times (South Africa),9/12/2011,MEC to take action against corruption,E2 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (94%),NEWS; Pg. 3,CT,Newspaper, Mzoxolo Budaza,ENGLISH,205 words,,13-Sep-11,,CORRUPTION (90%); TALKS & MEETINGS (77%) News.SouthAfrica.WesternCape,"HUMAN Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela has promised Makhaza, Khayelitsha residents that he will go door-to-door with a list of legal home owners and take action against people occupying state-supplied houses illegally.

They said many houses were occupied by people who were not legal beneficiaries. Madikizela was also accused of not addressing people's needs effectively. Resident Lwazi Ngwane told Madikizela: ""You, together with (DA MP) Masizole Mnqasela, are dividing the community. You don't intervene when it matters most."" Madikizela admitted that as leaders they were not united and that it affected the delivery of services to the people. He urged anyone with evidence of corruption to come forward. He promised to go on site with a list of the houses' legal beneficiaries next week. ""Everyone who occupies a house, but is not on the list, will have to explain how that happened,"" he said.

The report said the SAPS was struggling with one of the major occupational hazards of policing: the abuse of power. ""While progress has been made since the outright brutalities of apartheid-era policing, corruption is one of the biggest challenges facing the SAPS."" In response the SAPS said: ""While the report points to common problems, it fails to acknowledge the achievements and significant milestones by the SAPS under the leadership of General Cele who has been at the forefront of fighting crime and rooting out corruption with the SAPS ranks."" Three days later, the SAPS issued another statement announcing the arrest of a Durban senior police officer for attempting to bribe the KwaZulu-Natal head of the special crime unit, the Hawks, with R2 million in return for documents relating to a case being investigated by the Hawks. The arrest of the senior police officer can be read in two ways: It proves the ISS right as much as it does the SAPS. It shows, as the ISS has argued, that police are corrupt, but it also shows, as the SAPS has said, that not all apples in the police barrel are rotten. After all, it was a fellow police officer who blew the whistle and had his colleague trapped and arrested. Where the ISS report trumps the police rebuttal is in its characterisation of the police profession as one which is ""particularly prone to the problem of corruption"". The ISS is backed here by an article by Martin Innes - director of the Universities' Police Science Institute at Cardiff University - who said that at the heart of policing were a set of defining tensions that have to be reconciled. ""The police are agents of the state, and yet need to be politically independent to command public respect. They are authorised to use coercive force to stop violent disorder,"" wrote Innes. ""They are in close contact with criminality, but need to preserve their integrity and resist corruption. They must uphold law and order without resorting to methods that undermine it."" Police corruption, Innes said, was not new. Nor was it a phenomenon of developing countries. It is to be found in the police departments of the developed countries too. Innes cited the Knapp Commission in the 1970s which found that the New York police department was systematically corrupt. At the other end of the world, Australians were at the same time investigating organised police corruption in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria. ""History is scarred by such cases. The extent of the problem was summed up by Robert Mark, who upon appointment as commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police in 1972, avidly noted that it failed the test of catching more criminals than it employed,"" wrote Innes. As South Africa's history before and after 1994 shows, the police force has its fair share of criminals on its pay. Some join the police; others are transformed by the experience. As Innes explains: ""Certain aspects of police work - combating drugs, vice and organised crime - seem especially open to corruption by virtue of exposure."" That being the case, the ISS is correct in that the best way to fight police corruption is to strengthen the integrity of the organisation as well as its employees."731,Cape Times (South Africa),10/14/2011,Lawsuit set to fight alleged Hajj industry corruption,E2 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (94%); SAUDI ARABIA (94%),NEWS; Pg. 1,CT,Newspaper, Aziz Hartley,ENGLISH,439 words,,16-Oct-11,,HAJJ (92%); CORRUPTION (91%); RELIGIOUS PILGRIMAGES (91%); CLASS ACTIONS (90%); SUITS & CLAIMS (90%); LITIGATION (90%); AGREEMENTS (90%); PASSPORTS & VISAS (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%); BUSINESS TORTS (78%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); PRICE FIXING (78%); SCANDALS (73%); CORPORATE WRONGDOING (73%); ACCREDITATION (71%); TOUR PACKAGES (71%); VOLUNTEERS (61%) News.SouthAfrica.WesternCape,"A CLASS action lawsuit is to be brought to tackle corruption in the Hajj industry and for the disbandment of the SA Hajj and Umrah Council (Sahuc). It is to be brought by Friends of the Hujjaj, a body formed at a meeting in Athlone on Tuesday, following allegations of corruption by some hajj operators, including inflated travel packages and attempts to sell fraudulently obtained visas for R3 000. Sahuc, the body working with the Saudi government on behalf of South African pilgrims to Mecca, is under fire for failing to intervene. ""We are pushing for a revolution in the hajj industry,"" said the National Consumer Forum's Imraahn Mukaddam, a member of Friends of the Hujjaj. This would be his second class action, the first the bread price-fixing scandal. ""We are in the process of (consulting) senior council,"" Mukaddam said. Annually, Sahuc and the Saudi government negotiate how many pilgrims may visit the kingdom. This year's quota was 3 000 - the lowest in years. Sahuc charges pilgrims R100 for accreditation to allow pilgrims to make travel arrangements with their operator. Sahuc then gives operators accreditation letters which they present when making bookings in Saudi Arabia. Mukaddam said Sahuc's status was questionable as no local NGO should be allowed to enter into binding agreements with a foreign government, as Sahuc had done. ""Sahuc is not entitled to make agreements on behalf of South African citizens,"" he said. Sahuc general secretary Shaheen Essop dismissed calls for it to disband. He also denied that Sahuc could not account for about R6 million it collected last year, and said audited reports were on the council's website. ""Problems started when some operators took passports to obtain visas in excess of their quota. Problems also arose when some agents - to get visas, claimed some South African hujjaj were permanent residents in neighbouring countries. All this resulted in a whole fiasco. Sahuc has no control over operators. Sahuc is a voluntary organisation. It employs four people countrywide,"" Essop said. He said Sahuc had launched its own probe. ""I'm not fazed. When there is corruption, fingers always get pointed at Sahuc. We enjoy the support of the Saudi Hajj Ministry and the South African Department of International Relations."" He said monies Sahuc collected were spent on services for the hujjaj, including health care and other assistance during pilgrimage. ""Friends of the Hujjaj can do whatever they want. We indicated we have launched our own investigation.They have not talked to us. There is the continual onslaught against Sahuc from its detractors,"" Essop said. aziz.hartley@inl.co.za"734,Cape Times (South Africa),10/28/2011,ANC accuses DA of ignoring corruption,E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (92%),NEWS; Pg. 7,CT,Newspaper, Quinton Mtyala Political Writer,ENGLISH,381 words,,29-Oct-11,"CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA (92%)",CORRUPTION (90%); CITY GOVERNMENT (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); MAYORS (78%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (78%); WITNESSES (76%); EXECUTIVES (73%); BANKING & FINANCE (71%) CapeTimes.News,"THE ANC has accused the DA and its leaders of hypocrisy, charging that they were aware of corruption and maladministration at the beleaguered Swellendam municipality but turned a blind eye. The accusation came as members of the Provincial Legislature yesterday debated the affairs of Swellendam following recent claims by the municipality's former chief financial officer Nigel Delo. Two weeks ago Delo said under oath that ID leader and current Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille had tried to pressure him into ""easing off"" his opposition to a deal whereby Swellendam's funds would be managed by a financial company with close links to the ID. The ANC's Ellen Prins charged that ""the people of Swellendam had enough of the political interference by people who think they can do as they please"". Swellendam was previously run by a coalition of the DA and the ID. Since May's election it has been ruled by the DA-ID and the ACDP. The DA's Johan Visser said the ANC, in calling for a debate on Swellendam, was trying to deflect attention from its own failings in government. The police's controversial lease deal which saw national commissioner Bheki Cele suspended was one such issue. But the ANC's Pierre Uys charged that Visser's comparison was irrelevant, and asked deputy Speaker Richard Majola to confine matters to Swellendam. But Visser would not relent, saying Prins, in calling for the debate, was misleading the House. Asked to withdraw the statement by Majola, Visser refused and was eventually ordered to leave the House. The ANC's Max Ozinsky said Premier Helen Zille had to hold Swellendam's officials to a similar standard to that demanded of other levels of government (controlled by the ANC). ""This is a botox premier, its all nice and shiny (at the beginning) but over time it falls down,"" said Ozinsky. He said evidence of interference was contained in leaked e-mails between ACDP provincial leader Grant Haskin and its sole councillor in Swellendam, Julian Matthysen. In the e-mail, Matthysen is being reigned in and threatened that if he ever delivered any ""surprises"" he would be removed by the ACDP. Haskin's e-mail in August came after Matthysen had defied party orders and voted with the ANC on the sale of municipal land which was opposed by the DA. quinton.mtyala@inl.co.za"735,Cape Times (South Africa),11/28/2011,Corruption lawyer sees police bribery first-hand after landing at OR Tambo,E2 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (92%),NEWS; Pg. 1,CT,Newspaper, Shaun Smillie,ENGLISH,210 words,,29-Nov-11,,BRIBERY (90%); LAWYERS (90%); POLICE FORCES (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); HUMAN RIGHTS (78%); ROADSIDE SERVICES (75%); COMPANY STRUCTURES & OWNERSHIP (71%); ROAD TRANSPORTATION SUPPORT SERVICES (68%); MOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES (57%) News,"JOHANNESBURG: Fatima Hassan is a human rights lawyer whose work is to often fight the injustices caused by corrupt police officials.

Denvor Fielies, the former head of streets, stormwater, parks and resorts at the Riversdale-based municipality, received a R350 000 kickback to secure tenders to the tune of almost R650 000 for a man named Paul Fischer over a two-year period. Fielies pleaded guilty to 39 counts of corruption in the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Bellville. On October 25, 2010, he was sentenced to a R60 000 fine and one year's imprisonment suspended for five years. Had he failed to pay the fine, he would have to serve two years. But the DPP in the Western Cape took the matter to the Western Cape High Court in a bid for leave to appeal the sentence, which it considered to be inappropriately lenient. Judge Andre le Grange has now granted the DPP leave to appeal Fielies's sentence. In Le Grange's judgment, he said the magistrate had considered that Fielies was a first offender who had pleaded guilty to the charges. He had also admitted that he had helped Fischer draw up quotations to ensure that Fischer's company was the successful tender bidder, and that he had asked Fischer to submit quotations on behalf of other service providers without their knowledge. Weight was also placed on Fielies's personal circumstances. He was married with two children, aged 20 and 11, and had a number of expenses, such as R4 650 a month for rent, his son's college fees of some R6 700 a month and almost R3 000 a month for his daughter's school fees. ""I am of the view that the imposed sentence by the magistrate is not consistent with reported judgments of our higher courts in similar matters,"" Le Grange said in his judgment.

This came after the scrapping of a multimillion-rand tender to police SA's fishing stocks. The tender had been awarded to an empowerment company with close links to the ANC and the government: Sekunjalo, headed by Iqbal Surve. After the tender was awarded, it emerged that Surve had paid for additional security at the home of International Relations and Co-operation Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane. Sekunjalo was awarded an R800 million tender to police SA's marine resources and to manage and operate four marine patrol and research vessels. But the tender was withdrawn in the face of litigation against the department by the current tender-holder, Smit Amandla Marine, whose contract expires at the end of this month. The company pointed out that there was a conflict of interest due to Sekunjalo's ownership of Premier Fishing, a major player in the fishing industry. Joemat-Pettersson has since alleged that the awarding of the existing and previous contracts to Smit Amandla Marine may also be suspect. Yesterday Fisheries spokesman Lionel Adendorf said a new entity to replace Smit Amandla would be operational by April 1. Joemat-Pettersson said the process in awarding the tender to ""an innocent company"", Sekunjalo had been flawed. ""The reality is that, based on legal advice, it was our processes and procedures that failed."" She said she had decided to scrutinise ""broadly"" all current and past tenders awarded by the fisheries branch of her department. The probe would focus on whether government employees or those from the private sector were responsible for fraud, corruption or maladministration in the awarding of tenders. She hoped it would be in place at the start of April. quinton.mtyala@inl.co.za"742,Cape Times (South Africa),3/22/2012,This corruption is so frustrating and so unfair,E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (92%),MOTORING; Pg. 8,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,119 words,,22-Mar-12,,BRIBERY (87%); CORRUPTION (87%); DRIVING & TRAFFIC LAWS (72%) Motoring,"THIS is so frustrating as its gets worse and seems like nothing is being done.

""The debate is long overdue,"" you told the audience. ""It shouldn't wait for next week or next month; it should have started already."" Your statement is welcome. Regrettably the debate over party funding has languished for years because vested interests in all political parties have continually shut it down. Nevertheless, we accept your invitation to begin the debate today so that we can overcome the critics' claim that South African political parties are for sale. We refuse to believe that our liberation movement - which overcame apartheid and led the establishment of multiparty democracy for all people - has become beholden to private interests. We have all sacrificed too much on behalf of the struggle and democracy to let even the appearance of corruption remain. No comrade can deny the unfortunate fact that so long as the funding of all political parties - not just the ANC and DA - takes place behind closed doors, public faith in the integrity of parties is undermined. When the people see some of their leaders driving fancy cars or flying in private jets while poverty continues around them, and then read in the press that certain companies connected to public officials are receiving state tenders, they will doubt not just the integrity of the officials concerned but that of government and the ANC. Parties depend on funding to fulfil their obligations under the constitution, but secret donations by private companies and foreign states threaten public confidence in democracy itself. Regrettably, more people say they distrust the president, Parliament, opposition parties, and their local government rather than trust these vital institutions, according to the latest AfroBarometer survey. Less than half of the people say they are satisfied with democracy and are willing to try something different if it fails to bring improvements to their daily lives soon. And fully 83% say that corruption of money and politics has become a way of life in SA, according to a 2012 TNS survey. All democratically elected governments must continually earn and keep the public trust: just as justice must be seen to be done in the courts, so must democratic accountability be seen and felt in the public square. ANC supporters and the broader public are ready to work with you and all interested parties to bring private funding of South African politics into the light of day so that people can have their faith in government restored. As you said in your remarks and as we have long agreed, the debate over party funding must centre on ensuring that there is ""transparent declaration of the interests of all political parties and the funding thereof"" and ensuring that parties have sufficient state funding and other resources to meet their responsibilities within a multi-party democracy. All parties have agreed in the past that transparency and increased public funding are important, although all have yet to act. Accompanied by comprehensive regulation of private party funding, such reforms can offer a real solution to the public's growing concern over corruption and conflicts of interest in our government. Time and again, our party has taken the principled position on party funding reform, even as the pace of change has been slow. In 2007, the ANC committed at Polokwane to ""champion public funding of represented political parties (and) effective regulation of private funding... to enhance accountability and transparency to the citizenry."" You yourself wrote in 2009 that, ""the biggest threat to our movement is the intersection between the business interests and holding of public office."" And our President Jacob Zuma has boldly stated that, ""When money changes hands in the battle for personal power and aggrandisement, where is the movement built around membership that joins without motives of material advantage and personal gain?"" Thank you for reminding us of the urgent need to resolve this difficult challenge and ensure transparency and accountability in the funding of all political parties. With your leadership, we can finally give South African the debate they deserve on party funding reform. The time for Parliament to act against the threat of corruption in party funding is now. l Achmat and Dwane are political activists and ANC supporters and write in their personal capacities."744,Cape Times (South Africa),3/28/2012,Corruption is an evil society must root out,E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (92%),Pg. 11,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,724 words,,29-Mar-12,,RELIGION (90%); CORRUPTION (87%); ROBBERY (74%); PIPELINE TRANSPORTATION (68%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (67%); BRIBERY (65%); WATER CRISES & SHORTAGES (63%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (59%) CapeTimes.Opinion,"There we were, at a funeral at a village near Polokwane a few days ago, multitudes of us. The deceased had succumbed to cancer of the throat and all those who were close to him, especially his family, were expressing more relief than sorrow at his passing. They saw him in excruciating pain, unable to eat, going in and out of hospital and being reduced to mere skin and bones. ""He has escaped pain; he has rested; it is better this way,"" they said variously. The family belong to one of the charismatic churches and a brother of the deceased is a pastor in the same church. Ministers of religion were there in full force and shared the priestly duties seamlessly. The sermons, both at home and at the graveyard, were as vigorous and inspired as they were eloquent, with the mourners participating by occasionally raising their hands to the heavens and shouting their appreciation of the utterances of the preachers. As we trudged our way back home from the graveyard, I expected nothing other than the customary refreshments, handshakes and the small talk that are usually part of funerals. A few of us were shepherded into a large room and as we commented about the viciousness of cancer, the chatting, rather imperceptively, shifted to the cancer of corruption in our country. The passion and insight with which people spoke on the topic took me by surprise. Two men took the lead in the discussion, speaking in tandem, but others chipping in approvingly. Corruption is a cancer that is ravaging the country and according to them, it is unstoppable and incurable. It is just about to overwhelm our society. Apparently, the village suffers from a chronic shortage of water. Several years ago, water pipes were laid to solve the problem. But no water has ever flowed through those pipes. Recently, another contractor arrived in the village and started digging to lay new pipes. When the villagers protested, saying pipes are already in the ground, they were told the new pipes would give them water. After the completion of this project, there is still not a single drop of water coming through. This was just another case of the crooked giving one another tenders to make money. They talked about a contractor who was given a contract worth tens of millions of rand to tar a road in their area, despite the person having no capacity to do such a job. The road crumbled within a year. Their examples were local and apparently well known. They referred to school feeding scheme tenderpreneurs who short-change the tiny tots of food; classrooms, school books and desks that are not provided because money has been stolen; a granny removed from the database and then asked to pay a bribe to some official for her name to go back into the system; and a well-known thug whose armed robbery case collapsed because the docket disappeared. Who would lead the fight if the previous and present commissioners of police are linked to corruption - the former doing time in prison and the latter facing a public inquiry? Another senior cop, Richard Mdluli, is on suspension due to allegations of murder and other shenanigans. What kind of country would we be if citizens do not trust politicians, the police or the judges - and educational certificates cannot be accepted at face value? Scary, is it not? Suddenly, all eyes were on me when one of the ""preachers"" asked me directly: ""Having been a politician, an MP and a minister, how do you suggest we handle this dire situation?"" Fortunately, before I could open my mouth, another man rescued me. ""That's where you make a mistake. This is not something that should be left to politicians, police or judges. It is a societal thing. It is society as whole that bears the brunt of this scourge. It therefore requires the involvement of society as a whole,"" he said as heads nodded all round. Others bolstered this line of reasoning by suggesting that we mobilise our churches, mosques, temples, political parties, trade unions and any other form of societal organisation to fight this scourge before it devours us. More importantly, it was said, individual citizens should be encouraged to report incidence of corruption to the police, the public protector, Corruption Watch, the media or any other structure or person who might be able to do something about it. I left the village on a high, encouraged by what I had heard."745,Cape Times (South Africa),3/30/2012,"Health care riddled with corruption, says watchdog body",E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (92%),NEWS; Pg. 7,CT,Newspaper, Melanie Gosling,ENGLISH,517 words,,31-Mar-12,"CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA (91%)",HEALTH CARE (91%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); CORRUPTION (89%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (89%); INTERNET & WWW (86%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); ANTITRUST & TRADE LAW (77%); PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS (71%); WEB SITES (69%); RURAL COMMUNITIES (67%); SUBURBS (62%); MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS (54%) CapeTimes,"THE newly founded Corruption Watch will soon release a report on the ""corruption free-for-all"" in SA's health care system, particularly about corruption in the allocation of tenders. Corruption Watch head David Lewis, who chaired the Competition Tribunal from 1999 to 2009, told the Cape Town Press Club this week that probably the greatest number of complaints their organisation had received since it began eight weeks ago dealt with corruption in the health care system. ""We've heard about doctors getting paid by the public sector and working in private companies . . . But it is no surprise that tender procurements in health care are particularly leaky. ""It is undoubted that global companies are very skilled in dealing with local officials. ""The fact that (health care) is run by the provinces has made some contribution to this,"" Lewis said. The report, which will be released in a couple of months, will go first to the authorities before being made public. ""Our approach is not to begin from an adversarial standpoint, but to say to the state: 'Here it is, tell us if you think we are wrong.' ""I think from certain institutions of state we will get a very sympathetic response, because they have encouraged us to do this. But from others, not."" The first report Corruption Watch will release will be into the corruption in the Johannesburg Metro Police, an ""acknowledged site of virulent corruption"". Lewis said the responses they had received from the public had shown that concern about corruption in SA was widespread and came from people in all walks of life. People could report corruption on the organisation's website or via an SMS. About 85 percent of the internet complaints on the website were from African middle class people, and 100 percent of the SMS complaints were from black people, particularly from rural areas and marginalised communities. ""The problem of corruption has been presented for so long as a suburban issue, and an anti-government sentiment. ""It is gratifying that this is not the case at all. Corruption in rural towns or informal settlements is a very visible phenomenon to people living there."" In the first eight weeks of its existence, Corruption Watch had received 1 200 complaints. ""They were not all about corruption, but there were also allegations of very serious tender fraud. In the middle there were complaints about corruption in traffic departments and licensing departments. What we're trying to do is to discern hot spots of corruption and disseminate this. ""We will have to gather a lot more data before patterns become apparent. ""We're also doing investigations into systemic corruption."" One of the fears was that using the internet would attract ""nutters"", as talk radio did. However, Lewis said this had not been the case. Corruption Watch was not interested only in the corruption that involved ""money changing hands in a suitcase"", but what Lewis described as ""influence-peddling corruption"". ""This in many ways is where the real destruction of the system of governance is, not necessarily a prosecutable case, but conduct unbecoming that is really corrosive."""746,Cape Times (South Africa),4/4/2012,It's time to deal with scourge of corruption: Public Protector,E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (92%),NEWS; Pg. 5,CT,Newspaper, Michelle Jones,ENGLISH,508 words,,6-Apr-12,,CORRUPTION (89%) CapeTimes.News,"CORRUPTION is at a tipping point and SA needs to deal with the scourge decisively, says Public Protector Thuli Madonsela. ""If it is correct that we all want an accountable state that operates with the highest level of integrity while being responsive to the needs of its citizens and residents, then we should all play our part to contribute,"" she said, addressing the 13th International Winelands Conference in Stellenbosch yesterday. ""When we get out of the conference, the trajectory of our country depends on what each of us does. We have the power to determine the next phase."" The theme of this year's conference was Integrity and Governance: What is wrong? What is good? What is next? About 100 people gathered at the Stellenbosch Institute for Advanced Studies yesterday to hear Madonsela speak. Throughout her 45 minute speech, she referred to a statement made by Nelson Mandela. While addressing the opening of Parliament in 1999, Mandela said that when someone in power used public funds for his or her own benefit, ""then we must admit that we are a sick society"". ""Our hope for the future deeply depends also on our resolution as a nation in dealing with the scourge of corruption. ""Success will require an acceptance that, in many respects, we are a sick society,"" Mandela had said. Madonsela said SA was in need of ""selfless, committed and unwavering"" leadership. ""That is what President Mandela was calling for,"" she said. ""Corruption is endemic in our country, both in the public and private sectors. ""If we don't deal with corruption decisively, it will not only impact on good governance but has the potential to distort our economy and to derail democracy. ""We are at a tipping point and President Mandela's warning remains valid."" She said it was appropriate that Mandela had likened corruption to a sickness. ""Indeed, others have called it a cancer. If we candidly view corruption as a cancer, we empower ourselves to deal with it as a nation the way we would deal with it if it were a cancer afflicting our body. ""We would isolate it and do all we can to get rid of it, with a view to saving ourselves from death or disability."" Madonsela said the public protector was an important, but not central, player in the fight against corruption. She said her office sought to address specific allegations of maladministration and also to act as a catalyst for systemic transformation in pursuit of good governance. Madonsela said she had recently been asked what it would take to end corruption. After some pondering, she had come up with three essential factors: l Strengthening public accountability by empowering civil society to ask questions and promoting good leadership. l Transparency, without which accountability would be impossible. l Strengthening communication among enforcement or accountability agencies. She also added that impunity must come to end. ""Otherwise all anti-corruption and anti-maladministration efforts are useless. There shouldn't be protected people or holy cows.""

It was quite the fall for someone whose hope, reportedly, was ""to conquer the world"". Murdoch's protracted tumble from the top has exposed the incestuous relationships between the media and the political and financial elite of England, and the corruption that imperils the very institution of British journalism. But, in the US, where accountability journalism is also under siege, we would be wise to see the crisis across the pond as a cautionary tale. The decimation of American newspapers is well documented; last year alone, over 3 700 newspaper jobs were eliminated. To stem profit losses, media conglomerates that once greedily bought up every paper in sight are now dumping them at an alarming rate. Take the Tribune Company, which slashed staff and destroyed much of the value of the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times and others, but doled out $100 million for performance bonuses for its executives. Never mind that those executives drove the company into bankruptcy. Citizens of this digital era have access to more platforms and channels than before. But the quality journalism that checks our leaders, that holds accountable the powerful and influential, is in jeopardy. Under the crushing pressure of commercialism, where speed is prized over thought, reporting deteriorates into a feeding frenzy of the 24-hour news cycle. The void of accountability journalism has too often been filled by liars and charlatans peddling fairy tales: ""President Barack Obama is a Kenyan-born Muslim""; ""global warming is a worldwide conspiracy of greedy climate scientists""; ""the financial crisis was the result of government regulation"". The result is what John Nichols and Robert W McChesney call ""the most serious threat to self-government and the rule of law"". It's not simply that newsrooms lack resources, or that aggregating sites that prioritise dancing kittens get so many hits. It's also that in a high-minded effort to impartially represent all sides of a story, reporters often give more credence to an argument than the facts warrant. But, as political scientists Norman Ornstein and Thomas E Mann recently wrote in The Washington Post, ""a balanced treatment of an unbalanced phenomenon distorts reality"". The role of journalists is not to give every party equal space, or accede to the red herring of false equivalence, but to pursue and publish the truth. I am the editor of a magazine of opinion and news. We value intelligent arguments and we value accurate reporting because, as the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan was fond of saying, we are entitled to our own opinions, but not to our own facts. At the national level, several newspapers and magazines like ours continue to provide quality coverage where others have fallen short. But the same can't be said of the empty pressrooms in capitals and city halls across the country - and the implications are dangerous. ""People do awful things to each other,"" veteran war photographer George Guthrie says in Tom Stoppard's play Night and Day, ""but it's worse in places where everyone is kept in the dark."" There are rays of hope. It was, after all, superior investigative journalism by a newspaper that exposed the Murdoch empire's web of corruption. As Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger has recounted, when veteran reporter Nick Davies received a tip about phone hacking, he doggedly chased it, despite the risks - financial and other - of pursuing an almost omnipotent corporation. We can still see the embers of this kind of accountability journalism in the US. Last week, I had the privilege of presenting the 2012 Hillman Award for Newspaper Journalism - which honours journalism promoting the common good - to the Atlanta-Journal Constitution for its groundbreaking investigation that uncovered cheating on standardised tests in the Atlanta Public Schools. Corporate interests threatened to pull business if the cash-strapped paper ran the resulting articles. Yet the paper stuck with the story. This type of reporting is increasingly rare. Yet there is enormous potential to build up a new journalism in the public interest, and non-profit models like ProPublica are laying the foundation. But there is much more to do. A 2009 Columbia Journalism School report, The Reconstruction of American Journalism, co-authored by former Washington Post executive editor Leonard Downie jr, explores how the federal government can help sustain public and community media. If we are to successfully combat the corporatisation and gutting of media, we must develop new public funding sources for accountability journalism and train the next generation of reporters to honestly and boldly seek the truth. This is not a radical proposition; other countries, including those at the top of The Economist's index of free and democratic states, publicly fund independent journalism. But necessary change will not come until an engaged society demands it. - The Washington Post l Editor/publisher of The Nation magazine, Vanden Heuvel writes a column for The Washington Post."750,Cape Times (South Africa),6/11/2012,Government leases to reveal corruption,E2 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (92%),NEWS; Pg. 1,CT,Newspaper, Mogomotsi Magome,ENGLISH,384 words,,12-Jun-12,"PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA (91%)",RENTAL PROPERTY (91%); CORRUPTION (91%); LEASE AGREEMENTS (90%); LEASING INDUSTRY (90%); PROPERTY LEASES (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); INTERVIEWS (90%); BUDGETS (78%); APPOINTMENTS (78%); BANKING & FINANCE (77%); INVESTIGATIONS (77%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (75%); POLICE FORCES (75%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (70%) CapeTimes.News,"A REVIEW of government property leases worth around R3 billion a year is expected to uncover widespread corruption, says acting director-general of Public Works, Mandisa Fatyela-Lindie.

Among leases signed by the department were controversial leases for SAPS headquarters buildings in Pretoria and Durban. In an investigation into disgraced police chief Bheki Cele's involvement in the SAPS leasing saga, Judge Jakes Moloi found Cele to have a ""questionable relationship"" with Roux Shabangu, the property baron who owned, among other buildings, Pretoria's Middestad building earmarked as a regional headquarters for the police. The department will soon face off with Shabangu in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria in an attempt to have the R500-million SAPS Middestad lease declared null and void. Fatyela-Lindie was appointed acting director-general this year and is expected to spearhead the department's turn around strategy announced by minister Thulas Nxesi in his budget vote speech last month. ""We know there is a lot of anxiety in the property industry about the public pronouncements by the minister on the review of the leases.

""We have seen the number of mob justice attacks in the area and that shows us there is a problem here. The number of complaints that we have received from the area is also very high. We will investigate all the cases,"" he said. A deadline for the investigation has not been set. The SJC yesterday welcomed the probe. ""We think that it is an important intervention and hope something will come of it,"" co-ordinator Gavin Silber said. ""However we still feel that a commission of inquiry will be an important step in solving this problem. (IPID) fixing their department would be blocking a small problem in the system. ""The reason we called for a commission is because we feel that the system is broken. It is not just about the police, it is about the courts failing the people. We hope that their intervention will bring some changes to some of the complaints we have submitted."" Silber said they had met the directorate yesterday to discuss the complaints they had submitted to Zille, including: l Police misconduct l Lawless behaviour l Abuse of power l People saw police as aggressors instead of protectors.

In fact, from President Jacob Zuma and ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe down to the ordinary ANC faithful, we are told that eradicating corruption is a primary ANC goal. No it is not. The evidence before me suggests loyalty to comrades and support for one or other faction is far more important to the top brass in the ANC than acting against corruption. Stealing public money really hurts the poor first. If we had no corruption, we would have had more than enough money to upgrade our schools and hospitals, train and appoint more doctors, teachers and nurses, and supply more people with potable water, proper sewerage and electricity. The stark reality is that through tolerating, sometimes even encouraging, corruption and tenderpreneurship, the ANC is showing a thick middle finger to the very same people they claim to have liberated. So what is the evidence I'm talking about? I could point to the R50 billion arms deal where hundreds of millions landed in the pockets of politicians and ANC-connected middlemen. I could remind you that there was strong prima facie evidence of corruption, fraud and racketeering against Zuma himself, but in a highly suspicious move the charges were dropped. I could point out that the ANC chairman in Limpopo and close buddy of expelled ANC Youth League leader Julius Malema, Cassel Mathale, has been associated with many allegations of tender fraud in the province he is also premier of, but was re-elected nevertheless and is still a member of the ANC's national executive. I could add that the chairman of the ANC in the Northern Cape is suspected of corruption, fraud and money laundering, but he was recently re-elected. Several newspapers have reported that ANC stalwart Mac Maharaj had irregularly awarded huge tenders to companies belonging to convicted fraudster Schabir Shaik and was allegedly rewarded with money in his wife's account and an expensive US holiday. He was still appointed the official spokesman of the president. I can add many other similar stories of corrupt or allegedly corrupt ANC officials who were never prosecuted and remained in their positions in the party. But I would prefer to move away from allegations and newspaper reports and tell you about evidence accepted by a court of law that shows clearly how casually the ANC leadership treats corruption. In 2008, two ANC councillors of the Rustenburg municipality, Alfred Motsi and Moss Phakoe, became aware of serious corruption involving the ANC mayor, Matthews Wolmarans. Wolmarans is a close associate of the chairman of the ANC in North West, Supra Mataboge. The two councillors compiled a detailed dossier on the corrupt dealings. They raised it in the council, but there was no reaction. They took their dossier to the police. Nothing happened. The two men travelled to Johannesburg to see Mantashe and left copies of the dossier for him. Mantashe dismissed the two as troublemakers. In December 2008, Motsi and Phakoe went to Nkandla to see Zuma. They explained their dossier and pleaded for action. A month or two later they took their evidence to a meeting in Potchefstroom with Zuma, deputy president Kgalema Motlanthe, ANC treasurer Mathews Phosa and North West premier Thandi Modise. They handed their dossier to the minister then in charge of local government, Sicelo Shiceka, during a meeting in Rustenburg which mayor Wolmarans also attended. Phakoe afterwards told Motsi: ""This might be my last day."" Two days later the mayor's bodyguard, Enoch Matshaba, shot Phakoe in his parked car at his Rustenburg home. Phakoe died on the spot. Motsi's crusade led to his suspension as chairperson of the MK Veterans Association - he abused his position, it was found. Wolmarans was the obvious suspect, but the officer in charge of the investigation accused Motsi of the murder. Only last year, when the Hawks raided crime intelligence boss Richard Mdluli's office did they find the dossier and charged Wolmarans and his bodyguard. Two weeks ago, Judge Ronnie Hendricks found that Motsi was a truthful witness. He sentenced Wolmarans to 20 years and Matshaba to life in prison. Shame on you, Jacob Zuma. Shame on you, Gwede Mantashe."753,Cape Times (South Africa),8/2/2012,We can all still learn from the Indian masters of corruption,E1 Edition,INDIA (93%); SOUTH AFRICA (93%),Pg. 10,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,513 words,,3-Aug-12,"KOLKATA, WEST BENGAL, INDIA (58%); DELHI, INDIA (58%)",BRIC COUNTRIES (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); BRIBERY (78%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (76%); PUBLIC POLICY (73%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (72%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (71%); SOCIAL JUSTICE (67%); CIVIL SERVICES (66%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (59%) CapeTimes.Opinion,"YES, we all know that South Africa is riddled with corruption, but it could be worse. As in our Bric partner India, for instance. I have just been re-reading James Cameron's wonderful memoir An Indian Summer. In 1972 he returned to the sub-continent, having spent 25 years revisiting the country countless times as a foreign correspondent and conducting with it, as so many of us who know it have, a love-hate relationship. This time, however, it was as the newly-married husband of an Indian woman, which helped to give him more of a personal pride in India's achievements, and disappointment in its shortcomings. No shortcoming was more obvious, 25 years after independence, than the scale of its corruption. The totality and pervasiveness of Indian corruption was ""almost a matter of national pride, sanctified by the oldest of traditions and denied by nobody"". The process was acknowledged and ratified: ""It is ordained that every official can be bribed, every commodity can be adulterated, every scarcity can be exploited, every contract can be fiddled, every privilege can be bought, every examination can be wangled, every bureaucrat must be paid not just to expedite the application-form but specifically not to obstruct it."" Maybe we are not quite as bad as that, yet. But there are other similarities. The Indian government then had 510 ministers - 55 in Delhi itself, and the others in the various state legislatures. There are probably more now. They each earned 800 times more than the average Indian income and lived in opulent homes. Cameron writes: ""One would mind less about their lifestyle did they not protest that they represented the destitute and needy."" At its existing rate the government's constitutional policy of equality and social justice ""would take about 40 million years to achieve"". Nearly 40 years after the book was written I found myself chatting to a couple of civil servants on an overnight train to Kolkata. They wanted to know about corruption in South Africa's then 14-year-old democratic administration. I said yes, we also suffered from it, but give us time. Time wouldn't improve matters, they insisted. ""We've been independent for 60 years, enough time for corruption to be perfected."" And if we think our education system is a disaster after 18 years, 25 years after independence 70 percent of Indians were still illiterate and ""the college system was in such a calamitous mess that there were even illiterate graduates"". So no need to worry too much, especially about corruption and the 20% of all government procurements totalling billions of rand reported missing each year, either stolen or unaccountable through negligence. Or the Arms Deal which made politicians and their cronies hundreds of millions richer. Or the fact that Public Protector Thuli Madonsela says endemic corruption is at tipping point. Or that Archbishop Desmond Tutu believes President Zuma and his government no longer represent him - ""you represent your own interests"". We still have some way to go before we reach India's state of corrupt perfection. johnvscott@mweb.co.za"754,Cape Times (South Africa),8/20/2012,Former MEC appeals corruption ruling,E1 Edition,THAILAND (55%),NEWS; Pg. 5,CT,Newspaper, Leila Samodien Justice Writer,ENGLISH,473 words,,21-Aug-12,,SENTENCING (92%); JAIL SENTENCING (91%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (90%); LITIGATION (90%); BRIBERY (90%); CORRECTIONS (78%); ORGANIZED CRIME (78%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (78%); EXTRADITION (77%); POLITICS (75%); FUNDRAISING (74%); ACQUITTAL (71%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (71%) CapeTimes.News,"IN 2006, former Western Cape environment and planning MEC David Malatsi was sentenced to five years behind bars for corruption after pocketing a R50 000 bribe. But up to now, he maintains: ""I did nothing wrong. I was not influenced by the money."" Malatsi appealed his conviction and sentence in the Western Cape High Court on Friday. On December 11, 2006, he was sentenced to five years behind bars in the Bellville Regional Court; however, Malatsi's jail time has been put on hold pending his appeal. His then-co-accused, former Western Cape premier Peter Marais, was acquitted. It was found that Malatsi had received R100 000 from Italian businessman Riccardo Agusta in April, 2002 for the R550-million golf estate at Roodefontein, outside Plettenberg Bay. Agusta, the owner and developer of the golf estate, gave him a cheque for R100 000 as a ""donation"" to the New National Party (NNP), of which Malatsi was a member. Half of the money - R50 000 - was deposited into Malatsi's personal bank account. It also emerged that alleged Mafia kingpin Vito Palazzolo was key in the decision-making surrounding the Roodefontein development. Palazzolo is presently in jail in Thailand, awaiting a decision over whether he will be extradited to Italy to serve a nine-year sentence. On Friday, Malatsi's advocate, Andre Botha, said his appeal boiled down to whether or not the regional court was correct in rejecting Malatsi's explanation that he had not been influenced by the money. He said his client held a fund-raising position within the NNP. Malatsi's receiving the cheque, he said, had therefore not been unlawful, as he was expected to raise funds for the party. The question was whether Malatsi had allowed the money to influence his decision on the Roodefontein project, which had gone in favour of the developer. Botha acknowledged that when Malatsi was given the cheque, he knew it was in respect of Roodefontein. Judge Patrick Gamble asked whether he had known it was a bribe but accepted it anyway, saying that though he took the money, he had still done his job properly. Judge Gamble also questioned Botha on whether the correct thing for his client to have done was to tear up the cheque. Botha confirmed that his client knew it was intended as a bribe. ""(Malatsi) says in hindsight, he should have torn it up but he banked it. He did not try to hide the money; it's there in his bank account, but he did not disclose it."" Malatsi had not disclosed the R50 000 in his account to his party superiors because in the political climate at the time, it would have created a ""huge, huge problem"" for him. However, the State's advocate, Louis van Niekerk, said every decision Malatsi had made concerning Roodefontein had been guided by his desire to satisfy his ""paymaster"".

The forum is supported by Kairos Southern Africa and the SA Council of Churches. Religious leaders in the city, headed by Anglican Archbishop Thabo Makgoba, issued a stern warning to political leaders about their reluctance to deal with corruption. This and the public's silence would lead to society crumbling, they said. The launch of the campaign follows the religious leaders' Anti-Corruption Summit in June where they heard testimonies from communities, social justice activists and the office of the public protector on the cost of corruption and pledged to join the fight against it. They said the corrupt pursuit of money and power was threatening SA's young democracy and robbing the poor of their basic needs and opportunities. Speaking at Look Out Hill in Khayelitsha yesterday, Makgoba said corruption had a serious effect on how society, the government and the public sector operated. He said that if good men and women remained quiet, the country would have failed to fight corruption. Religious leaders should take it upon themselves to fight corruption, he said. ""We as religious leaders are still learning to speak truth to power but are afraid to speak truth to our friends who are in power,"" Makgoba said, adding that corruption in whatever form was not right. He said their call against corruption was not limited only to those in power but was also addressed to members of the public. Those ordinary citizens offering or taking bribes, regardless of how small they were, were fuelling the problem, Makgoba said. Pastor Xola Skosana of the Way of Life Church in Khayelitsha said the discourse on corruption should not be limited to maladministration or procurement. It should also speak to the inequalities in our society. He issued a challenge to mayor Patricia De Lille, Western Cape Premier Helen Zille and President Jacob Zuma to focus on the gap between those in affluent areas and those in the townships. ""They manage and preside over a corrupt and fraudulent political system. ""That in itself opens up a breeding ground for all types of corruption,"" Skosana said. Catholic Archbishop Stephen Brislin said that in recent times, corruption had broken the trust between members of the public and their leaders. He said the situation in Marikana, where more than 30 people were killed in clashes between miners and police, was only a symptom of what was happening in the country Brislin said there was a lot of anger over corruption. Chief Rabbi Warren Goldstein said the moral regeneration of society required that children should learn the bill of responsibility at school. Doing so would instil a |culture of responsibility. ""If the schools are not teaching it, take it up with the principal. If the principal is not responsive, then take it up with the MEC of Education,"" Goldstein said. He encouraged people to use platforms such as Corruption Watch. A declaration for the call to end corruption was signed by 18 religious leaders in Cape Town and 44 other signatories. The campaign plans to hold dialogues on corruption across the country. It will conclude in a national ""preach and teach"" event on International Anti-Corruption Day on December 9. xolani.koyana@inl.co.za IN ONE of the strongest stances yet taken against corruption people of all faiths came together in Khayelitsha yesterday to launch an anti-corruption campaign led by the Western Cape Religious Leaders Forum."757,Cape Times (South Africa),8/24/2012,It is every engaged citizen's business to fight corruption,E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (92%),Pg. 10,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,696 words,ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION & DEVELOPMENT (56%),25-Aug-12,,CORRUPTION (93%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); LETTERS & COMMENTS (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); CONSTITUTIONAL LAW (71%); RELIGION (71%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (71%); POLICE FORCES (68%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (67%); ASSET FORFEITURE (66%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (58%) CapeTimes.Opinion,"Your editorial and two of the pieces on the facing leader page of August 23, ""Stop theft from our people"" and ""We've done it beforeí¢[#x20ac]_"" focus on the topic of corruption, its endemic nature and the real and immediate threat it poses to our nascent democratic order. There is a culture of impunity flourishing in our society that complements what religious leaders call ""a growing sense of entitlement among rich and poor alike"". Countering the spread of the cancer of corruption ought to be a national priority that is taken far more seriously than is at present the case. It is internationally recognised that the best means of acting against corruption is through the establishment of an independent anti-corruption entity (ACE). The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development research identifies specialisation, training, guaranteed resources and security of tenure of office for personnel as the applicable criteria for a successful ACE. The Scorpions had some of these characteristics but were disbanded following a resolution taken by the ANC at Polokwane in 2007. Their replacement, the Hawks, or Directorate of Priority Crime Investigation, have been found wanting by the Constitutional Court. The Hawks are insufficiently independent to be an effective ACE. They do not specialise in corruption, their training is inadequate and, as a unit in SAPS, their resourcing leaves much to be desired. The Hawks are headed by a deployed cadre of the ANC and do not enjoy security of tenure any more than the Scorpions did. In these circumstances it is small wonder they do a mere fraction of the work done by the Scorpions. According to Martin Plaut's analysis of the relevant official statistics: ""The number of new investigations fell by 85% while the value of contraband seized fell by a staggering 99.1%"". [Who Rules SA page 299]. Now Parliament, as ordered by the court, is deliberating upon remedial legislation and the future of the Hawks. Instead of making a clean break with what is clearly not working, the deck-chairs in the SAPS and the Hawks are being rearranged in a manner that offends the constitutional precept that the chief of police controls the SAPS. Civil society attempts to persuade Parliament that there are better ways of combating corruption fell on deaf ears and a new challenge to the constitutionality of the purportedly remedial legislation looms. It does not have to be like this. An active citizenry, led by religious leaders who do more than talk among themselves and their followers, could put pressure on the authorities to pay due heed to the warnings given by those who are not coping with the tidal wave of corruption. Advocate Willie Hofmeyr of the Asset Forfeiture Unit has announced that he doubts that the target of a mere 100 corruption convictions involving more than R5 million within five years is attainable. The public protector warns of a corruption ""tipping point"" and calls for enhanced public accountability, greater transparency via the work of free media and a countering of the culture of impunity. The establishment of a proper ACE is within the means and the power of the state; all that is missing is the necessary political will. The time has come for Parliament, as representatives of the people, not deployees of the political parties, to reject the executive's plans for the Hawks and to insist upon the establishment of a new Chapter Nine institution to tackle corruption. This might head off future Marikana massacres and more crooked arms deals. The task can not be left to courageous individuals like the Glenisters, Crawford-Brownes and Youngs of SA. It is every engaged citizen's business to speak up and act against corruption. The passage of the SAPS Amendment Bill affords an opportunity to do so. Seize it.

The department yesterday said the investigation had shown the agreement between fisheries and Smit in 2005 to manage the vessels, and later extensions to the agreement, had failed to comply with tender board regulations, with procurement policies, National Treasury and income tax regulations and the Public Finance Management Act. A contract worth millions had been extended by a letter. Contracts signed in 2000, 2005 and 2010, amounting to between R1.6bn and R2bn, were irregular and drafted to have maximum benefit for Smit, the department said. The vessels include the fisheries research vessels and offshore patrol vessels. Smit lost the tender to manage the vessels last year. The department said there was ""substantial evidence of defrauding of the state"". Evidence against Smit and officials in the Department of Environment Affairs and the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries was ""overwhelming, indicating widespread complicity, corruption and deliberate entering of contracts unfavourable to the state"", the department said. It said the state had been defrauded of about R1.6bn through duplicate payments and invoices without tax or VAT. The investigation found that ""parties associated with Smit"" had moved documents to a warehouse to prevent the department and investigators from finding evidence. With law enforcement agents, the investigators were able to prevent the destruction of ""valuable data and contracts from government systems and |computers"". In some cases the department said the state had been billed for tens of millions of rand at a time when there was no evidence of Smit having provided any service to the state. ""There are instances where monies owing by Smit Amandla Marine to the state have been deliberately withheld with the assistance of complicit state officials in the Fisheries Branch,"" the department said. The former Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism had entered into the contract with Pentow Marine and Smit Marine, but there appeared to be no valid agreement between that department and Smit.

Public platforms such as Parliament and the provincial legislatures are democratic spaces that belong to the people of SA. This sentiment was displayed in the resolutions dealing with efforts to combat corruption which is threatening our collective efforts to eliminate poverty and inequality in our society. There is a breakdown in trust between citizens and the political elite, who have failed to live up to election promises. This is particularly true of those corrupt elected representatives who have used public office to enrich themselves, as manifested in the increasing number of reports of corruption, nepotism, financial mismanagement, tender fraud and administrative inefficiencies that cripple so many of our government departments and municipalities. Sadly, those involved in these corrupt practices come from the ranks of organised civil society formations, and the ANC-led alliance which Cosatu is part of it. Our participation in this congress as organised civil society formations and faith-based organisations was motivated by a vision of active citizenship partnership to strengthen the voice of the poor and the marginalised on issues such as the regulation of political party funding, the creation of a national framework to protect whistle-|blowers, the institutionalisation of an independent investigating authority to fight corruption, and the implementation of policy and legislation to deal with cartels and tender-rigging. The first welcome outcome of this congress is the reinforcement of the call for the regulation of political party funding in SA. This call is informed by the realisation that private money in politics is a critical site in the struggle for accountable governance. When wealthy elites can purchase power by secretly funding political parties in exchange for benefits - such as favourable legislation, policy choices, public tenders or administrative action - the poor and marginalised disproportionately pay the price. The ongoing debate affirms that political parties play a critical role in forming and representing democratic political will in our constitutional dispensation, as they do in all democracies. It also acknowledges the democratic imperative that political parties require sustainable sources of funding to undertake their legitimate and necessary tasks in an open and competitive democracy. However, the lack of political party funding regulation and disclosure, combined with parties' increasing demand for funds, has created in SA, as elsewhere, an unhealthy alliance between some in government and some private interests. And this is democratically unaccountable and provides fertile ground for corruption. For SA to meet the challenge of political and economic corruption, and to live up to its promise of |political equality and economic opportunity for all; it must combine strict, independent enforcement of existing anti-corruption laws with fundamental reform of the still-unregulated space of private funding of political parties. The second aspect of the debate is in relation to promoting and strengthening existing protection measures for whistle-blowers. The protective scope of existing laws is too narrow. Whistle-blowing is regulated by a splintered series of laws that apply varying obligations to public and private entities, and different levels of protection for different categories of whistle-blowers. The Cosatu resolutions will add weight to the current legislation reform process that will ensure a framework that includes bodies and organisations that could also effectively deal with complaints, but are outside the ambit of the offices of the public protector and the auditor- general. This will enable ordinary citizens at local level, including union members of the Cosatu affiliates, to engage actively in the fight against corruption. The test for Cosatu, an alliance partner of the ruling ANC, will now be on its ability to assert its |influence within the alliance, |especially in the area of fighting corruption. The result should unlock the impasse on issues such as the crippling delay, largely due to lack of ""political will"", in the implementation of the Competition Amendment Act 1 of 2009. Investigations by the Competition Commission since 2006 found that representatives of some companies have held telephone discussions and meetings prior to the submission of their respective tenders. In these ""private chats"" they collaborated over their responses, and discussed and agreed on prices. This concerned the manipulation of prices of basic food items, pharmaceutical and hospital products. In an environment where government is involved in the procurement of goods and services, and where the possibility for collusion and uncompetitive behaviour by companies applying for tenders is high, it is important that strong institutional checks and balances, as envisaged in the Competition Amendment Act, are implemented. Over the past years, Cosatu and civil society formations such as the Black Sash have taken a commendably strong stance against corruption, collusion and uncompetitive behaviour through submissions to the Competition Commission, Parliament, and the launch of the bread price-fixing class action case in the Western Cape High Court. The renewed commitment at this congress will enhance Zwelinzima Vavi's leadership role of the National Anti-Corruption Forum and the collective efforts of civil society, business, and government to combat corruption. It will also assist the African Union's Peer Review Mechanism in the fight against corruption in the continent. l Nyembezi is a Policy Analyst |and Advocacy Programme Manager for Black Sash."762,Cape Times (South Africa),11/8/2012,How the seeds of corruption find fertile ground with greedy B&B guests,E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (92%),Pg. 11,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,699 words,,9-Nov-12,,BED & BREAKFAST INNS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); RESTAURANTS (87%); FAST FOOD (75%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (59%) CapeTimes.Opinion,"DEAR Public Protector, You are quite right to be deeply concerned about ""false billing"" - making the state pay for goods and services that were never supplied.

But when guests don't stay as private individuals - when someone else is paying the bill - it's easy to ""fix"" the system, and the problem is most acute when government employees are involved. Smithfield, where I live, often hosts people on official short contracts. I became aware of the problems that could arise from the story of my neighbour who had a few such guests staying with her. Meals had become an issue: she's a good cook but the guests constantly moaned. She realised it might be a scam when they demanded she hand over the ""food money"" she would otherwise spend on their meals. By then she'd had such a rough time that she was happy to deliver the cash so the problem would go away. Next on the slippery slope are guests whose employer specifies a meal allowance: they will pay accommodation plus a certain amount for meals. Now some guests are routinely demanding this cash be handed over in full. It's a common, virtually standard practice for such guests to buy bread and chips for meals and pocket the balance. Other times guests whose employers stipulate a restaurant meal allowance to a certain amount insist on bringing a friend to meals. They ensure their combined bill is no less than the daily allowance. A colleague in the Eastern Cape tells of a common practice there: the relevant department covers her accommodation rate plus a R200 ""meal allowance"" that's way out of line. A couple of cold drinks plus a three-course meal cannot come to more than R130, even at the best eatery in town. The guest then buys cigarettes, cold drinks, takeaways, hamburgers - I kid you not, even though they have just eaten a full meal - to the value of whatever remains so that the money is all used. My worst experience concerned a group of young professionals who came to ""get a quote"" for an upcoming tour of duty in the town. Halfway through the negotiations, it became clear there was a subtext. They seemed to be suggesting that my rate was ""too low"" - a novel problem. It turned out they knew the highest amount payable for accommodation by their department. They had already obtained a quote from the most expensive places in town where the bill would be almost exactly the accommodation allowance. But they specifically wanted to stay at a place with a significant gap between the bill and the maximum allowed. Don't think they wanted to save taxpayers' money: their plan was to be billed for the utmost the department would pay and for the difference between my ""genuine"" bill and the ""false bill"" to be split between them and me. One of the guys said he chose where his team stayed when they were away on a job. If we could do this deal and make it an ongoing arrangement, he would make sure they always stayed with me in future. At this crucial point he had to leave, but he said he'd be back for my answer. So much money was involved that I expect he thought it was a done deal. I would have loved to see his face when he read my SMS saying he should immediately stop his illegal deal-making or I would report him. As he and his group were in town the next week on their assignment I presume he found a place more amenable to his proposals. What irked me most was this, however: they were employees of the Department of Justice - accountants, no less - in town to ensure the books of the local department were in order. Our message to you, Madam Public Protector is this: get cracking, find a way to stop these practices. We'll all be in your debt.

Northern Cape provincial chairman John Block's head could - if he is convicted - be one of the first to roll.

The ANC has also decided to set up within three months an integrity commission made up of veterans who would act as custodians of the moral values of the party. It would have the power to call before it any member, and any member could report unethical conduct. In an attempt to improve accountability, changes to the ANC's constitution include requiring members placed in government posts to sign contracts with the party. A member suspended from a government job and facing charges of financial misconduct will also have to undergo an ANC disciplinary hearing to determine whether their deployment contract with the party should be terminated.

David Lewis, head of the independent organisation, which is a year old this month, described this as the ""most disturbing form of corruption"" reported to them last year. ""This involves theft of funds, goods and equipment by principals and teachers. Even more disturbing are cases which indicate that parents, through school governing bodies, are also involved in corrupt awarding of tenders."" Lewis said fighting corruption in schools would be a key focus this year. ""We are asking the public to tell us more about what is happening at schools with regard to corruption. We would like to promote awareness and work together with communities to deal with this type of corruption."" Corruption Watch was launched in response to the rising number of corrupt acts reported to civil society organisations, and focuses on the abuse of public money by those in government and business. In a statement summing up the year's work, Lewis said the organisation had received 3 223 reports last year. While the corruption reports it had received could not on their own be taken to represent the state of corruption in the country, they did give insight into the nature and ways in which corruption manifested itself in people's lives. The highest incidence of corruption, which was among municipal officials, dealt mainly with the abuse of power and resources by public officials, particularly in the procurement of goods and services. They had reports of people channelling government money to their personal accounts, putting pressure on others to cover up their corrupt acts, and handing out money and food to secure votes in local elections. Reports of bribery in traffic departments dealt mainly with bribery on the roads and corruption in the licensing of drivers. The highest number of reports on corruption came from Gauteng, the region where Corruption Watch had been most active last year. Reports from small towns made up 42 percent of the total number of incidents reported to the organisation. ""It is the high number of reports from small towns that has been a concern. We believe that the reason for this is a lack of options and channels that people have for reporting and fighting corruption. There is limited access to media or to supportive NGOs and legal resources in those areas,"" Lewis said. Most people reported complaints using the SMS hotline (45 percent), and 34 percent reported on the Corruption Watch website. Most people who reported online did so anonymously and left no contact details. Lewis said the disadvantage of this was that it limited the organisation's ability to take the reports further.

At least seven staffers from MDC Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's press and research office have been arrested as well as top human rights lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa who was representing them. MDC insiders say the researchers were arrested as part of a faction fight within Zanu-PF. The team is believed to have uncovered gross corruption by some Zanu-PF ministers, and are suspected of leaking information to a daily newspaper and the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission. Another faction is accused of funding some connected to the commission and of ""sweetening"" some local journalists. Much of the drama and allegations of corruption surround the so-called ""indigenisation"" programme which has, so far, failed to materialise in real terms. The 51 percent shareholdings to be transferred to black Zimbabweans have to be paid for, and so far locals have not found the money to buy their majority shares in companies such as platinum giant, Zimplats, which is owned by South Africa's Implats. The police are also set to accuse the MDC of running an office funded by a US-funded NGO. This new crackdown on the MDC which was delayed until after a referendum on a new constitution, comes as President Robert Mugabe is expected to dissolve parliament in the next few weeks. His Zanu-PF justice minister Patrick Chinamasa says the elections must be held by June 29, when the present government expires. Chinamasa scoffed at speculation that the inclusive government would, in some way, be extended. ""It is imperative to have the elections by June 29 because we will no longer have a parliament by then and a country cannot be run without a parliament,"" he said. ""As the Minister of Justice and Legal Affairs, I am not entertaining the holding of the elections after June 29 unless circumstances beyond my control happen,"" he said."768,Cape Times (South Africa),4/10/2013,The government must stop dithering and deal decisively with corruption,E1 Edition,CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC (92%),Pg. 9,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,729 words,,11-Apr-13,"BANGUI, CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC (91%)",INVESTIGATIONS (89%); BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (87%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (87%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); FOREIGN POLICY (78%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (78%); DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS (78%); APPOINTMENTS (77%); PUBLIC FINANCE (72%); EMPLOYMENT (71%); TAX LAW (70%); CORRUPTION (65%); CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES CRIME (64%); TAX CONSULTING (63%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (59%) CapeTimes.Opinion,"One wonders whether many presidents would have survived the return of 13 soldiers in coffins after what seems like an ill-thought-through foreign policy jamboree by the SANDF in the Central African Republic (CAR). Yet, President Jacob Zuma, the ""teflon man"", survives repeatedly, protected by his party. We seem nowhere nearer to the truth than when the news first broke of our compatriots dying in far-off Bangui. From media reports it seems our troops were in trouble before the battle, or at least sensed something dangerous coming. Their messages to loved ones are poignant. Parliament, ever on the back-foot, can hardly be described as having exercised its oversight reactively in this matter. Even last week, the joint standing committee on defence cut its meeting short because MPs had ""planes to catch"". Clearly a national crisis - which is what these deaths are - cannot move parliamentarians from their executive-minded inertia, even with the minister of defence present. The DA's David Maynier seems to be the only MP who really wants to get to the bottom of the sad saga. The minister appears before the committee again on April 23. As citizens we deserve answers but most of all the families of the 13 dead deserve answers. Yet it seems as if our government is loath to be subjected to the accountability the constitution demands. But these are difficult times where in William Yeats's still apt but over-used words, ""The best lack all conviction, while the the worst are full of passionate intensity...' We read a City Press article in which phone records seem to reveal a conversation between Sars Commissioner, Oupa Magashula and a woman. Magashula seems to be in the company of a drug lord and allegedly makes the woman a job offer. Sars in its statement says it has ""no reason to doubt the integrity of the commissioner"". It also went on to confirm the authenticity of the recording which may turn out to be problematic for Magashula. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan acted quickly, announcing his intention to appoint a retired judge to investigate the matter. Gordhan must be livid that his commissioner has found himself in such a seemingly compromised position. Whatever the disagreements about policy, Gordhan, Trevor Manuel and Maria Ramos turned South African finance around and managed to fit all the crucial pieces of the jigsaw together into a competent revenue service and increased tax compliance. As long as there is increased compliance, a revenue service with integrity and a ministry of finance capable and skillful, we will be in a position to weather global financial storms. And that has proved to be largely so since 2008. The investigation into Magashula needs to happen swiftly and if the allegations are true, he must be dismissed without delay. South Africa can ill-afford a rotten Sars. Once the chink in the armour arises at the top, corruption and cronyism filters down to all levels. The credibility of Sars is at stake and the implications of a lack of credibility will affect business confidence and lead to increased arbitrage. Gordhan has acted more swiftly than his boss has against Minister of Communications, Dina Pule. She is presiding over a mess. Several members of the SABC board resigned, tales of nepotism and corruption abound with a ministry which seems no nearer to fulfilling its policy mandate than the day Pule took the job. Word has it that the directive had come from the bowels of Luthuli House for board members to resign. Whatever the truth of the matter, there is only one casualty and that must be the SABC and its mandate as a public broadcaster. The SABC remains a powerful tool for the government and the ANC, and so it comes as no surprise that there is meddling in its affairs whether overtly or covertly. A few months ago rumour had it that Zuma was about to axe Pule. Allegations against her include the awarding of a contract for ""management services"" to her boyfriend who also appears to be running the ministry from Sandton with a heavy hand in |appointments. Despite the allegations, nothing happened and there has been no investigation into Pule. Zuma is not known for his speed in these sorts of situations.

And former National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) boss Menzi Simelane is instrumental in setting it up. This emerged in Parliament yesterday when Public Service and Administration Minister Lindiwe Sisulu briefed MPs. Briefing Parliament's oversight committee on public service, Sisulu said this was part of the ANC's determination to crack down on corruption. She added that the scourge of corruption was particularly prevalent in governments that were still in transition. The bureau will: l Investigate corruption-related matters in all three spheres of government. l Conduct investigations and institute disciplinary proceedings on corruption-related matters in the public service. l Co-ordinate the conduct of disciplinary hearings on corruption including the appointment of presiding officers and employer representatives at hearings. l Provide specialised technical assistance and advisory support. l Manage, co-ordinate and protect information and sources. l Facilitate the protection of whistle-blowers. l Refer evidence of criminality to the NPA.

The department's special anti-corruption unit would be disbanded to make way for the new entity. Sisulu said the anti-corruption bureau was the answer because her department's ""small entity"" did not have the capacity and legal authority required to fight corruption effectively.

Mahapa said the bureau, for which her department would be responsible, was looking for a ""high-profile"" corruption buster to lead it.

In two applications before the Western Cape High Court, Glenister and the Helen Suzman Foundation are challenging the SAPS Amendment Act, which effectively amended the South African Police Service Act last year. This came after Glenister successfully challenged a part of the SAPS Act, with the Constitutional Court allowing 18 months for the legislature to fix it. But yesterday, advocate Paul Hoffman, SC, acting for Glenister, argued before a full Bench of the high court - made up of judges Siraj Desai, Andre le Grange and Judith Cloete - that even though the legislation governing the Hawks had been amended, these ""tweaks"" remained incompatible with the constitution. That anti-corruption entity, he said, needed to be free of executive control, more specifically that of the minister of police, as was the case for structures such as the National Prosecuting Authority and the Independent Police Investigative Directorate. Hoffman argued that the Hawks, tasked with investigating allegedly corrupt citizens, fell under the management and control of the national commissioner, whose direction came from the minister. In order to secure the necessary independence, he said, the anti-corruption entity needed to be ""impregnable"" to undue executive interference. ""The scheme of the 2012 legislation does not achieve a state, a structure or an operational environment in which the Hawks are so 'secured'. This is unconstitutional,"" one of Hoffman's documents read. ""They 'fall under' the police hierarchy and are not adequately independent."" He further said that in terms of the Concourt's ruling, the ""factual circumstances"" of the executive, the Hawks (pre-2012) and the police service needed to be taken into account when determining what the appropriate degree of independence was. The Helen Suzman Foundation, which is taking a different, more narrow legal approach, is arguing that the amendments to the SAPS Act still fail to meet constitutional standards with regard to an independent anti-corruption entity. Advocate David Unterhalter, SC, for the foundation, has so far argued on the issue of the appointment of Hawks members. The appointment of the head was a ministerial decision based on the minister's discretion, he argued, and Parliament had no power to veto, scrutinise or reject the appointment. Unterhalter questioned whether there could be satisfaction that such an appointment was free of any taint of ministerial preferment. He is to continue his arguments today.

In other words, assume for a moment that the Hawks or Scorpions or Ants or Tripe or whatever biological creature investigated President Jacob Zuma were taking orders from his political enemies. They wanted him to never ever become president of South Africa. That was their chief aim. What, legally, follows from this? Nothing dramatic follows. A political motive behind a legally winnable corruption case should mean that the case can still go to court. This is because society has an overriding interest in not being stolen from, not being broken. This social interest is surely greater than the potentially corrupt individual's irritation with the motive of some of the investigators, especially if the investigators sit on real evidence of prima facie corruption. And we know, in fact, they do have such evidence in this case because before the charges were dropped against Zuma the prosecuting authority told us it had evidence of a quality good enough to justify bringing the charges. The only thing left is to spell out more precisely why a political motive behind a winnable case is irrelevant (for the benefit of one Mokotedi Mpshe who dropped the charges). I confess I also once held the mistaken view that if there's a wicked motive behind a case (that is, a motive not related to the pursuit of justice), then the case should be dropped. My instinct was twofold: wickedly motivated cases incentivise investigators to abuse the legal system if we do not throw such cases out when they come to light. Furthermore, the integrity of the justice system requires that the system operate on the basis of honourable motives just as society is expected to behave. And, obviously, the prosecution of people on the basis of non-legal motives undermines the integrity of the legal system because it erodes the honour at the heart of the system. Or so I argued a few years ago. I have no clue if this is what Mpshe thought also. He cited some dodgy Hong Kong case as an authority on which he relied for his decision. It turned out, of course, that that was a case that was actually overturned on appeal (and this fact, by the way, is itself a good reason why Mpshe's decision should be set aside!) But let's say, for argument's sake, Mpshe also actually holds the twofold reasons that I did a few years back. Here is why he would be wrong, just as I have turned out to be wrong upon reflection. The ""integrity of the legal system"" must be weighed against the need for justice on the part of the aggrieved party. In this case, the aggrieved party is society, from whom possibly billions had been stolen. It would be weird to have a blanket rule that says one should always drop cases that stem from non-legal motives and ignore the right to access justice on the part of individuals, or society, who had been wronged. The question then is one of how to weigh the need to ensure we don't encourage the abuse of the legal system for political purposes, while allowing society to exact justice from corrupt individuals. Well, in this particular case, and no doubt in many similar cases, it makes sense to push ahead with the main corruption case despite the political motives of investigators. This is because the legal system, overall, contains mechanisms that Zuma can appeal to in order to deal with the political motive part of the saga. First, and something Mpshe should not have missed, nothing stops Zuma, say, from suing the state or anyone out to damage his name or career illegally. A case of this kind would ensure Zuma gets compensated for any illegal actions against him. But this case could run at the same time as a case in which Zuma faces evidence of prima facie corruption. Then Zuma can get justice and society can get justice. The integrity of the legal system would be ensured, and society's intrinsic interest in substantive justice would be protected. Second, if there's a case to answer in law, then the political motives of some investigators do not undermine the legal system's integrity fatally - not to an extent that justifies pretending there's no case to answer. Third, from Zuma's perspective, the only good legal complaint would be a fear that he will not get a fair trial. But because the politically motivated investigators are not the judges who decide the case, no basis for fearing a fair trial exists. Mpshe exercised his discretion for sure, but his reasoning lacked sufficient legal merit. I predict our highest court will eventually say so too."775,Cape Times (South Africa),8/28/2013,"Mthethwa lashed over corruption, police inefficiency",E2 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (92%),NEWS; Pg. 1,CT,Newspaper, Xolani Koyana,ENGLISH,192 words,,28-Aug-13,,TALKS & MEETINGS (91%); CORRUPTION (90%); POLICE MISCONDUCT (89%); POLICE FORCES (79%); PUBLIC HEARINGS (78%); DRUG POLICY (77%); SHOOTINGS (66%) CapeTimes.News,"POLICE Minister Nathi Mthethwa bore the brunt of public dissatisfaction with the police at a meeting in Mitchells Plain yesterday with residents complaining about inefficiency and corruption.

Present at the meeting were Mthethwa's deputy Maggie Sotyu, Community Safety MEC Dan Plato, provincial police Commissioner Arno Lamoer and mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith. Activist Fikile Mbambi told Mthethwa he had attended many of the minister's public meetings, complaining about police corruption and brutality, but the minister was yet to take up any of those issues. Gadija Skippers, who lives in an open field near the Kapteinsklip train station, said she lived in fear for her children. They live with relatives in Rocklands, not far from the field.

They had been arrested for possession of illegal firearms and drugs. He said they were affiliated to gangs, something which could be avoided if their parents played their role. ""It's well and good to say authorities must do something but we must also pose a question: what happened to us as parents that we go to bed at night and our 10 or 11-year-old is not around at home? Should that be the responsibility of the government? This problem is big and needs all of us to work together,"" said Mthethwa. The problem of gangsterism and drugs could not be solved by the police, and the provincial government should take responsibility for providing basic services to communities affected by gangs.

Jiang, a director of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, was being probed for ""serious disciplinary violations"", Xinhua said, citing the party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. Jiang is the highest-profile official investigated since President Xi Jinping took over the ruling party in November last year, vowing to crack down on graft which he said threatened its six-decade hold on power. Focusing on the oil industry and the state-owned companies Jiang oversaw might help Xi and Premier Li Keqiang push through economic policies at a November conclave, said Willy Wo-Lap Lam of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Lam said: ""Because there is so much money around, it is not surprising that the oil industry is perhaps fertile ground for corruption. Xi and Li will subject these huge conglomerates to more intense scrutiny - this is a way to impose some sort of discipline."" Zhou Yongkang, a former China National Petroleum Corporation general manager in the 1990s who until last year oversaw the country's internal security forces, was also being investigated, the South China Morning Post said at the weekend, citing unidentified sources. Jiang and Zhou's career paths crossed in the oil industry, where they worked for more than three decades. Other officials being investigated by the discipline commission include Liu Tienan, the vice-chairman of the country's planning agency, who was expelled from the party in August last year after being fired in May after a probe began. Li Chuncheng, a deputy party secretary of Sichuan province, was put under investigation in December, Xinhua reported at the time. Party leaders agreed to investigate Zhou because of rising anger in the party at the scale of corruption and the vast fortune amassed by his family, the South China Morning Post said. Jiang is not the first top oil executive to face punishment.

The session was held to|discuss the role of religious leaders ahead of next year's elections. Peter Storey, former Bishop of the Methodist Church of South Africa, delivered the hard-hitting keynote address to which Mpho Tutu, who heads her parents Desmond and Leah Tutu's Legacy Foundation, responded. Storey said less than two decades into democracy, South Africa's new flag had ""already gathered numerous grubby stains due to the actions of a democratically-elected government"". He pointed to a number of choices which had affected the lives of millions, including: l The Arms Deal which cost ""untold billions that could and should have been used for lifting our people out of poverty"". l Aids denialism under former president Thabo Mbeki. l An Education Department which produced new ""lost generations"" caused by failure in leadership and teachers who placed their own interests ahead of their pupils. ""Looming over all these, of course, is the most intractable issue of them all: poverty and joblessness, exacerbated by the pandemic crime wave visited upon private citizens in townships and suburbs, and the looting of the public purse through corruption."" Storey said the official response had been troubling. ""We wait in vain for just one word of inspiration, direction and leadership, to address these crises, but government invests its energies in protecting itself from exposure."" He hoped a new generation of spiritual leaders would hold the government accountable. ""The first flush of democracy has faded and the tawdriness and venality of much of our present political scene is undeniable. Corruption is a direct robbing of the poor and can no longer be ignored."" Storey said as the elections approached, politicians would come ""shopping for votes"". ""Our concerns will suddenly become important again, candidates will attend houses of worship and demand to speak. Some weak-kneed clerics will let them, others will have the backbone to say, 'No'."" He encouraged fellow theologians to not be seen favouring a political party as the election loomed. Tutu said gains had been made in the delivery of basic services. ""But at the same time we have witnessed many of the very politicians whom we believed could virtually walk on water sinking in the quicksand of personal aggrandisement and greed. ""Many South Africans continue to live miserable lives; infants die preventable deaths due to poor sanitation - no women or children are safe from the scourge of sexual |predation that seems to have beset us."" Tutu said it was the role of religious leaders to criticise and applaud politicians where appropriate. ""But our applause is only meaningful when it is trustworthy... it is impossible to trust the words of faith leaders who speak from the back pocket of a political party rather than as representatives of the community, particularly the most marginalised.""

A Solidarity statement said: ""An ex-member of the Scorpions, two members of the Hawks and several SAPS|members have been summoned to testify in the controversial case."" Roos, previously an internal auditor in Crime Intelligence and responsible for auditing the Secret Service account, wants to be reinstated after being transferred to another section in the division. According to court papers, he discovered fraud relating to the Secret Service account and after initially being authorised to investigate it, was instead transferred. Earlier this week, while Solidarity had been ready for a trial, police asked that the case be postponed. The application for the postponement was heard yesterday and a decision on whether or not a settlement could be reached was expected. Afterwards, Dirk Groenewald, head of Solidarity's Centre for Fair Labour Practice, said: ""The Labour Court granted the application for a postponement and set the case for trial from 10 to 21 February 2014."" The court also ordered that police pay the legal costs Solidarity incurred as a result of the postponement. Groenewald said it was ""clear"" that former Crime Intelligence head Richard Mdluli, previously suspended for matters relating to his time as the division's head, would be the police's chief witness. Solidarity's statement said: ""Colonel Roos, who has worked for the SAPS for 26 years, is currently stationed at the inspection and evaluation division of the Crime Intelligence Unit.

These are some of the findings of a special report by the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence into the Nkandla security upgrades, which was released yesterday. The findings were drawn from the Department of Public Works Task Team report into the controversial upgrades. It was released hours before the security cluster ministers abandoned their court case against Public Protector Thuli Madonsela, which was supposed to have been heard today. The 36-page report paints a disturbing picture of the flouting of mandatory procurement requirements, with a number of companies having been awarded tenders without going ""through the security clearance process"". ""Supply chain management policy and prescripts were not fully complied with (in) the procurement of goods and services related to the project,"" the report reads.

The committee report confirms the R206m spent on the Nkandla upgrades, but exonerates the department. ""There is no evidence that the department paid for the construction of houses of the president,"" the committee found. The committee condemned the launching of ""parallel"" investigations, saying unnecessary costs were incurred as the department had already launched internal investigations. The report is mostly dedicated to justifying and listing ""compelling"" crime factors - especially rape - for the Nkandla security upgrades. ""Rape is reported as being particularly on the rise, among other crimes. This is but one of the factors that necessarily place an obligation on government to tighten security even more."" It also raises fears of a political assassination because of ""a volatile political situation"" in Nkandla.

Foreign donors, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the British government, have suspended aid that finances about 40 percent of the nation's budget after reports of rampant corruption and abuse of public funds. The scandal, dubbed ""Cashgate"" by local papers, led Banda to dissolve her cabinet on October 10 and appoint international investigators to probe the allegations. ""This is my fight, this is our fight as a nation, as Malawians,"" Banda said in an interview in Kuwait after attending an Arab-Africa summit. ""We intend to implement it with or without donors because it's our nation, our people that suffer as a result. This is a cancer."" The scandal and suspension of aid threaten to derail an economic revival that has been under way since last year when Banda succeeded Bingu wa Mutharika, who died in office last April. The IMF said it had delayed the disbursement of $20 million (R203m) to Malawi ""until the fiscal situation could be clarified and necessary corrective measures put in place."" Economic growth would probably be curtailed to 5 percent this year from an earlier forecast of 5.8 percent, while inflation was projected to average 28.5 percent, she said.

If I don't go back to State House because I was trying to do this, that's fine. I've placed this before my political career.""

""SA's stable index scores can be attributed to the level of outrage expressed by the public in the form of service delivery protests and eagerness to report corruption to independent civil society-based organisations like Corruption Watch,"" the organisation said. ""The perceptions are also indicative of a public that has become intolerant of the abuse of public resources and is losing trust in political, public and business leadership."" The Corruption Perceptions Index compiled by Transparency International revealed yesterday that South Africa fell to joint 72nd out of 177 countries this year from 69th last year. A country's score indicates the perceived level of corruption in its public sector on a scale of zero to 100, where zero means the public sector is perceived as totally corrupt. The rank indicates a country's position relative to other countries surveyed for the index. South Africa scored 42 points in 2013, below the minimum acceptable score of 50 and down from 43 last year. The report said 90 percent of African states and two-thirds of all countries scored below 50, indicating a ""serious, worldwide corruption problem"". The index ranks countries by the public's perception of public sector corruption and is the most widely used indicator of official graft globally. It made use of data from reputable organisations such the African Development Bank and the World Bank through the use of 13 surveys to compile the report. South Africa was on a par with countries such as Brazil and Serbia, but scored lower than other African countries such as Botswana and Rwanda. Somalia, North Korea and Afghanistan were the nations perceived to be most corrupt, scoring 8 points. Corruption Watch executive director David Lewis said corruption had negative impacts on the country's international image and also on sentiment among citizens. ""Over the last couple of years the levels of corruption have increased dramatically, but if you wanted to be optimistic you could say it's the first time the perception of corruption seems to be stabilising,"" he said. Lewis said the direct costs of corruption were the money lost to it, including impacts on investment. The indirect impacts were the decline in trust of leaders and a general acceptance of the situation as it is. ""One of the biggest drivers of corruption is the poorly managed procurement system,"" he said. He said that apathy among citizens was a danger because ""once people accept corruption then nothing can be done"". South Africa is no stranger to corruption controversies in the public sector with scandals that have seen many public officials stand trial for crimes related to mismanagement and self-enrichment. Renovations to President Jacob Zuma's homestead in Nkandla to the tune of R208 million are also alleged to be marred by corruption leading the saga to be dubbed ""Nkandlagate"". Corruption charges against Zuma were dropped by the National Prosecuting Authority. In July Transparency International released the Global Corruption Barometer, revealing that 47 percent of South Africans had paid bribes over the past year against a global average of 27 percent. Last month the auditor-general's report for the year to March showed that there were ""small improvements"" in government spending patterns. Unauthorised expenditure totalled R30.8 billion, which was almost R3bn better than the previous year, auditor-general Terence Nombembe said."788,Cape Times (South Africa),1/13/2014,Dissent rocks Amcu's rank and file; zz Allegations of corruption and violence drive worker anger,E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (92%),BUSINESS REPORT; Pg. 11,CT,Newspaper, Dineo Faku,ENGLISH,461 words,,13-Jan-14,,MINE WORKERS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); PLATINUM GROUP METALS MINING (90%); MINES & MINING (90%); LABOR UNIONS (89%); POLITICAL PARTIES (89%); LAYOFFS (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (78%); WAGES & SALARIES (72%) Business,"A STORM over the airwaves this weekend revealed that the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) is losing its grip on power in the platinum sector. A call was made on Metro FM for the formation of a new labour movement by disgruntled Amcu members, who have accused the union's leadership of derailing the course of workers. Instead they were driving a union marred by corruption and violence, and a cozy relationship with employers. Thebe Maswabi, Amcu's chairman at Anglo American Platinum's Thembelani mine, speaking on the station, said workers were mobilising for a new union that would have their interests closer to heart. In reference to Amcu president Joseph Mathunjwa, he said: ""Why are we paying Mathunjwa a salary? He is using the workers to enrich himself. He is not helping the workers; they are suffering. The workers need support and direction. They are tired and they need a leader who can speak for them and Mathunjwa is not doing his job properly."" Amcu national organiser Dumisani Nkalitshana hastily convened a belligerent press briefing, at which he hit back at those making accusations against Mathunjwa. Nkalitshana blamed Maswabi and disgruntled union members from Lonmin and Impala Platinum for sabotaging the union. ""People must understand that Amcu never promised anything but providing services to help members in instances of unfair labour practices, and so far we have delivered on our mandate."" The call for a new union comes as Amcu, the biggest union in the platinum sector, squabbles for membership with the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). Workers had become disillusioned with both the unions, analysts said. Amcu members behind the call for the formation of a new union were calling themselves a workers' committee and wanted more control and transparency in the union, Terry Bell, a labour commentator, said yesterday. The union was unlikely to have an impact on the labour movement in the mining sector because most of its members were retrenched workers who were bitter about their job losses. ""There will be no immediate impact if a new union is formed. We are going to find a continued weakness in the NUM, and a further weakening of Amcu. This will only benefit the National Union of Metalworkers of SA [Numsa],"" Bell added. In Rustenburg and Carletonville, disgruntled Amcu members have alleged favouritism and corruption. Weizmann Hamilton, of the interim committee of the Workers and Socialist Party, said: ""Amcu has turned what was a historical decision by mineworkers to abandon the NUM into a missed opportunity. Members are finding that the union is not what they were hoping that it would be."" There was a strong possibility that mineworkers would join Numsa, which had broken ties with the ruling party."789,Cape Times (South Africa),1/21/2014,Madibeng 'corruption': DA vows to bring in the big guns,E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (92%),NEWS; Pg. 5,CT,Newspaper, Baldwin Ndaba,ENGLISH,235 words,,21-Jan-14,,INVESTIGATIONS (91%); CORRUPTION (91%); POLICE MISCONDUCT (88%); WOUNDS & INJURIES (77%); SHOOTINGS (77%); GUNSHOT WOUNDS (74%) News,"MADIBENG: DA parliamentary leader Lindiwe Mazibuko has vowed to rope in Public Protector Thuli Madonsela to probe ""rampant corruption"" in the Madibeng municipality.

This week Murray, a former social activist during apart-heid, launched his self-titled retrospective which features photographs of his artwork through his 30-year career. Near the end of the book is the original artwork of The Spear - the painting of President Jacob Zuma with his genitals exposed which unleashed a political uproar. The painting was exhibited at Johannesburg's Goodman Gallery in May 2012. It prompted responses from political parties and scores of individuals who labelled it racist and a violation of Zuma's right to dignity. Zuma and the ruling party applied for an interdict to have The Spear portrait removed from the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg and two men were arrested for defacing the painting. At the beginning of the chapter ""Hail to the Thief"", Murray wrote that government corruption had led to the exhibition, which included The Spear, of the same name. Murray, whose iconic artwork and poster images were used widely by anti-apartheid organisations during the 1980s, said: ""It was with equal measures of disappointment and anger that I have expressed my contempt for some in the new regime who are undermining the victories that have been achieved through their corruption and guile, and who are effectively desecrating the graves of our Struggle heroes. Their persistent venality exposes a callous disregard for the continued poverty of many South Africans."" He defended his right to use satire to comment on the government. ""Political correctness and self-censorship are not cornerstones of effective political satire. If they were it would not be called satire, rather 'Ironic Praise Singing'. ""Parody is part of the satirist's arsenal and it is through this that I hope to expose the new pigs at the trough.."" Murray wrote: ""That some temporary custodians of our constitutional democracy saw fit to jackboot through a gallery space and call for the burning of an exhibition and suppress a newspaper editor's independence and by proxy attempt to censure the ideas of artists, playwrights, poets, film-makers, social commentators, stand-up comics and the like - and coming so soon after the apartheid regime's endeavours to do the same - was eye opening, reckless and ultimately chilling."" Murray, at the launch of the book, thanked Zuma for his fame. ""A few years ago I might have called (book publishers) Jacana and asked if they would be interested in publishing my coffee-table book. They would have asked: 'Brett who?' ""So it's ironic that I have the current leaders of our democracy to thank for the leg-up they've given me,"" he was quoted as having said by The Times yesterday."791,Cape Times (South Africa),2/4/2014,"Corruption rife in most of EU, survey finds",E2 Edition,EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (95%); EUROPE (94%); BELGIUM (92%); SPAIN (92%); ITALY (92%); GREECE (90%); DENMARK (90%); ROMANIA (79%); CZECH REPUBLIC (79%); FINLAND (79%); LITHUANIA (79%); NORDIC COUNTRIES (58%),Pg. 2,CT,Newspaper, Martin Santa and |John O'Donnell  Reuters,ENGLISH,303 words,EUROPEAN COMMISSION (84%); TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL (56%),4-Feb-14,"BRUSSELS, BELGIUM (92%)",EUROPEAN UNION (92%); CORRUPTION (90%); POLLS & SURVEYS (90%); EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (78%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (78%); POLITICS (76%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (72%); RULE OF LAW (72%) News,"BRUSSELS: Corruption is a problem for almost half the companies doing business in Europe, a survey by the European Commission has found, and an increasing number of EU citizens think it is getting worse. The report casts the EU, often portrayed as one of the globe's cleanest regions, in an unflattering light. Among businesses, the belief is widespread that the only way to succeed is through political connections. Experiences of corruption vary across the 28-country bloc. Almost all companies in Greece, Spain and Italy believe it is widespread, according to the report, the first by the commission. Corruption is considered rare in Denmark, Finland and Sweden. This mirrors the finding of Transparency International's corruption perception index. It named Greece as the worst performer in the EU, sharing 80th place with China. Denmark was seen as the least corrupt. ""Corruption undermines citizens' confidence in democratic institutions and the rule of law, it hurts the European economy and deprives states of much-needed tax revenue,"" said Cecilia Malmstrom, EU Commissioner for Home Affairs. Construction companies, which often tender for government contracts, are the most affected. Almost eight in 10 of those asked complained about corruption. Forty-three percent of companies see corruption as a problem. The cost to the European economy is estimated by the commission to be e120 billion a year, almost the size of the Romanian economy. The report says belief that corruption is commonplace is also widespread among EU citizens. A growing number believe it has become worse in recent years.

Corruption Watch said that its report last year profiled the extent of corruption based on information provided by the public and gained through a survey of people who contacted the organisation. ""The number of cases representing actual corruption - understood as abuse of public power and resources for personal gain - increased from 38 percent in 2012 to 58 percent in 2013.""

""In our first year, in 2012, we had 3 223 reports, which mostly fell outside of our area of focus.

In a survey last year, Corruption Watch found that more than 90 percent of those who reported corruption to the organisation were African, 81 percent were between the ages of 30 and 59, and 74 percent were men. The average person who files a report is self-employed or employed in the public sector and lives in Gauteng. They have completed secondary schooling at least, and are likely to have obtained a tertiary qualification. The group said: ""Because our corruption fighters like to get their information through radio, television and internet, it is probable that they heard about Corruption Watch from those sources."" Corruption Watch is a non-profit organisation that was launched in 2012. It relies on the public to report corruption to it and uses the reports as an important source to fight corruption. It investigates selected reports of alleged acts of corruption and hands over its findings to the authorities to take further action. The annual report says the reporting trends from 2012 and last year by province have slightly shifted, with Gauteng topping the charts at 38 percent, down from 46 percent in 2012. KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape followed closely at 13 percent, up from 10 percent and 8 percent, respectively. The Free State was the province with the most significant increase, from 7 percent in 2012 to 14 percent last year. In 2012, South Africa was ranked 69th out of íÁ countries on Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index, which measures perceived levels of public sector corruption in a number of countries. Last year, South Africa slid down to 72nd out of the 177 countries. Corruption Watch said of this: ""This may not be a massive fall but it is an indicator of a steady decline and South Africa's tarnished reputation for corrupt behaviour."" The organisation says the landscape of corruption in the government shifted significantly last year. Reports of corruption in local and national government make this an area of concern for Corruption Watch. It says since its inception in 2012, 661, or 12 percent, of the reports it received related to allegations of corruption in schools.

Corruption Watch noted that those who reported corruption were concerned their comments were falling on deaf ears.

Several dealers said Nigeria's foreign exchange, bond and money markets had stopped trading because of the uncertainty and volatility created by the suspension. Sanusi, who was due to end his term in June, had been presenting evidence to parliament that he said showed the state oil company, Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), had failed to remit $20 billion (R220bn) that it owed to federal government coffers. NNPC has repeatedly denied Sanusi's allegations. Deputy governor Sarah Alade was appointed acting governor, the presidential spokesman, Reuben Abati, said. ""Lamido Sanusi's tenure has been characterised by various acts of financial recklessness... inconsistent with the administration's vision of a Central Bank propelled by the core values of focused economic management,"" Abati said, without providing details of the acts.

Asked whether it was politically motivated, he said: ""It's not for me to comment. I think the answer to that is obvious."" Analysts predicted that foreign investors would now be active sellers of assets in Nigeria's economy, just when it was attracting more interest than ever for the huge potential of its 170 million population and a backlog of work needed to update its inadequate infrastructure. ""The suspension will come as a significant shock to foreign portfolio investors, whose willingness to invest in Nigeria was very much influenced by the transparency and anti-inflation credibility associated with Sanusi's policies,""|said Razia Khan, head of Africa research at Standard Chartered. If Jonathan wants to remove Sanusi entirely, he needs the consent of a simple majority of the Senate.

He obtained partial success in the Pietermaritzburg High Court, where Judge Isaac Madondo said the words in the act, that an accused ""ought reasonably to have known"", were a stretch too far to pass constitutional muster. But yesterday, the Constitutional Court unanimously rejected this and, in effect, gave South Africa's severe anti-organised crime laws a clean bill of health. In a judgment penned by Justice Mbuyiseli Madlanga, the court found that the definition of ""pattern of racketeering activity"" was quite clear. While laws must be written in clear and accessible terms, this did not require perfect lucidity. The acceptable standard was no higher than reasonable certainty. The court also ruled that ""overbreadth"" was not grounds on its own for challenging the constitutional validity of a statute. And the phrase, ""ought to reasonably have known"", said the court, captured the idea of negligence, and there was nothing constitutionally objectionable about it. The criminal case will be back in court in January next year, when a trial date is expected to be set. It is believed Savoi might apply for a permanent stay of prosecution before then. In another matter involving racketeering laws, the State has applied for leave to appeal against the judgment of a Durban High Court judge in favour of suspended KwaZulu-Natal Hawks head Major-General Johan Booysen that effectively stopped his prosecution. Judge Trevor Gorven ruled that there appeared to be no evidence to charge Booysen with racketeering linked to allegations that he headed a death squad in the now-disbanded Cato Manor organised crime unit. The matter will be argued next week."800,Cape Times (South Africa),3/26/2014,'Take parties to task' over corruption,E2 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (92%),NEWS,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,163 words,,26-Mar-14,,CORRUPTION (93%); POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS (90%); POLITICAL PARTIES (90%); POLITICS (90%); JUDGES (88%) CapeTimes.News,"DURBAN: South Africans needed to take the campaign against corruption to the political parties they support, retired Constitutional Court judge Zakeria Yacoob said yesterday.

He said apart from voters holding their political parties accountable, the government needed to make serious efforts to reduce corruption. ""It is the worst form of treason,"" he said.

Motlanthe said it could take something as small as a couple of rugby tickets for public representatives to be caught up in a corrupt relationship. Addressing a May Day celebration in the Port Elizabeth township of Zwide yesterday, Motlanthe said people should think twice before accepting random gifts from people. He said with the country's ""limited resources"", South Africa could not afford it. ""Corruption is a very simple problem. Its frontline soldiers are gifts. ""You see when you work as a councillor, or MEC, or minister, or deputy president, once there are people who come with tickets to a rugby final and leave them with you, you must be aware of the consequences."" He said such people didn't ask for favours immediately. ""They won't ask you for any favours at the time. But one day, the same person, while you are sitting at the counter, will find themselves at the back of a long queue and wave at you. And you must make a plan for him to come to the front. That's corruption. It has started. ""It doesn't announce itself with drum majorettes. It happens bit by bit. Small gifts. So you must be aware and conscious to not accept these."" Motlanthe shifted his focus to employers, saying all they wanted was a workforce that was ""not in solidarity so they can take advantage and suck your blood"". ""That is why it's important for workers to be in solidarity. You must be united in order for you to raise your issues. Employers have no shame. They will abuse you,"" he said. Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi said corruption should not be looked for outside the tripartite alliance. ""Corruption is here inside the house. It's here in the unions. In the SACP, look inside and not outside,"" |he warned. Vavi earlier slammed the ""phenomenon"" of the ""continuous importation of greed, survival of the fittest and dog-eat-dog capitalist culture into our movement""."802,Cape Times (South Africa),5/6/2014,Corruption grows where there is no independent crime fighter,E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (79%),Pg. 9,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,605 words,,8-May-14,,LAW ENFORCEMENT (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); CORRUPTION (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (77%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (76%); LITIGATION (76%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (76%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (76%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (73%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (73%); POLICE FORCES (67%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (59%) CapeTimes.Opinion,"The SCORPIONS came into operation in January 2001. By January 2009, they were disbanded. Many believed it had a lot to do with the pursuit of the then deputy president of the ANC and the country, Jacob Zuma. The Scorpions were relentless. And they had powerful enemies. Their mandate was to deal with high-level crimes of national impact. This meant a lot of powerful people got into trouble and were caught by the country's most effective crime-fighting operation. Many felt targeted and felt the Scorpions were used to settle political scores. By the time it was disbanded, the outfit had a 90 percent conviction rate. No wonder so many powerful people wanted the Scorpions gone. The outfit was squashed quickly when Kgalema Motlanthe became president after Thabo Mbeki was recalled. It was a smart move to make Motlanthe do it because if Zuma had done it when he became president, it would have looked like payback. The new administration set up a unit to replace the Scorpions, the Hawks, which were under the police. Unfortunately, the Constitutional Court had another view. In March 2011, Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke delivered the majority judgment which had been prepared with Justice Edwin Cameron. The court ruled that ""the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (the Hawks) is insufficiently insulated from political interference"". The judgment did not disband the Hawks or reinstate the Scorpions as some may have hoped, but gave Parliament another opportunity to create a ""constitutionally valid"" crime-fighting and corruption-busting unit. President Zuma is now arguing that if the Hawks were an independent unit outside the police force, there would be no accountability. In the Hawks judgment, the justices argued the case for the principle of separation of powers and wrote: ""Its inception in our constitutional jurisprudence can be traced back to Constitutional Principle VI, which is one of the principles which governed the drafting of our Constitution. It proclaimed that: (t)here shall be a separation of powers between the legislature, executive and judiciary, with appropriate checks and balances to ensure accountability, responsiveness and openness."" The Scorpions operated under constitutionally valid conditions and performed their duties just fine back then, until they were deemed to be too efficient. The Hawks as they stand today are a unit in the SAPS that reports to the Ministry of Safety and Security; this means they are in effect directed by the executive. It would be easy for the executive to shield itself if it were involved in shady dealings if the same unit that might investigate it reports to it. In paragraph 35 of the ruling of the unconstitutionality of the Hawks, the judgment reads: ""The principle of checks and balances focuses on the desirability that the constitutional order, as a totality, prevent the branches of government from usurping power from one another."" If the Hawks report to the minister, a member of the executive, it is easy to see how the powers of the Hawks could be directed by the executive. The Scorpions on the other hand were a unit of the National Prosecuting Authority and were independent of the executive as a result. The paragraph submitted by the president: ""However serious the threat of corruption and however dire the need for an independent DPCI (Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation) to avoid government shielding itself against policing of corrupt members, the Hawks cannot be an absolutely independent stand-alone unit,"" tells us they would rather have the threat of corruption than have a stand-alone unit which fights corruption."803,Cape Times (South Africa),5/12/2014,Corruption and political impotence at the centre,E1 Edition,NIGERIA (98%); CANADA (92%); SOUTH AFRICA (92%); AFRICA (92%); FRANCE (73%),Pg. 11,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,561 words,WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM (57%),12-May-14,"CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA (79%); ABUJA, NIGERIA (78%)",BOKO HARAM (92%); NIGERIAN SCHOOLGIRL KIDNAPPINGS (90%); KIDNAPPING & ABDUCTION (90%); CORRUPTION (83%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (78%); REBELLIONS & INSURGENCIES (72%); ARMED FORCES (72%); SALES & SELLING (71%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (71%); WAR & CONFLICT (70%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (68%); TERRORISM (67%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (64%); MUSLIMS & ISLAM (61%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (59%) CapeTimes.Opinion,"It took a long time - nearly a month - for Boko Haram's abduction of about 230 Nigerian schoolgirls to become an international issue. Now everyone is talking about it or even doing something about it. The US, UK, France, Canada and China have all pledged some sort of military assistance, indirect it seems, at least so far. Is this a success or failure for Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan? Perhaps he believes he has succeeded because the world has now recognised his problem. And yet the episode also detracted dramatically from his hosting of the World Economic Forum's Africa summit in Abuja last week. That had been switched from its usual venue in Cape Town to Nigeria this year to coincide with Nigeria's overtaking South Africa as Africa's largest economy. But instead of focusing on that achievement, the summit coverage was mostly about the abduction of the schoolgirls. And that also threw light on Nigeria's inept handling of the Boko Haram problem. Of course anyone can become a victim of the kind of completely ruthless, brutal terrorism carried out by Boko Haram. And, despite the sudden flurry of pledges from mainly Western powers to help Nigeria rescue the girls, it is hard to imagine how anyone is going to be able to do much about it. If any rescuers get close to the abductors, there must be a real chance that they will simply kill the girls. Yet the chances of rescue might have been higher if Nigerian special forces had struck earlier, before Boko Haram could divide up the girls into smaller groups, and start selling them off as ""brides"", as they are now suspected to have done. But Jonathan's real culpability goes back to before the girls were abducted; to his handling of Boko Haram over the last four years since its insurgency began. In a report published last month the International Crisis Group (ICG) has detailed the many missteps by Jonathan's government; essentially its neglect of the development of the Muslim north and also the brutality of its security forces in trying to suppress Boko Haram in the early stages of its evolution when negotiations would probably have borne fruit. The ICG, for instance, fully supports Boko Haram's own call for the prosecution of the police officers who extrajudicially executed the organisation's founding leader, Mohammed Yusuf, in 2009. The report also describes how Jonathan's initiatives, such as they have been, to negotiate a truce with Boko Haram and to bring badly needed development to the north have been frittered away through corruption, ineptitude and scamming. ""Boko Haram"", the report says, ""or groups like it, will continue to destabilise large parts of the country. In other words, the Boko Haram problem is yet another symptom, though certainly a dramatic and ugly one, of Nigeria's prevailing problems of immense corruption and political impotence at the centre. Johnnie Carson, who was US assistant secretary of state for Africa from 2009 to 2013, told the New York Times last week that he had opposed the US's designating Boko Haram as a terrorist organisation, among other reasons, because he feared that it might legitimise a heavy-handed crackdown by Nigerian security forces. Now the US has designated Boko Haram as a terrorist organisation and because of the outrage in abducting the 230 schoolgirls, the US and others are lending muscle to Jonathan's efforts to crush it."804,Cape Times (South Africa),5/14/2014,Minister 'committed' to rooting out corruption|@ 24p pls,E2 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (92%),NEWS; Pg. 3,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,216 words,,14-May-14,,CORRUPTION (92%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); FISHERIES ADMINISTRATION (77%); SMALL BUSINESS (77%); FISHING TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (77%); SHELLFISH FISHING (77%); EXECUTIVES (50%) NotForWeb,"collusion there must be action taken.

Thus, any graft holds back the much-needed transformation of this important sector. Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson has previously expressed her desire to transform fisheries in South Africa. And with good reason: the large commercial companies that benefit from fishing are still largely white-owned, while others are still merely fronted by small, black-owned companies. The trouble is that the minister is dealing with a finite resource - limited fish stocks versus a high demand for quotas. It is a difficult task to be fair so there can be absolutely no space for corruption. Joemat-Pettersson is now determined to get to the bottom of a R445 million deal in which it was reported that R50m worth of fishing quotas - that used to belong to Foodcorp - had been allegedly re-allocated to two companies without due public process. Foodcorp had been hauled to the Competition Commission for allegedly falling foul of requirements of the Marine Living Resources Act. She wants answers by tomorrow and has warned that ""heads would roll if there was even a hint that officials were corrupt"". She will then refer the matter to the Public Protector and the Special Investigating Unit. The allocation of fishing rights is a serious business and Joemat-Pettersson has found herself facing court action by fishing associations because of it. ""In the past I've been criticised for taking action against officials, and where there is collusion there must be action taken. I was not, and will not be, afraid to root out corruption,"" she told the Cape Times. It is not clear whether Joemat-Pettersson will retain her portfolio as a new cabinet configuration will be designed over the next few weeks. But if there is one area where continuity is crucial, it should be the fight against graft. The elimination of corruption needs to be the top objective in fisheries - no matter who the minister is. Those who have the rightful claim to make a living from the sea deserve nothing less."807,Cape Times (South Africa),5/22/2014,Clarke says there is 'no room for corruption' in his Aussie team,E1 Edition,AUSTRALIA (94%); NEW ZEALAND (92%),SPORT; Pg. 14,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,465 words,,22-May-14,"SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA (92%)",CORRUPTION (92%); SPORTS TAMPERING (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CRICKET (90%); ATHLETES (77%); SPORTS FANS (73%); SPORTS GOVERNING BODIES (72%) Sport.Cricket,"SYDNEY: Captain Michael Clarke stressed on Wednesday that no Australian teams he has played with have been involved in corruption, saying it was wrong for all cricketers to be tarred by match-fixing.

This morning, I thought, what if I get a phone call from Addis Ababa and a cracked voice says: ""Tafatchi! I am free. I will come and receive the Golden Pen myself."" It did not happen. A couple of hours ago, Eskinder Nega woke up to the shouting of ""Kotera Kotera Kotera"" from the loudspeakers, mixed with the police banging with their sticks on the walls of corrugated steel. Eskinder then stood, ""Hulet, hulet"", ""two and two"" outside in a long line through the mud. When all 200 inmates in his room were accounted for, the door was locked again behind him. I am here on behalf of a colleague. And even though I am free from that very same prison, I will never be free from the memories, or the sounds. The first screams were always the worst, the frightened sound before the first stroke. Towards the end the abused prisoner was always silent. Six disease-ridden cells around a small yard with inmates coughing blood, overridden with lice, fleas and rats called ""Sheraton"" by the inmates because, even if it was bad, the small dark cells where humans were kept like animals - standing chained in the dark, hanged upside town, and beaten until they confessed their made-up crimes - were worse. The inmates named these cells ""Hilton"". Humour is the last line of defence. But the worst thing with the federal police station, Maekalawi, during this rainy summer month of July 2011, was not the methods, but rather who the Ethiopian government had chosen to put there. In the cell to my right was journalist Wubshet Taye, in the cell in front of me was Reeyot Alemu. The fear of an Arabic Spring had led the Ethiopian regime to act rather than risk being acted upon. Journalists were charged as terrorists and the Arabic Spring turned into an early African Autumn. On the outside, one person stood up for all of us in our cells. One person dared to question the government's ludicrous claim that we, the jailed journalists, were terrorists. One person said that the anti-terrorist law was used as a pretext to detain journalists, and was critical to the government, Eskinder Nega. Five days later, Eskinder Nega was arrested - and later sentenced to 18 years. His criticism of the law got him arrested, for violating the law. It was the sickest of jokes. I see this Golden Pen of his as an honour, not only for enduring more than 1 000 days in jail - but above all for the journalism that led him to Kality. Eskinder Nega and his wife Serkalem Fasil's contribution to bringing new blood into the Ethiopian media industry has been immense over the years. Together they showed what journalism could and should be, but too often isn't. His articles were to the point, provocative, they expanded the public sphere and signalled a new beginning that made it easier to breathe for the readers. The couple's newspapers have been instrumental in the development of journalism in Ethiopia. But he paid a price for the generations to come. The highest price. He paid with his freedom. Looking back at his life we must remember that Eskinder Nega at many points faced a choice. He is intelligent, well educated, he could have chosen an easy life, he could have chosen another profession, but the love for the truth, for his country, for his fellow human beings, and for Ethiopia, made him into a journalist. He stayed. And he continued to write. That decision brought him to the dark cells. Not one time. But nine times. Nine. His stubbornness demonstrates a brand of moral courage that we need now more than ever. And courage is the only thing he is guilty of. In Kality, at this time of the year, at the start of the rainy season it is burning hot in the daytime and freezing cold at night. The rooms are more like barns with concrete floors, and it is so crowded that you have to sleep on your side. Prisoners are packed likes slaves on a slaveship. Once a month an inmate leaves feet first. But thinking back, the most difficult part in Kality was not the diseases or the torture. It was the fear of speaking. It's not the guard towers with machine guns that keep the prison population calm. It is the geography of fear. People who speak politics are taken away. They disappear. This eats its way into your soul. I would wake up at night afraid I had said something negative about the government in my dream. It went under your skin. In such a situation, fearless people like Eskinder Nega help the whole prison population to keep their dignity. By still writing. Protesting. Not giving up. He helped us all maintain our humanity. But there is one thing I know that even Eskinder fears. That is to be forgotten. When you're locked up as a prisoner of conscience, this is the greatest fear and the support from the outside is what keeps you going. This Golden Pen award will not set him free tomorrow, but it will ease his day today. He will go with his head high knowing that he is there for a good cause. That the pain and suffering has a meaning. That he is on the frontline in a fight that has turned global. And in that sense this Golden Pen is more important than food, medicine and water. It materialises the support and shows that he is not forgotten. That he is one of us. That an attack on one journalist is an attack on us all, and that jailing a journalist is a crime against humanity. To take a stand for Eskinder is also to take a stand for all those courageous journalists who should be here with us today in this room. But he is not only a symbol. He is also, and foremost, a human being of flesh and blood. He is a father, with a wife and a now 8-year-old son. To demand his release is also to reunite a family that has suffered more in a mental prison over the years than any one should have to suffer. In a letter smuggled out to his 8-year-old son, Eskinder Nega wrote: ""... The pain is almost physical. But in this plight of our family is embedded hope of a long-suffering people. There is no greater honour. We must bear any pain, travel any distance, climb any mountain, cross any ocean to complete this journey to freedom. Anything less is impoverishment of our soul. ""God bless you, my son. You will always be in my prayers."" When I read these words by Eskinder I know that they will never break him, because he is at peace with himself. He knows that, even though he is chained, robbed of his physical freedom, the freedom to talk or to be silent, the freedom to drink or eat, and even to sh*t. He knows, as do all prisoners of conscience, that you have it in you to keep the most valuable thing, the freedom that nobody can take from you, the freedom to determine who you want to be. Eskinder is a journalist. And every day he wakes up in Kality prison is just another day at the office. A couple of weeks ago the Ethiopian election campaign started with the jailing of nine more journalists. The crackdown was a flashing alarm to the world that no one is safe. That there is a hunting season for journalists in Addis Ababa. But despite this difficult situation there is light. Eskinder Nega's courage has turned out to be contagious; a new generation is stepping up. A generation of young cheetahs have been taking enormous risks writing, tweeting and speaking truth to power, demanding the jailed be released. It is hopeful. It shows that they can jail journalists but they can never succeed in jailing journalism. Words led Eskinder Nega to Kality prison. And in the end it must also be words that set him free. When I see this Golden Pen of his, look back, and think of Eskinder who is left behind in the chaos, on the concrete floor, between walls of corrugated steel, I feel sick to the stomach. But then I remember his smile and his strength and I think that at the end of the day, it's not us that are fighting for his freedom - but rather he who is fighting for ours. Ayzoh Eskinder! Ayzoh!

James Stewart, KPMG's global infrastructure chairman, said at a roundtable discussion on Friday that feedback received from contractors, developers and investors was that the political risk in South Africa had increased. South Africa is ranked 72nd out of 175 countries on Transparency International's 2013 global Corruption Perception Index. It has dropped 34 places since 2001, with half the decline occurring since 2009. However, Stewart said political risk manifested itself in many ways and could simply be politicians changing their minds, which was of great concern if that affected private sector returns. Stewart said international companies were also not going to invest in South Africa unless there was sustainable power supply, while high speed broadband connectivity was important to some investors. ""If businesses are looking to invest in certain knowledge-based businesses, then high speed broadband becomes 'a must' and something they are getting elsewhere. So it will become part of their investment decision,"" he said. Population growth was a big driver of infrastructure development and investment. The population of Africa would double to 2 billion people by 2050, when one in four global workers would be on the continent compared with only one in eight in China, he said. Of the 2 billion people in Africa in 2050, 60 percent would live in cities, which meant 20 million Africans would move to cities every year. Housing was high on the list for investment as a consequence of this population growth, Stewart said, because too many people were already living in slums. Investment in education was important to raise the number of qualified people coming through the system. He believed agriculture and food production would be the next big infrastructure sector, including investments in the logistics chain to efficiently transport food from the fields to the supermarkets and ports. South Africa's National Development Plan (NDP) sat right at the top in terms of the quality of infrastructure plans around the world, particularly because of its cross-sectoral approach. But Stewart admitted implementation and delivery of infrastructure projects were challenges in South Africa and in other countries. There was a discrepancy between the NDP target of investing 10 percent of gross domestic product in infrastructure and the lower percentage allocated to infrastructure in the Budget, he pointed out. The biggest single lesson learnt from infrastructure development globally, he said, was that project delivery would go well if the preparation, including the design and planning, was done correctly. Stewart stressed the importance of the right leadership to drive specific projects and an independent monitoring or review process by experts at the critical points, such as before they went out on tender. ""The great advantage of these independent reviews is that they change behaviour because if you are subject to scrutiny, you get your act together before the scrutiny takes place. ""The value of the review is not in the review but what happens before the review even takes place."" He said KPMG sought to help cities, such as Johannesburg, to make better decisions on their investment priorities. ""If you are more realistic about what your priorities are and pursue [fewer] projects, then you have a much better chance of delivering the smaller number of projects."""811,Cape Times (South Africa),7/7/2014,"Tribalism, |corruption|in Kenya|exposed",E1 Edition,KENYA (96%); SOMALIA (95%); AFRICA (79%); NETHERLANDS (51%),Pg. 9,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,521 words,,8-Jul-14,"NAIROBI, KENYA (58%); THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS (51%)",AL-SHABAAB (92%); TERRORISM (91%); TERRORIST ATTACKS (90%); ELECTIONS (89%); RACISM & XENOPHOBIA (89%); POLITICAL VIOLENCE (89%); ETHNIC CONFLICTS (78%); CORRUPTION (78%); PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (78%); REBELLIONS & INSURGENCIES (78%); ASSASSINATION (77%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (77%); IMMUNITY (77%); COUNTERTERRORISM (76%); INTERNATIONAL LAW (69%); INTELLIGENCE SERVICES (68%); INTERNATIONAL COURTS & TRIBUNALS (66%); INDICTMENTS (65%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (59%); DESTINATIONS & ATTRACTIONS (56%); TOURISM (56%) Opinion,"THE deep, underlying historical flaws of Kenyan society - tribalism and corruption - are being cruelly exposed under the pressure of the growing insurgency by al-Shabaab from neighbouring Somalia. Yesterday the government announced that at least 21 more people had been killed in raids in two separate areas of the coast. This followed the wave of terrorist attacks last month in Mpeketoni, on the north-east coast near the major tourist destination of Lamu Island, which killed about 60 people. The government of President Uhuru Kenyatta is responding to the terrorist attacks with heavy-handed and indiscriminate action against Kenya's large Somali community, and by blaming domestic political opponents. As al-Shabaab steps up its terror campaign - a response to Kenyan military forces invading southern Somalia in 2011 to take on al-Shabaab - the Kenyan security forces seem unable, or perhaps even unwilling, to stop the Somali terrorists. Instead of intelligence-gathering and detective work, the security agents have increasingly resorted to broad spectrum counter-terrorist methods such as rounding up Somalis indiscriminately for rough interrogation, or assassinating clerics. Kenyatta himself is scapegoating his political and tribal opponents. After the Mpeketoni attacks he said his own Kikuyu tribe had been targeted and the ""well-planned, orchestrated and politically motivated ethnic violence"" had been perpetrated by ""local political networks"" rather than al-Shabaab, even though it had claimed responsibility. All Kenyans understood Kenyatta to be referring to the opposition Coalition for Reform and Democracy, led by his old political foe Raila Odinga, whom he defeated in last year's elections. Today Odinga's party is planning to hold a mass rally in central Nairobi to mobilise rising popular discontent against the Kenyatta government's inability to counter the growing al-Shabaab threat - and against its attempts to deflect blame on to others by playing the all-too-familiar tribal card. Memories are still fresh of the tribal and political violence that engulfed parts of the country after the 2007 elections in which Odinga, a Luo, lost to another Kikuyu, Mwai Kibaki, who is widely believed to have rigged his victory. It was because of his alleged role in orchestrating some of that political violence that Kenyatta was indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC), along with his then political opponent, but now his deputy president, William Ruto. Ruto is standing trial at the Hague, but the case against Kenyatta is unravelling, not least because many witnesses have disappeared. Kenyatta has successfully mobilised his fellow African leaders to close ranks with him against the ICC. The AU has tried, so far in vain, to get the case against Kenyatta deferred and to change the ICC rules to grant immunity against prosecution of serving heads of state and government. The AU claimed Kenyatta needed immunity so as not to be distracted from fighting al-Shabaab. Yet Kenyatta is using his free time, now the ICC case is falling apart, not to fight al-Shabaab, but to play his old game of tribal politics."812,Cape Times (South Africa),7/29/2014,ANC refers Gauteng chief whip corruption claims to committee,E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (89%),NEWS; Pg. 4,CT,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,287 words,,30-Jul-14,"JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA (89%)",CORRUPTION (93%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (89%); ASSET FORFEITURE (88%); EVIDENCE (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); BRIBERY (78%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (73%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (73%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (70%); CONTRACT AWARDS (64%) CapeTimes,"JOHANNESBURG: Allegations of corruption involving ANC Gauteng chief whip Brian Hlongwa had been referred to the party's integrity committee, the ruling party in the province said yesterday.

The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) had lodged a series of applications in the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg asking for orders to freeze the assets of certain companies, and a house. The NPA reportedly told the court these assets were the proceeds of a crime. In support of the applications, the Hawks and the Special Investigating Unit submitted thousands of pages of evidence relating to the alleged corruption. Among the allegations was that R300 000 was diverted from the Gauteng Health Department to the ANC's 2009 election campaign in the province. Money was allegedly siphoned off to fund the political ambitions of certain ANC figures. Kekana denied that the ANC had received any money from an official in the health department.

For example, in 2012, Swedish TV4 had exposed the role of newly elected prime minister Stefan Lofven in facilitating payments of R30 million to ANC MPs, he told the Seriti Commission of Inquiry into the arms deal yesterday. Allegations reiterated in the Sunday Times report on September 28 that French arms company Thales's South African subsidiary, Thint, had arranged payments to Jacob Zuma, then-deputy president of the ANC, had highlighted the abuse of state institutions. ""Although it may not have been illegal in 1998/99 in Britain or Germany to bribe foreigners, it has long been illegal in South Africa to receive bribes,"" Crawford-Browne said. The finance minister at the time of the arms deal, Trevor Manuel, should have investigated the alleged bribery and corruption. ""Instead, and in gross abuse of those responsibilities, Mr Manuel actively engaged in cover-up of corruption and fraud associated with the arms deal."" Former British prime minister Tony Blair - ""widely regarded internationally as a war criminal"" - should have been summoned to testify about the bribes and pressure he exerted on behalf of BAE Systems. Crawford-Browne said although he had appealed in 2012 for the inquiry to do this, the commission had deemed it ""premature"" to do so. The opportunity of investigating the role of the British arms manufacturer and the Bank of England ""in the destabilisation of resource-rich Asian and African countries"" had been lost. In the case of Sweden, the money for ANC MPs was allegedly laundered through Swedish trade unions as funding for an industrial training school, Crawford-Browne said. ""Mr Lofven in 1998 was the international officer for the Swedish Chemical Workers Union and the bribes were alleged to be laundered through (the SA National Civic Organisation) and Moses Mayekiso. ""This illustrates the extent of corruption in the international arms trade even in squeaky clean Sweden."" Mayekiso is a former ANC and Cope member who was the Workers and Socialist Party's presidential candidate. He was the inaugural secretary-general of the National Union of Metalworkers of SA and was among the first leaders of Sanco. It was Crawford-Browne's campaign through the courts for an inquiry that led to Zuma's appointing the commission, chaired by Judge Willie Seriti, to probe alleged corruption in the government's acquisition of arms. - Sapa"818,Cape Times (South Africa),10/9/2014,'When Hani was assassinated he was on verge of exposing Modise's corruption',E2 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (79%),NEWS; Pg. 1,CT,Newspaper, Sapa and Staff Writer,ENGLISH,517 words,,10-Oct-14,"PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA (55%)",INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); ASSASSINATION (89%); MURDER (78%); POISONINGS (78%); ESPIONAGE (78%); ARRESTS (78%); BRIBERY (78%); CONSPIRACY (78%); POLITICAL PARTIES (72%); INTELLIGENCE SERVICES (71%); PAROLE (69%); CANCER (67%); SENTENCING (66%); JAIL SENTENCING (64%); CAPITAL PUNISHMENT (53%) CapeTimes,"ARMS deal critic Terry Crawford-Browne yesterday made more startling allegations in his testimony to the Seriti Commission of Inquiry into the arms deal - that when MK chief Chris Hani was assassinated in 1993, he was on the verge of exposing then MK commander Joe Modise's corruption. Crawford-Browne also testified that Modise had been fatally poisoned. The previous day he testified that Winnie Madikizela-Mandela had been behind the leaking of confidential documents on arms deal corruption to the media. Madikizela-Mandela's personal assistant, Zodwa Zwane, told the Cape Times last night that Madikizela-Mandela was not prepared to comment on the allegations as yet. The ANC has rejected Crawford-Browne's claims regarding the former first lady. Crawford-Browne, a retired banker, said he was told by Bheki Jacobs six weeks before Modise died that he (Modise) was being poisoned, and that his death would be ascribed to cancer. Crawford-Browne told the inquiry in Pretoria: ""Mr Modise was known to have many enemies and it is also known there was considerable animosity between him and Mr Chris Hani dating from their times in exile."" Bheki Jacobs, also known as Uranin Vladimir, Hassan Solomon and Hassan Osman, died in 2008 after a six-month battle with cancer. Crawford-Browne said Jacobs was an ANC intelligence operative. In 2003, Jacobs was arrested, and later exonerated, for allegedly plotting an assassination. At the time, Jacobs reportedly believed his one-time comrade and later nemesis, Mo Shaik, to be behind the arrest. ""It has been alleged that Mr Janusz Walus (Hani's assassin) was| ultimately employed by the British arms manufacturer BAE, perhaps by way of John Bredenkamp, the Zimbabwean who was the second-largest recipient of those BAE bribes,"" he told the inquiry. Blaming Clive Derby-Lewis for Hani's murder was merely a red herring to blame white right-wing elements, diverting attention from the British arms industry. Derby-Lewis was convicted of conspiring to kill Hani by providing the gun Polish immigrant Walus used to kill him in the driveway of his home in Boksburg, on the East Rand, on April 10, 1993. The 78-year-old former Conservative Party MP, was initially sentenced to death, which was commuted to life imprisonment when the death penalty was abolished in 1995. He has been repeatedly denied parole. Yesterday Crawford-Browne said Jacobs told him that an investigating team's report was being doctored pending Modise's death ""so that dead men can tell no tales"". On Tuesday, Crawford-Browne singled out ANC stalwart Madikizela-Mandela as one of the ""concerned MPs"" to have leaked documents on the 1999 arms deal. But ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte said: ""The ANC is outraged by reports that Terry Crawford-Browne has named ANC stalwart Comrade Winnie Madikizela Mandela as one of the 'concerned MPs' who leaked to him information about the arms deal.

Criminal charges loom. The person implicated pleads innocence. It's a conspiracy, he claims. He threatens to sue his accusers, but then quietly drops the allegation when his own criminal case conveniently disappears. Sounds topical? Actually it's 1875. The fabulously rich Kimberley diamond fields are still being mined by artisanal means. There are hundreds of claim-holders and thousands of black labourers. But mining is becoming hazardous. The diggings now reach 18m down. With summer rains there's flooding. Retaining walls collapse and production halts for months as mud and debris must be removed. Smaller claim-holders are forced to sell. Syndicates with connections in London are moving in. The brief age of artisanal mining is about to end. In 1875 Cecil Rhodes is still a minor player on the diamond fields. But the previous year he'd won a pumping contract at De Beers mine to clear it of water. But he bungles the lucrative contract. The pump's steam boiler bursts when he forgets to maintain it. There are delays in repairing the pump. Anger mounts among claim-holders with their diggings under water. But Rhodes has contacts. He promises to import new equipment from England and his contract is indefinitely renewed. Meanwhile, the mining board employs a young Mauritian engineer, Huteau, to supervise pumping. He succeeds where Rhodes has failed though he's paid considerably less. Rhodes's future contract looks to be in jeopardy. Then, on December 26, 1875 Huteau's pumping operation mysteriously fails and the mine floods. The royal commissioner, Colonel Crossman, is in town. Under oath, Huteau confesses to being bribed to sabotage his own equipment. Who bribed him? Huteau declines to answer. Under threat of legal action he writes down a name which is handed to the royal commissioner. Reading it, Crossman immediately summons Rhodes. But the gentleman in question can't be found. Two days later Rhodes asks his old Oxford pal, Sidney Sheppard, who happens to be attorney-general, to prosecute Huteau instead for perjury. The unfolding story is masterfully recounted in Martin Meredith's Diamonds, Gold and War. These traditions of primitive accumulation, of corruption among an emerging capitalist stratum live on. Today's tenderpreneurs give new meaning, I guess, to the idea of ""Rhodes scholars"". But what do we mean by ""corruption""? It certainly involves criminal behaviour by politicians and civil servants plundering public resources. But is it only them? In global corruption ratings the US scores considerably better than South Africa, however it's a question of definition. It's now accepted behaviour in the US Congress for committee chairs to ""fund raise"" from companies affected by the work of their committees. ""Today"", Robert McChesney writes, ""that's arguably the whole point of getting to be a committee chair"". Then there's the revolving door. In the 1970s, 3 percent of retiring Congress members became corporate lobbyists in Washington. Today it's over 50 percent. Corporate perversion of politics, McChesney notes, ""is only rarely of the traditional bribery variety. It's instead a far more structural dependence upon corporate money built into the DNA of the political system - traditional pay-offs aren't |necessary"". In South Africa, by contrast, an old economic elite has not yet entirely inserted its DNA into the new political reality. Yes, business in general will condemn corruption, after all it's a cost. But in South Africa, individual businessmen and corporations competing against others still too often find ""traditional pay-offs"" fit for purpose. l Cronin is Deputy Minister for Public Works and deputy general secretary of the SACP."822,Cape Times (South Africa),10/28/2014,"Speak out against greed, corruption",E1 Edition,AFRICA (79%),Pg. 11,CT,Newspaper, Thabo Makgoba,ENGLISH,1784 words,,29-Oct-14,,WEALTHY PEOPLE (72%); STADIUMS & ARENAS (71%); SPORTS & RECREATION (71%); POLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS (68%); CORRUPTION (61%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (59%); TOXIC & HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES (55%) CapeTimes.Opinion,"We have made enormous strides in the past 20 years.

There are huge differences between the development of the wealthy parts of our cities and that nearly everywhere else. We live with massive disparities of income, largely based on race but increasingly based on whether you have made it into the middle class. Black economic empowerment often contributes to inequality rather than closing the gap between rich and poor. We are failing in our efforts to eliminate the desperate conditions in which many of our people live, creating potential for an explosion of anger if we do not move fast. How did we get here? And where do we go from here? First, let us acknowledge that the church has failed to act with the courage that Beyers Naude showed, and to speak out when we have seen our political leaders failing. We have tried to work within our democracy by engaging with its institutions and following paths laid down for consultation and dialogue. That has been the right thing to do - but not at the cost of losing our prophetic voice. We have committed the mistake that Beyers warned us against. We have too often silenced ourselves by practising quiet diplomacy with those in authority, flattered by access to power and ready too quickly to acquiesce when we hear how difficult their task is. In the apartheid era, courage enabled students to ignore bullets and guns and to risk their lives to work for the ideal caring, compassionate society we dreamed of. But courage is fast dissipating in our society, fear seems to be enveloping all of us and if courageous voices don't speak out, there is no one to provide our ruling elite with a moral compass. When our political leaders realised that they could not meet their well-intentioned promises, when they realised the assumptions which they had used to formulate a national vision had changed, they failed to be transparent and honest and to tell us that. Instead of treating us as adults, they began throwing blame around, pointing fingers and perpetuating fear. Fear has become the dominant emotional driver on many of our country's stages. Fear keeps us focused on the past and worried about the future. Fear stifles our thinking and actions. Fear creates indecisiveness that results in stagnation. Every day we see talented people, leaders in all walks of life who procrastinate indefinitely rather than risk failure. Lost opportunities cause erosion of confidence, and the downward spiral begins. We have to bring to an end the failure of white South Africans to speak their minds, because when they keep silent for fear of being branded racists, they fail to contribute to solving our problems. We have to bring to an end the failure of black South Africans to speak their minds, because when they keep quiet for fear that white racists will exploit differences between blacks, they too fail to help solve our problems. Our future lies in our ability to rise above all of this. Haven't we languished down in the trough of despair and fear for too long already? It's been said: ""Only when we are no longer afraid do we begin to live."" The most egregious threat to our democracy today is the insidious cancer of corruption. I cannot say it any more simply than that corruption is anti-democracy. The late Neville Alexander put it this way in a book published last year, where he said that ""our real concerns are the palpable signs of social breakdown all around us: the ever more blatant examples of greed and corruption involving public figures, who are expected to be the role models for youth... the smug dishonesty, indiscipline and slothfulness of those who are paid to render services; the lack of respect for life-preserving rules."" He added, ""in short, the mayhem and apparently suicidal chaos that ordinary people experience in their daily lives."" My Roman Catholic counterpart in Cape Town, Archbishop Stephen Brislin, has pointed out that corruption is not something new in South Africa; it is not something that has emerged only after our liberation. In a contribution to a booklet called Interfaith Reflections on the Fight Against Corruption, he notes that, and I quote, ""the colonial past and our apartheid past were both highly corrupt systems"". He also points out that corruption is not only an issue affecting governments and politics. He writes: ""[T]his is clearly untrue, as corruption can and does affect every level of society - business, corporations, NGOs and indeed churches themselves."" So, while all of must be concerned about corruption, no institution can be holier-than-thou about it. Next, I am really puzzled by what President Jacob Zuma and his lawyers are reported to have argued in representations to the National Prosecuting Authority some years ago. According to City Press, which has seen an NPA analysis dealing with Mr Zuma's reasoning as to why he should not be charged: ""One of the reasons President... Zuma believed criminal charges against him relating to the arms deal should be dropped was because corruption is only a crime in a 'Western paradigm'. And even if it was a crime, [Mr] Zuma's lawyers apparently argued, it was a crime where there are 'no victims'."" If this is the case, we have to ask what values - whether they be cultural, constitutional or faith-based values - the president and his lawyers used to come to that conclusion. Contrast what is reported to be their thinking with the following statement identifying who suffers from corruption: ""[Corruption] means that the state pays a higher price than it should, which takes money away from education or health care for the poor. Or it means the state accepts a poorer quality hospital or road or housing unit, which endangers the welfare of the population and particularly the poorest citizens who so often rely on that hospital or house. It is as simple as that."" That statement was made by Mr Zuma's Minister of Economic Development, Mr Ebrahim Patel, in a contribution to the same booklet as Archbishop Brislin. The title of Mr Patel's article is: ""Fighting Corruption is a Fight For Social Justice."" I couldn't have put it better myself. What can they be talking about if they are saying corruption is a Western paradigm? Presumably, this means cracking down on corruption is somehow a Western phenomenon which is not appropriate in Africa. Actually, I think it's the other way around. Corruption is a two-way street, a two-way transaction. For corruption to happen, you have to have a corrupter, someone willing to pay the bribe, and a ""corruptee"", someone willing to take a bribe. For Africans, over the 50 or 60 years since liberation, the Western paradigm - if indeed there can be said to be one - is one in which Westerners have been the corrupters, and African elites the corruptees. Let's turn away from talk of Western paradigms, and look for an African paradigm. We need go no further than a declaration adopted by Africa's heads of state and government at a summit in Maputo in 2003. Its title is African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption. In the preamble to the convention, the African leaders of government say, and again I quote, that they are ""concerned about the negative effects of corruption and impunity on the political, economic, social and cultural stability of African States and its devastating effects on the economic and social development of the African peoples."" Clearly, they agree with Minister Patel. (As an aside, might I ask our president: Does he?) In Article Three of the convention, signatory states say they will abide by a number of principles, two of which state: l ""Transparency and accountability in the management of public affairs."" l ""Condemnation and rejection of acts of corruption, related offences and impunity."" Corruption is paralysing progress across South Africa today. We all know about the high-profile cases which dominate the headlines, whether they concern Nkandla or provincial departments here in the Eastern Cape. But for every one of those cases, there are many more - I am sure it is thousands across the country - which go unreported. The moral compasses guiding our leaders and public servants are misaligned. We have forgotten the bond between our religion and democracy. We in the churches have been surprised by suggestions from politicians in recent years that we should refrain from commenting on political issues. Leaders of the liberation movements had no problem when the church was involved in politics in the apartheid era. But now that those leaders are in power, some of them are using the same language as the leaders of the apartheid government. I believe that Church and State have a dual responsibility in which we must each play our role, and religion plays a pivotal role in stabilising and strengthening our democracy. But it's not only up to the politicians and the faith community: the whole of society, not least those of you in the educational and academic community, must play our part in bringing about what I have previously called a ""Renaissance of Trust and Responsibility"". As we enter the third decade of our democracy, we must reflect on what we can learn from our country's ""great struggle"" of the last century and ask: Are we not again confronting the reality that we can achieve equality only if we embark on a second ""great struggle"", a ""New Struggle"". The New Struggle requires that you, who in my mind and heart represent millions of honest, hard-working, South Africans, must come together to realise the potential of this blessed country. It takes integrity to acknowledge we can do better, but it takes courage actually to do better. l Archbishop Makgoba is the Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town.

""Suffice to say that all processes have been followed."" Maimane had wanted to know whether the case was being investigated, who the investigating officers were and the timelines for the probe. Nhleko would not give more information. Maimane laid the charges shortly after the release of Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's final report on the Nkandla upgrades.

It was shown a decade ago with a series of successful bribery charges against high-profile international companies working on the gigantic Katse Dam project. But are tough anti-corruption laws dating from that period constitutional? This week they came under the spotlight after prominent politician Mothejoa Metsing challenged their validity in the high court. In the wake of Lesotho's election last month, the foreign editor for Independent Newspapers, Peter Fabricius, described Metsing as a ""notoriously unfaithful coalition partner"". That's putting things mildly. Metsing, who heads the Lesotho Congress for Democracy, has played a crucial role in recent attempts to form a coalition government. Until 2012 he partnered prime minister Pakalitha Mosisili in a coalition government. Then Metsing initiated what turns out to have been a temporary separation rather than a divorce. He and his party walked out of the common home and shacked up with Tom Thabane's All Basotho Convention, thus allowing Thabane to form a coalition. It didn't last long. Late last year Metsing dropped Thabane, the resulting crisis saved from catastrophe only by the efforts of South Africa's deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa. Now, following new elections, Metsing is back with Mosisili, though no-one imagines this is anything other than a temporary home. As he forms his new government, Mosisili will surely be studying a new high court decision following a challenge brought by Metsing against the directorate of corruption and economic offences, the minister of justice, the attorney general and some banks operating in Lesotho. The court heard that towards the end of 2013 the directorate received information about large-scale bribery and corruption. It concerned construction company Big Bravo which, informants claimed, was illegally awarded a road-building tender. According to these allegations Metsing, minister of local government and chieftainship affairs at the time as well as deputy prime minister, received bribes from the company. The directorate launched a ""discreet and confidential investigation"" which showed Metsing had appointed the deputy principal secretary as his delegate on the adjudication panel and that the initial evaluation report had been ""revised to favour the company"". The directorate then contacted Standard, Nedbank and First National banks, explaining that they were conducting an official investigation under the prevention of corruption laws and asking for the statements of Metsing's accounts starting on January 2013. Standard's records showed ""various unattributed cash deposits"" into Metsing's account totalling R328 000. Nedbank's statements reflected ""numerous unattributed cash deposits"" with a total of R118 000. Metsing's FNB platinum account showed similar deposits of virtually R525 000. Last July, the directorate wrote to Metsing that it was conducting an investigation under the corruption laws involving the ministry of local government and senior government officials in Lesotho and asked Metsing, in terms of these laws, to explain the origin of the funds they had highlighted. Metsing responded with court action questioning whether the anti-corruption legislation was constitutional. For example, he claimed that when the law empowered the directorate to approach his banks for information, without first requiring that the banks obtain his consent to hand over the information, it violated his constitutional right to privacy. The court, consisting of three seconded South African high court judges, has now held the legislation constitutionally sound. Though the banks' notices were not issued ""with the necessary attention to detail"" - for example, in some places they quoted the wrong sections of the law - they were still valid. If the legislation infringed his right to privacy this was justified by the legitimate government purpose of investigating and prosecuting corruption. The court said that even if the bank statements were unlawfully obtained, either because the wrong sections were quoted or Metsing's privacy rights were violated, the statements could still be admissible evidence in any future case. Clearly Metsing has convincingly lost this round - but what happens next? Right at the start of its judgment the court stressed the dispute was about the constitutional rights of the parties: the right to a fair trial, the right to silence and the right to privacy. It was not about the facts involved in the investigation or whether Metsing committed corrupt acts. Those issues had to wait for the outcome of the preliminary round before they could be followed up. Now that's been resolved, Metsing will have to reply to the directorate's questions about all those cash deposits. His answers, and the directorate's resulting decision on whether to prosecute, could have far-reaching consequences for politics in Lesotho."838,Cape Times (South Africa),3/23/2015,How an unreliable power supply in Zimbabwe is exacerbated by corruption,E1 Edition,ZIMBABWE (98%),BUSINESS REPORT; Pg. 16,CT,Newspaper," Madalitso Mwando |Bulawayo, Zimbabwe",ENGLISH,806 words,,24-Mar-15,,ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); POWER PLANTS (89%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (89%); BIOFUELS (89%); HYDROELECTRIC POWER (78%); ENTREPRENEURSHIP (78%); HYDROELECTRIC POWER GENERATION (78%); POWER FAILURES (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (77%); MAYORS (77%); BUDGETS (77%); ETHYL ALCOHOL MFG (77%); ELECTRICITY MARKETS (76%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (76%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION (76%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (76%); BIOMASS (76%); ENERGY & UTILITY SECTOR PERFORMANCE (76%); CONTRACTS & BIDS (75%); SOLAR ENERGY (73%); ALCOHOLS (73%); ETHANOL (73%); ENERGY & UTILITY LAW (71%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (70%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (70%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (70%); BRIBERY (70%); CONTRACT AWARDS (68%); SCANDALS (65%); STATE OWNED BUSINESSES (64%) Business.News.International,"JEFFIAS Moyo kick-starts a generator and waits for its reassuring hum to fill the air at a maize grinding mill in Zimbabwe's second-largest city. Operating three mills in one of Bulawayo's many working class townships, Moyo knows all too well the frustrations of trying to run a business without reliable electricity. Frequent power cuts mean resorting to a generator, solar panels and even car batteries to breathe life into machines that strip and pound kernels of corn until they become a fine powder. What should be a thriving business faces unpredictable costs in the country where, like many residents and businessmen, Moyo pays twice for energy - once to the state power authority and again for back-up energy when the electricity fails. ""I bought a generator which I alternate between grinding mills, but I cannot survive,"" he said. ""This thing requires a lot of fuel."" The cuts have no fixed schedule, sometimes lasting for eight hours in a working day, making it nearly impossible for Moyo to budget for the fuel to keep his mills running. The extra costs can cut 25 percent from his profits each month. While Zimbabwe has ambitious plans to expand its power production by 2018, the sector is beset by corruption scandals. Lawmakers have called for energy projects to be cancelled and for high-level arrests over charges of inflated costs. Last month, former energy minister Dzikamai Mavhaire, his deputy Munacho Mutezo and a local investor were|accused in a parliamentary|report of corruption involving an ethanol plant. According the report, Mavhaire received kickbacks from local bio-fuel firm Green Fuel, which was awarded a $2 billion (R24bn) contract for an ethanol project to produce fuel from sugar cane in Chisumbanje, eastern Zimbabwe. Mayor Justice Wadyajena, who chairs a parliamentary committee that has led several probes of energy projects, told parliament in February that Mavhaire ""must be investigated to establish the truth"" on the Green Fuel project. President Robert Mugabe's government has not opened an investigation into the allegations. Green Fuel did not answer e-mails and phone calls requesting comment. Chinese investment Zimbabwe has one of the highest rates of perceived levels of public sector corruption in the world, according to Transparency International. Local media routinely report that state-owned companies are plagued by corruption, including flouting tender procedures to hand contracts to related parties. China, whose support of Mugabe stretches back to the days when it backed his guerrilla war against white-ruled Rhodesia in the 1970s, has won major power contracts without competitive bids, prompting|accusations of corruption by critics. As part of its plans to boost its energy sector, Zimbabwe is expanding its biggest power plant, the Hwange Thermal Power Station in the north-west, and hydroelectric power generated from the Kariba Dam on the Zambezi river to the north. Together these projects by 2018 would add 1 200 megawatts to the current national supply of 1 700 megawatts, enough power to exceed daily demand by more than one third. But costs have soared by more than 25 percent. In the first call for tenders, the Hwange plant was priced at $1.1bn and since has risen to $1.5bn, while costs at Kariba South have ballooned from $355 million to more than $500m. Mugabe declared last December that major national projects would be awarded to Chinese firms without going to tender. The Kariba South and Hwange projects were awarded to China's Sinohydro, financed by China's Exim Bank. In parliament last year, former finance minister Tendai Biti disputed the value of the projects, and said the Chinese were ""fleecing"" the country in cahoots with senior government officials. Mavhaire refused to answer questions about the energy projects. When contacted by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, he said: ""I don't talk to journalists."" Zimbabwe's current Energy Minister Samuel Undenge and Sinohydro officials did not respond to inquiries about parliament's allegations of inflated costs. While former government officials face charges of siphoning millions from public projects, private businessmen are busy pilfering from the grid. ""Everyone I know relying on electricity is doing it,"" said Lungile Sidambe, who runs a small panelbeating and spray painting shop in Bulawayo's Kelvin North light industrial area. They tap main power lines to get free electricity. ""You get all the electricity you want, but it is of course dangerous as you can be electrocuted if you mess up the connections,"" Sidambe said. He and others see little choice if they want to stay in business. The Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries cited prolonged power cuts as one of factors explaining why industrial activity shrank as a share of gross domestic products from 39 percent in 2013 to 36 percent last year. - Reuters"839,Cape Times (South Africa),3/30/2015,R3bn saved in corruption crackdown on social grants,E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (94%),NEWS; Pg. 4,CT,Newspaper, Babalo Ndenze,ENGLISH,382 words,,31-Mar-15,"PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA (73%)",CORRUPTION (90%); CHILDREN (78%); BANKING & FINANCE (77%); EXECUTIVES (73%); APPROVALS (72%) CapeTimes.News,"THE Department of Social Development has saved more than R3 billion and removed almost a million bogus social grant beneficiaries from the system, says Minister Bathabile Dlamini.

Dlamini and officials from Sassa gave details on how the social sector has performed over the past few years to root out fraud and corruption. ""We've saved plus R3 billion and almost 850 000 moved out of the system, and then out of the 850 000 some of the people did not come to re-register, and those were mostly children,"" said Dlamini. She said they did manage, however, to bring some of the child beneficiaries back into the system after verification. Dlamini also hit out at the ""technically legal"" but ""immoral"" debit deductions on the poor, with the entrance of the Sassa card into the banking system. ""I must highlight that while we have made progress in pushing back on blatant fraud and corruption, we are also finding ourselves having to deal with a new frontier of exploitation of the most vulnerable members of our society as a result of the entrance of the Sassa payment card into the open-loop banking system. ""While some of these deductions may be technically legal, they remain immoral as they serve to rob the poor from resources that we as South Africans provide for them to meet their basic needs,"" said Dlamini. She said when they started with the re-registration of beneficiaries process in 2012, they found that in areas around Mthatha, Msinga (KwaZulu-Natal) and the Northern Cape, many cards were returned to the department. ""What shocked us was that people wanted to know what we're going to do as a form of appreciation because they returned cards on their own,"" she said.

Four party sources from Buhari's All Progressives Congress (APC) said the issue of fiscal terms, seen as crucial by the industry, would have to wait on current thinking about oil and gas policies for Africa's leading producer. Crude output has stagnated close to 2 million barrels a day over the past few years, owing partly to underinvestment. ""We need to address the structural issues and leave the fiscal for now,"" said Senator Bukola Saraki, whose APC party controls both houses of parliament after a landslide win. ""A more transparent NNPC (Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation) is needed with reasonable accounting,"" he said. Buhari owes his March 28 victory against incumbent Goodluck Jonathan partly to a perception that Jonathan allowed corruption to get out of control in the oil sector. A string of multibillion-dollar oil corruption scandals tainted the NNPC and other bodies that handle energy. By contrast, Buhari was seen as one of the few Nigerian leaders to have cracked down on corruption during his military rule in 1983-85. Many Nigerians hope he will again. Yet the main thing the oil companies were worried about was tax. Uncertainty over the fiscal terms of the bill have been holding back billions in investment, especially into capital-intensive deepwater offshore. APC sources say the new administration will first sack and replace the top management of the state oil company. Then it will review its accounts to restore credibility. - Reuters"842,Cape Times (South Africa),4/20/2015,General cries over corruption charge,E1 Edition,SOUTH AFRICA (94%),NEWS; Pg. 5,CT,Newspaper, Tania Broughton,ENGLISH,379 words,,21-Apr-15,,INVESTIGATIONS (91%); CORRUPTION (91%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); FORENSICS (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); POLICE FORCES (78%); EVIDENCE (78%); FINANCIAL CRIME COUNTERMEASURES (78%); SPORTS & RECREATION (73%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (70%) CapeTimes.News,"DURBAN: KwaZulu-Natal provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Mmamonnye Ngobeni burst into tears when confronted by police watchdog Ipid investigators about her alleged ""corrupt"" relationship with fraud suspect Thoshan |Panday.

Government critics who refuse to be muzzled can find themselves sacked. Others avoid trouble, such as the broadcaster which screened a documentary on penguins last June while police sprayed thousands of demonstrators in Istanbul with tear gas. What has erupted in the past few weeks - a probe into alleged corruption at the heart of Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's government - might seem like a gift to Turkey's cowed and long-suffering press. But, with a few exceptions, much of the press is in no position to capitalize on the scandal by taking a more robust line with the government. The scandal has blown open a feud between Erdogan and the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, a powerful former ally whose ""Hizmet"" (Service) movement has influence in the police and judiciary, as well as parts of the media, and whom Erdogan blames for orchestrating the graft probe to unseat him. ""Gulenist"" newspapers such as Zaman and Bugun, previously loosely allied to Erdogan's AK Party, have reported details of the allegations, from pictures of cash stuffed in shoe boxes to damaging phone recordings between businessmen and Erdogan's associates, something almost unthinkable just a few months ago. Pro-government newspapers like Sabah, Star and Yeni Safak have largely portrayed the corruption investigations as a plot against Erdogan. In the middle is a mainstream media, largely owned by sprawling conglomerates with business ties to the state, which has been cautiously trying to find a more assertive new voice, although its ownership structures cast doubt over whether there can be real change. ""The graft probe is a new opportunity for Turkish journalism to push itself out of suffocation,"" said Yavuz Baydar, one of Turkey's most prominent journalists who launched Platform 24, a media monitoring website, on Monday. ""The question is whether major, conglomerate-owned outlets such as Hurriyet and Milliyet will be able to rise up to the challenge,"" he told Reuters. Milliyet declined to comment while the editor in chief of Hurriyet did not respond to emailed requests. Baydar lost his job at Sabah, whose former owner Calik Holding is run by Erdogan's son-in-law, after criticizing the police crackdown on anti-government protests last June. Sabah was sold in December to Kalyon, a construction group with major government contracts, in a deal that typifies the ownership structures in Turkey's media landscape. At least a dozen newspapers and 10 TV stations are owned by conglomerates with energy, construction or mining interests, all sectors heavily dependent on government business. ""This has created a situation in which media outlets are used to promote the ownership group's financial interests,"" U.S.-based press watchdog Freedom House said in a report published on Monday. ""Members of the media and the government alike describe newspapers' Ankara bureau chiefs as 'lobbyists' for their companies,"" it said. Erdogan has described the corruption investigation as an attempted ""judicial coup"". He has reassigned prosecutors and judges and thousands of police officers. That has brought the probe to a halt and prompted lawyers, despairing at what they view as a lack of transparent judicial process, to leak court documents to those parts of the press not favorable to the government. But when news website T24 published an article about a parliamentary question from the opposition Republican People's Party regarding claims of bribery in the sale of Sabah and other media assets, it was told to take it down by the media regulator. Then on Monday the same regulator said it had sent the warning by mistake. ""We're just trying to provide something different from the 'government newspapers' that publish the AK Party line that this is a coup d'etat,"" said Erhan Basyurt, Bugun's editor-in-chief. The paper's circulation went up to 165,000 from 140,000 in the month after the corruption probe broke. Other newspapers have had to be more cautious. A senior editor at one of Turkey's largest dailies, who did not want to be named and fears for his job after his boss was told to fire him, said he had been the subject of a hate campaign on the Internet and in pro-government newspapers. He was followed and threatened, his car-license plate at one point published online, he said. Sometimes he did not put bylines on stories to protect reporters. He also might soften the headline or put material damaging to Erdogan lower down in stories. Restrictions on press freedom and attacks on journalists are nothing new in Turkey. Commemorations of the 2007 murder of Armenian-Turkish journalist Hrant Dink, widely viewed as a political assassination, still draw tens of thousands each year. But the taboos have changed. Where once criticism of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the revered founder of the modern secular republic, or portraying Kurdish militants as anything other than ""terrorists"" might have resulted in a jail sentence for ""insulting Turkish identity,"" now it is criticism of the government which is problematic. Editors and reporters said they had received phone calls from officials close to the prime minister asking them to change their coverage or dismiss journalists for critical stories. ""The voice on the end of the line says, 'Beyefendi rahats?z olmas?n,' which can be translated as 'Better not upset sir',"" said prominent author and columnist Ece Temelkuran, fired from the Haberturk newspaper after a series of such warnings for her coverage of a Turkish air strike which killed Kurdish civilians. ""The use of the word 'sir', 'beyefendi' makes your realize straight away what you are dealing with,"" she said. Government and AK Party officials declined to comment. Turkey is the world's leading jailer of journalists, with 40 in prison as of December, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Reporters Without Borders' press freedom index ranks Turkey 154th out of 178. The government says no journalist is being held or tried for their work. ""They are facing situations like these solely because they have got mixed up in other activities,"" a senior government official, who did not want to be names, told Reuters. But government influence, such as the indirect sackings and threat of loss of business for parent companies, which poses the main threat to press freedom, journalists and rights groups say. ""The government seems to have acquired the habit of shooting the messenger whenever it is in trouble. Journalists should not have to suffer because of high-level administrative in-fighting,"" Reporters Without Borders said in a December report. These criticisms come ahead of local elections in March, a presidential race in August and parliamentary polls next year. Opposition candidates complain that Erdogan's frequent speeches are broadcast live and in full by a slew of television stations, a degree of coverage his opponents do not enjoy. ""One of the most pernicious effects of the widespread firings of reporters and editors from the 'mainstream' media is that there are fewer moderate voices to be heard,"" Freedom House said in its report.

Democrat Ron Calderon, 56, has agreed to turn himself in on Monday to face two dozen counts of bribery, fraud, money laundering and other charges, U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte said at a news conference to announce the charges. ""Senator Calderon is accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars in bribes and using the powers of his elected office to enrich himself and his brother Tom, rather than for the benefit of the public he was sworn to serve,"" Birotte said. State senate leader Darrell Steinberg called on Calderon, a veteran legislator and member of a political dynasty going back several decades in California, to resign or take a leave of absence. ""At a minimum, he should take a complete leave of absence until the criminal proceedings are finished,"" Steinberg said. ""If he does not resign, or take that leave of absence voluntarily, the Senate will seek to suspend him."" Phone calls made to Ron Calderon's offices in the Los Angeles area and in Sacramento were not answered on Friday. According to a 28-page indictment handed down in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Thursday, Calderon is accused of taking some $100,000 in cash bribes, along with plane trips, golf outings and jobs for his children, in exchange for influencing legislation. Prosecutors say the lawmaker accepted bribes from Long Beach, California, hospital owner Michael Drobot to preserve a legislative loophole that allowed Drobot to defraud the state's healthcare system out of hundreds of millions of dollars. The senator's brother, Tom Calderon, a former member of the California State Assembly, was also named in the indictment and charged with conspiracy and seven counts of money laundering. Drobot has agreed to plead guilty to separate federal charges and is cooperating in the case against the Calderon brothers, prosecutors say. Ron Calderon is also accused of accepting money from undercover FBI agents who he thought worked for an independent Hollywood movie studio in exchange for supporting an expansion of film tax credits in California. Both Calderons are accused of laundering the bribe money by funneling it through Tom Calderon's consulting firm, Californians for Diversity. Tom Calderon, 59, pleaded not guilty during a brief hearing in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Friday. His defense attorney, Shepard Kopp, said that he ""categorically denies"" the charges against him. ""This is direct payback by the government for Ron Calderon refusing to wear a wire and cooperate with the government's investigation,"" Kopp said. He declined to elaborate. In June, FBI agents raided the Sacramento offices of the senator and the California legislature's Latino Caucus, where he was a member of the executive board. At the time, high-profile Los Angeles attorney Mark Geragos told the Sacramento Bee newspaper that prosecutors had no case against Calderon and should be ""ashamed of themselves"" because, he believed, they had leaked word of the raid to the media. Geragos could not be reached for comment on Friday and his office declined to say if he was still representing Calderon. In November, Calderon was removed from the board of the Latino Caucus and from his legislative committee assignments by his colleagues because of the investigation. If convicted at trial, Ron Calderon, who also faces tax fraud charges, could face a statutory maximum of nearly 400 years in prison, although federal sentencing guidelines typically call for much less time. Tom Calderon could face a maximum of 160 years behind bars.

Recently, the Acting Chief Justice was quoted in the print media to have admitted that corruption was a reality in the judicial system in Zambia which position was supported by the President of the Law Association of Zambia. On July 6, 2014 Father Richard Luonde was quoted in the print media to have stated that there was something amiss in the conduct of some Church marriages where some pastors were bribed to breach accepted Christian procedures in the conduct of Church marriage ceremonies. The Acting Chief Justice as well as the Anglican priest are very senior members of their respective professions who have had the courage and boldness to call a spade a spade. Whatever negative social and economic impact corruption in the judicial system and Christian circles may be having on the Zambian society it is definitely chicken feed when compared to the damage caused to the nation by the rampant existence of corruption in the construction industry and yet no stakeholder has come out in the open to boldly accept this fact and pledge to fight this scourge. Traces of corruption in the construction industry are evident at all levels of the construction process from procurement methods by clients or developers right through to consultants up to the construction stage. These matters have been addressed before under this column. The tendency, for instance, to pretend to procure goods and services through invitations to suppliers of goods and services to register with companies on payment of non-refundable fees has no valid justification other than as a means of easy fundraising and yet this has become an annual event taking place at the beginning of each year. Providers of services in the construction industry are registered members in their respective professional bodies where they pay annual renewal or membership fees and registers are available to anyone in need of such services and it is therefore not necessary to request such members to pay additional registration fees to each and every company that advertises for registration to hopefully do business with them annually. And yet no stake holder in the institute of purchasing or other procurement bodies has condemned this practice. Single sourcing for provision of services in the construction industry has been in use for a long time but no strings were attached to this procurement process until recently. There are certain services which can only be satisfactorily delivered by limited specialists in the construction industry in which case architects and other consultants may nominate a particular contractor or indeed supplier to provide such a service because the consultants, based on past reputation in terms of workmanship, pricing and delivery periods, are confident that the so nominated contractor will deliver the requested services to the satisfaction of all concerned. Single sourcing is still used in procuring services in the construction industry only this time round it is sometimes dressed in sheep's clothing where those in need of services go through all the routines associated with open tender processes to give an impression of transparency meanwhile they have already identified who is ultimately to be awarded the contract, at a fee of course. One sign of such a ""wolf"" process is where the invitation to tender does not include a clause to allow participants to attend and witness the tender opening or the invitation to tender has too many unnecessary qualifications. It is the abuse of the single sourcing process which is used by those in charge of the procuring of goods and services to corruptly raise funds for themselves or even raise ""contributions"" to fund political parties. This may be done by asking the chosen and preferred supplier of goods or services to quote for the services to be provided then add a markup which is later given in cash to those who facilitated the contract award, that way it is difficult to trace these corrupt dealings. And yet no stake holder has openly acknowledged the reality of this practice. Appointment of consultants is sometimes based on technical and financial proposals where a decision is made depending on the financial bottom line. It is then possible, with a little help from a cooperating adjudicator, to submit an unrealistically low financial proposal to provide justification for the award of the contract with no intention at all of sticking to the submitted figures knowing very well that over claims will be made during the process of the project either directly or indirectly through connivance with the contractor/client project representative either through persuasion or appointment made through similar manner. An examination at the end of such executed projects would reveal that the so called lowest bid at tender evaluation stage has ended up with a tender sum much higher than the highest received tender sum at tender evaluation stage. This method of siphoning money out of a construction project may be applied at both consultancy stage and at project execution stage involving either the consultant or the contractor even the client or client's representative may have an active role to play in facilitating this process, all of course at a fee. Turning a blind eye to either defective work or nonobservance of specifications and contract clauses can lead to very significant ""cost savings"" which savings do not accrue to the client but becomes additional profit to the contractor most likely to be shared with the consultant who has suddenly developed technical blindness for a fee. The simplest example is where a contract agreement has included a clause on liquidated and ascertained damages to apply where a contractor delays completion of the project within the agreed contract period and instead of invoking this particular clause the consultant decides to turn a blind eye either by cooking up seemingly valid reasons to justify the extension of the building period or ignores to refer to the clause altogether. And yet consultants and contractors are not openly condemning this practice. A construction project would describe in advance the total scope of works to be executed for the stated tender amount. A possible loop hole is to adjust downwards the initial scope of works without similarly adjusting the tender sum for instance a road construction project may involve construction of the actual road, construction of a pedestrian/cyclist path and construction of, say, stone pitched storm drains. After commencement of construction it may be decided either officially or by deliberate omission to exclude works related to the pedestrian/cyclist path, for instance, but without making a similar adjustment in the tender sum meaning making a payment to the contractor including works he has not executed. This over payment may also come in the form of Contingencies; this is where an amount of money is allowed at tender stage to cover possible unforeseen works emerging during the construction period where if no unforeseen works emerge the amount allowed for contingencies must not be paid to the contractor since he has not executed any works under this item. And yet this practice may have happened on a number of projects and no condemnation has been made from consultants. There are a number of building contract agreements being used on various construction projects some of which have not been tested in courts of law and contain various grey areas even though there are court tested building contracts available on the Zambian building market. There are various clauses that address the issue of how payments for executed works would be made during the construction period and it is important to understand the implications of each of these payment clauses to appreciate potential loopholes that may be available as possible avenues for corrupt practices meant to unfairly relieve the client of his project funds. Most projects proceed to construction stage on the basis of construction tender documents including bills of quantities which comprise a full description of the scope of works to be executed for which a contractor submits the accepted tender sum and parties agree in advance on how this money will be paid as works progress. One method of making progressive payments to the contractor is by evaluating the quantity of builder's works satisfactorily executed based on the agreed pre-contract building rates minus any agreed deductions such as retention funds or advance payments made at the commencement of the project. There is a recent tendency to draw up contract agreements that stipulate payments to be made based on a per centum basis even though tender documents include priced bills of quantities. Such payment clauses may include terms like ""twenty-five per centum of the contract price shall be paid to the contractor upon completion of half of the project"" On the face of it this is a seemingly clear clause but it is, in actual fact, a potential area of abuse because while it is very easy to calculate twenty-five per centum of the contract sum assessing what comprises half of the scope of works may not be that easy. It is this grey area where a contractor may be paid, by connivance, more money than is actually due to him. In short there are potential areas of corruption in the construction industry which have been taken advantage of over the years. Just as the Acting Chief Justice has done as far as the judicial system is concerned, it is equally important that key players in the construction industry must accept, to start with, that there is rampant corruption in the construction industry which is depriving the nation of the much needed resources. Secondly stakeholders must make public measures they plan to take to curb the scourge; meaning the Road Development Agency, The National Council for Construction, the Zambia Institute of Architects, Consulting Engineers of Zambia, Quantity Surveyors of Zambia, Procurement Agencies and Association of Building Contractors in Zambia must accept that corruption is a reality in the construction industry and also outline corrective measures they will individually and collectively take. The Anti Corruption Commission should not adopt a position of waiting in offices for whistle blowers to submit cases of suspected corruption but rather be proactive and engage all stake holders to sensitize them on dangers of allowing corruption to take root in the industry and persuade the councils of these bodies to follow up and conclude cases of corruption or unprofessional conduct reported to them because a number of such cases have been frustrated by the same people entrusted with the responsibility of enforcing professional conduct. It is economically profitable for the nation to prevent corruption rather than prosecute offenders after resources have been squandered."850,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),2/3/2015,CCPC Director Nabbed for Corruption,,ZAMBIA (70%),,,Newspaper,James Kunda,ENGLISH,120 words,,4-Feb-15,"LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (70%)",CORRUPTION (93%); ARRESTS (90%); CONSUMER PROTECTION (88%); CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (88%); CONSUMER LAW (86%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (86%) Zambia; Corruption,"THE Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has arrested Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) director of legal and corporate services Maureen Mwanza, for corrupt practices involving K50, 000.

Corrupt behaviour is wrong, so everyone agrees, because the vice is often integrated in the essential aspects of the economic, social and political system. This is why corruption poses a danger to development as it threatens to sap the nation of economic resources. As a result all people desire to have it wiped off the face of society. When people talk of corruption in Zambia, like many other countries, eyes are often focused on the technocrats and, most importantly, political decision-makers. Corruption emanating from especially the latter - this powerful group of people - is called political corruption and mainly occurs when the laws and regulations are abused, side-stepped, ignored, or even tailored by those in high offices to fit their interests. This is where such things as Government contracts are illegitimately given to private individuals, usually not on merit but precisely because of the connections they have with those awarding them as they try to amass wealth for themselves. One of the end results, as often stated in the Auditor-General's report, is misallocation of resources. There is also what is commonly known as petty corruption, which is bribery in connection with the implementation of existing laws, rules and regulations. Technocrats and just ordinary citizens are mostly involved in this vice. Some people call this 'low level' or 'street level' corruption because modest sums of money are involved. Yet people experience it more or less daily. This form of corruption takes place in people's daily encounter with police at roadblocks, public administrators and service providers at such places as hospitals, schools, and local licensing or levying offices and other places. 'Low level' or 'street level' corruption, therefore, does not take place in posh offices, highways or central business districts of towns and cities. As Action for Transparency (A4T) says, this form of corruption is rife at the grassroots level, yet people who are victims of this vice do not bother to report it, perhaps because they feel it is a normal way of life. It is encouraging, therefore, to note that A4T is carrying out sensitisation activities in communities, beginning with Lusaka, educating people on the importance of reporting corrupt activities of the low-level nature and, surely, the project needs everyone's support, especially women movements whose voice is usually louder and clearer."852,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),3/7/2015,Blow Whistle On Corruption - A4T,,ZAMBIA (94%); SWEDEN (90%),,,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,388 words,,8-Mar-15,"LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (90%)",CORRUPTION (91%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (90%); INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (78%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (77%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (72%); MOBILE & CELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS (71%); MOBILE APPLICATIONS (66%); MOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES (50%) Zambia; Corruption,"ACTION for Transparency Zambia (A4T) has appealed to communities to break the silence on corruption. A4T is a pioneering project that fights corruption and mismanagement of public funds by putting the power to monitor the vice in the hands of citizens through the use of latest technology. The project is funded by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) and managed by Fojo Media Institute at Linnaeus University. A4T coordinator, Andrew Miti said many people, especially at the grassroots, were afraid to report suspected corruption because of fear. He said as part of the activities, the project was carrying out awareness activities in Lusaka communities, educating people on the importance of reporting corruption in their communities. The ground-breaking project is being implemented in the health and education sectors in Lusaka District only but may be rolled out to the rest of the sectors if successful. Mr Miti explained that people could now report suspected corruption in an efficient and anonymous manner by visiting the A4T official website at (www.actionfortransparency.org) or downloading for free the project mobile app. ""By visiting the A4T website, people can know how much has been allocated or spent on their schools and clinics. Equipped with this knowledge, they can question or even report suspected mismanagement of public funds or corruption by using a mobile phone. ""The report will then be published on our website, facebook or even on the Transparency International website. Prosecution authorities such as the ACC may even take action,"" Mr Miti said. The project is being implemented by the Zambia Institute of Mass Communication Educational Trust ZAMCOM in collaboration with the Anti-corruption Commission (ACC) and Transparency International Zambia (TIZ). The project has already conducted sensitisation activities in Linda, Mandevu and Kabanana townships, and more would follow in other townships, and the feedback from members of the public was overwhelming. Mr Miti said it had come to the attention of project officials during the awareness drives that many cases of corruption were going unreported in the communities because of fear. ""This is why are equipping community members with knowledge on how to track resources allocated to clinics and schools within their communities,"" Mr Miti said."853,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),3/13/2015,Dj Convicted for Corruption,,ZAMBIA (92%),,,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,256 words,,15-Mar-15,,CORRUPTION (92%); MAGISTRATES (90%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (90%); CITY GOVERNMENT (78%); BRIBERY (77%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (76%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (73%); CITIES (70%) Zambia; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"THE Livingstone Magistrate's Court has convicted a Disc Jockey (DJ) and journalist working for Zambezi FM radio station in Livingstone for engaging in corrupt practices.

Details are that between November 1, 2012 and December 31, 2012 in Livingstone, Anakene corruptly offered K4,000 to Vivian Chikoti, a town clerk then at the Livingstone City Council as an inducement for her to allocate him a piece of Land in Livingstone. When the matter came up for judgment in Livingstone yesterday, Livingstone Resident Magistrate Chinkashi Chilingala said he found the accused guilty as charged and convicted him accordingly. He said Anakene had been convicted because he acted in a corrupt manner when he offered K4,000 to a public officer, Ms Chikoti, for a plot he never applied for. Mr Chilingala said it was also overwhelming to note that the accused had not applied for a plot when he offered K4,000 and that there was no logic for the accused to seek acceptance of the money for a service that was not provided.

It costs government billions of shillings every year, through loss of revenue and revolving funds that could have been spent on delivering services. We are told that Kenya has lost an estimated Sh4 trillion to corruption since 2000. This is almost four times our current national budget and it is clear that this is money that can help us achieve the much needed development in the country. Where resources are scarce, corruption is a demonic vice threatening to tear apart our nation's economic fabric and must be exorcised from a multi-level approach through civic education, improved legal framework and strengthening of both public and private sector institutions. It seems grand corruption has become so entrenched in the Kenyan mindset that it should be declared a clear and present danger and a national disaster. No ethnic formation, interest group, religious order or geographical locale appears exempt. From Mombasa to Busia, Kisumu to Tana River, Mandera to Taita Taveta, Turkana to Kisii and all counties in between, there is a common narrative that is all-too-familiar. The press is awash with stories of government officials, constitutional office holders, former civil servants and the now infamous 'tender-preneurs' locked in a feeding frenzy to line personal pockets. It has become a national pastime to clean out the public purse through direct cash withdrawals, solicitations, unreceipted allowances, nepotism, inflating bills through a network of cronies and old school networks. Local and foreign courts are being treated to bizarre tales of brazen looting and high-level bribery, now termed euphemistically as ""chicken sharing"". Few and far between are such narratives as that of the late Nelson Mandela and recently, that of the 'world's poorest President Jose Mujica' retiring this week. Theirs was a humbling example to all humanity as they lived as an example to all of us who are already in leadership positions, or even those aspiring to ascend to public office. Their simplicity, respect for their subjects and family values will be sorely missed. That they were never caught with hand firmly in the public till speaks volumes about being servant leaders. Hereabouts, however, all election cycles mirror one another as all candidates pledge to fight for, and uphold national unity, promise hope and change. All political manifestos express and profess abhorrence to graft and preach a unifying agenda, all the while, vilifying the existing establishment. But once aboard the gravy train, all pretensions are cast to the four winds. No empty public space is left for its true purpose and grabbing has become endemic. Foreign trips have become the norm rather than the exception consuming taxpayer funds that would be better utilized in fighting widespread poverty, equipping hospitals with equipment and sorely-needed medicine, paying county staff, building and equipping schools, paying bursaries to needy pupils, developing roads, rail and energy infrastructure, as well as creating job opportunities to thousands of unemployed youths. Shamelessly, many public officials parade batteries of legal teams whenever various taskforce reports, peoples' watchdogs, Parliamentary committees, and annual Auditor General exposí©s expose them. Reports of billions of shillings stashed in foreign bank accounts have made us laughing stock every time we go around the world with begging bowl in hand. Not even students have been spared as we have seen incidents of exam cheating, most probably with the collusion of teachers and education sector officials. Even getting into public entities such as the police force and the military is highly ridden with corruption. These officers then spend most of their time trying to get back their money instead of serving Kenyans. The government has laid out strategies to curb this vicious and lethal practice through key constitutional bodies like Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and the directorate of Criminal Investigations. However, there is also overriding need to develop sustainable Anti-Corruption Strategy that tries to deal with corruption in a holistic way including coming up with a toll-free anti-corruption hotline where incidents of corruption can be reported anonymously. We also need comprehensive financial audits with true reflections of the actual and strengthening investigating units to root out corruption in the pubic sector. There must be follow up and actionable mechanisms that can be used to deal with issues arising from these audits. Who will hold the moral high ground and shine the torch of shame on the dark recesses our public officers crawl through? Who among us will be the role models our gullible youth sorely need in their formative years? How punitive should our laws be in criminalising grand corruption? Even the voice of reason that should be religious leaders is tainted with leaders who preach water and gulp down the proverbial wine. Where did the rain start beating us, and where shall we find veritable public servants? It is a participatory national and collective course all Kenyans must spearhead for posterity. Corruption will continue to kill our economy if we continue to let it become a norm in Kenya, and all must work to ensure that it is eradicated.

Strangely though, we seem to be blind to the fact that corruption is a major threat facing us all. Corruption destroys lives and communities, and undermines countries and institutions. It generates popular anger that threatens to further destabilise societies and exacerbate violent conflicts. Corruption translates into human suffering, with poor families being extorted for bribes to see doctors or to get access to basic services. It derails the building of essential infrastructure, as corrupt leaders skim funds. Corruption amounts to a dirty tax, and the poor and most vulnerable are its primary victims. Corruption stinks and we don't care, in fact we love the smell of it. We like to see who will come out richer, bolder, and more brazen from their corrupt dealings. In fact we tend to find a new level of respect for people who are corrupt. We consider them daring, ballsy. Of course, many of us simply roll our eyes and say ""hiyo si shida yangu"". We think that corruption is a personal sin. Something the person accused needs to deal with himself. My fellow Kenyans - Corruption is a personal act that has social consequences. It is theft - fuelled by greed for wealth and power. It can lead to murder when the corrupt try to silence those who try to denounce them or in order to perpetuate themselves in power. Corruption is not only a personal act - a personal sin - it's a social sin. The minute we try to hold a corrupt individual to account, he or she instantly points fingers at everyone else, entangles as many people in this sin of theft, so much so that in the end the watching public walk away saying ""si yeye peke yake. Why pick on him?"" ""Everybody is doing it. I might as well do it."" This has become our justification. Corruption has become a way of life - something considered normal. How you noticed how the church doesn't comment on corruption anymore? It would be awkward. Knowingly or unknowingly, some members of the clergy and religious class have become beneficiaries through donations coming from those engaged in corruption. But this I know to be true - it is a grave matter, a big sin and the punishment is awful. The corrupt however are careful not to let you see how terribly they pay for their ill-gotten gains. I live in the hope that one day, in my lifetime, I will see someone go to jail and do time for corruption. It hasn't happened and it must happen. There must task us to write a new ending to the story of corruption. Currently, all our corruption stories end with the line: ""and he lived, fabulously, comfortably, honourably, ever after"". I want to see the day it ends with - ""he served 20 years in jail for his corruption.'"857,The Star (Nairobi),3/16/2015,Three Kisumu MMCAs Claim Lives in Danger After Corruption Claims,,KENYA (79%),,,Newspaper,Maurice Alal,ENGLISH,278 words,,16-Mar-15,,PETITIONS (91%); CORRUPTION (90%); AUDITS (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); INFORMATION SECURITY & PRIVACY (77%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (77%); HEALTH CARE (73%); BUDGETS (73%); POLITICAL PARTIES (72%); FORENSICS (70%); TREASURY DEPARTMENTS (68%) Kenya; Corruption,"Three Kisumu MCAs who signed a petition accusing Governor Jack Ranguma of graft have claimed that their lives are in danger. The leaders said they have received threats since the petition alleging corruption and mismanagement of county affairs was filed. They are Aggrey Ogosi (Seme East), Joseph Osano (Chemelil) and Elijah Omondi (Nyakach Central). The three declined to name colleagues who have allegedly been harassing them. They however told the Star on Monday that they will record statements with the police. Osano said they have been playing the oversight role since the Assembly ""went to bed"" with the Executive and stopped performing. The MCAs lined up 16 grounds of corruption and abuse of office, which they want authorities to investigate. They want the Auditor General to carry out a forensic audit of Kisumu's fiscal management. They also want the Commission on Revenue Allocation and the Controller of Budget to cease further disbursement of funds to Kisumu until the audit is completed. Their petition further claimed that the county's healthcare system has collapsed due to poor funding. Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital was allocated Sh396 million in the 2013-14 financial year, but only received Sh72 million from the county treasury, they said. Majority leader Samuel Ongow however asked the assembly to discuss the conduct of the three MCAs, saying they used privileged information in the petition. Ongow demanded to know how the MCAs secured confidential information and other important documents in the sole custody of the clerk. He said the clerk should also be investigated, prompting Interim Speaker Samuel Ombogo to order the probe."858,The Star (Nairobi),3/18/2015,"Kenyans Abet Corruption, Says Uasin Gishu MCA",,KENYA (91%),,,Newspaper,Cynthia Koech,ENGLISH,81 words,,18-Mar-15,,CORRUPTION (91%); BRIBERY (90%); POLITICAL PARTIES (88%) Kenya; Corruption; Governance,"Uasin Gishu county assembly majority leader Josphat Lowoi has urged Kenyans to join the fight against corruption.

This comes amid claims from within the EACC itself of the pocketing of Kenya's single biggest bribe ever - a staggering Sh2.6 billion. The verdict from the Ombudsman, coupled with a petition sent to the National Assembly against the agency last week, could see top EACC officials prematurely sent home and even charged with corruption. Yesterday, the Chairman of the Commission on Administrative Justice (the Omudsman), Otiende Amolo, confirmed that investigations into the alleged sleaze are being finalised. ""However, I will not comment on the substance of the allegations. Our investigators work independently of the commission,"" he told the Star. The complaint drafted last year and copied to key institutions, including the Director of Public Prosecutions office, alleges mega sleaze by top EACC officials and dubious out-of-court settlements for kickbacks. The petition, allegedly anonymously drafted by an EACC staffer, claims that Chairman Mumo Matemu is ""asleep"" and too worried by a suit challenging his suitability for the top job. ""The managers and commissioners of the institution are no different from the robbers who raid graves to recover coffins for sale,"" the petition, dated May last year, reads in part. Part of the accusations against Mubea, who was recently suspended over ""integrity issues"", is the settling of an out of court agreement with Mombasa tycoon Rashid Sajjad after a protracted legal duel over landholdings. In March last year, Sajjad handed back 18 title deeds of public plots acquired irregularly, including recreational parks and a clinic. Ironically, inquiries by the Star indicate that the recent acrimonious falling out within the EACC stemmed from a decision to charge businessman Deepak Kamani for an Anglo Leasing-related offence when the secretariat had opened negotiations with the suspect to have an out-of-court settlement. EACC Spokesman Yassin Amaro confirmed that they received the petition and that the Amolo-led commission took over investigations. ""We cannot investigate ourselves. That is why the matter was taken over by the Ombudsman and CID,"" he stated."860,The Star (Nairobi),3/21/2015,The West Must Speak Up Against Corruption,,KENYA (99%); UNITED STATES (95%); SWITZERLAND (92%); UNITED KINGDOM (92%); CANADA (79%); NORTH AMERICA (79%); AFRICA (79%); NORDIC COUNTRIES (78%); GERMANY (69%),,,Newspaper,Kazungu Katana,ENGLISH,1062 words,,25-Mar-15,"NAIROBI, KENYA (90%)","CORRUPTION (97%); EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (90%); BRIBERY (89%); DIPLOMATIC SERVICES (78%); LEGISLATION (72%) Kenya; Corruption; United States, Canada and Africa","Last week, three Western embassies based in Nairobi issued a joint statement on corruption in Kenya. In it, the governments of the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Switzerland welcomed efforts by the Director of Public Prosecutions to order prosecutions linked to the Anglo Leasing scandal. They noted that subsequent arrests of the suspects were important steps in the fight against corruption. Although couched in diplomatic language, the message in the statement was clear - it is time the Government of Kenya took a decisive action against corruption. As expected, cynics have made references to the statement as interference in Kenya's internal affairs, notwithstanding the fact that official corruption in this country is real. What the countries of the West are doing in calling for government action against corruption in this country is merely lending support to the homegrown anti-corruption crusade that has been fighting against the vice since the infamous Goldenberg scandal in the 1980s. This indigenous anti-graft crusade is again urging the government to act against the Anglo Leasing and the ChickenGate scandals. Coupled with bribery and corruption claims within our lawmaking body, the National Assembly, the situation has been aggravated. There is cause for alarm and the time for government action is now. Public support from Western governments on critical issues affecting Kenyans is not new. Morally and materially, these governments through their embassies in Nairobi supported the pro-democracy movement in the 1980s and early 1990s. The US, especially, as well as Germany, Britain and the Scandinavian countries were at the forefront in this support. Reports that some elements within the National Assembly may have been involved in bribery and corruption make the situation even worse. This is why the time for government action is now, if not yesterday. However, curbing corruption should not be left to indigenous crusaders alone. There are limitations to what individuals and civil society in this country can appeal for government action. First, Kenyan civil society, unlike in the 1980s and 1990s, has been rather timid in the fight against corruption, partly because of the uncertainty surrounding the future of a viable civil society in this country. The Jubilee government has not been friendly with civil society in the light of proposed legislation meant to curtail their activities. Secondly, ethnic support has been a hindrance against corruption. Individuals and entities suspected of corruption have sought and got the support from their communities in the Kenyan politics of watu wetu wanamalizwa (our people are being finished.) This is why just like the pro-democracy movement that was supported by external sources against a recalcitrant government, local anti-graft crusaders, without support from external sources, are unlikely on their own to win the war against corruption. This is also why public diplomacy is needed to speak directly to the Kenyan people. By applying people-to-people diplomacy, Western diplomats in Nairobi are telling Kenyans they support them in their aspirations to end official corruption. It is an issue the Kenyan government should know through government-to-government diplomatic channels. The evils of corruption are known. Corruption destabilises economies leading to, among other things, lack of service delivery and unemployment, especially among the youths. Corruption also destabilises the economies of friendly countries. Part of the reason Kenyans form long queues in Western embassies seeking travel documents is not just about student, business or tourist visas; many of these Kenyans are forced to seek employment opportunities abroad and corruption has been a contributory factor. The billions of shillings illegally acquired and stacked in foreign bank accounts could easily propel the local economy, boosting industry, production and creating employment opportunities for the thousands of Kenyans. For those Kenyans who have been unlucky to travel to the Middle East in search of job opportunities, their fate has been sealed - some of them have come back home in caskets. To be sure, corruption is not the preserve of Kenya. It is certainly a global phenomenon. It transcends borders. There is corruption even in those countries that have criticised us - U.S., Britain, Germany, Japan and in the Scandinavian. The difference is the way Kenya has dealt with the vice. In the U.S. and Britain, for example, corruption cases are swiftly and promptly dealt with, irrespective of class or social ranks of the people or entities involved. Recent examples include the Enron scandal in the United States some few years back, and the ChickenGate scandal in the United Kingdom. In Kenya, only the weak face corruption charges; the strong survive. There has not been any notable conviction of the big fish in Kenya in all cases involving corruption. This is what separates Kenya from the West and other friendly countries on matters dealing with corruption. On the Anglo Leasing scandal, the government of Switzerland has shown it is ready and willing to assist Kenya with evidence to prosecute. The ball is now in the hands of Kenyan authorities to act. The result so far has been chaos as evidenced in the split within the anti-corruption body. If the Western donor countries are serious about supporting Kenyans in the fight to end corruption, they must use the carrot and the stick -- just as these countries did when they supported the prop-democracy movement. For example, if push comes to shove, they can deny visas to corruption suspects from visiting their countries either for official or private business until they are cleared by the local courts. Britain did exactly that in the case of former Cabinet Minister Murungaru. It can be done again. On the other hand, the West should consider providing moral and material support to individuals and groups that have contributed to the anti-graft campaign. With this support, civil society groups, including the church and other faith-based organisations, can organise civic education programmes and seminars to sensitise Kenyans on the evils wrought by corruption in the society and the economy. And talking about external support against official corruption -- where are the Chinese? We miss their official anti-corruption stand too."861,The Star (Nairobi),3/23/2015,Senegal Jails Ex-President's Son for Six Years for Corruption,,"SENEGAL (99%); VIRGIN ISLANDS, BRITISH (79%); WESTERN AFRICA (79%); AFRICA (79%)",,,Newspaper,Jill Namatsi,ENGLISH,417 words,,25-Mar-15,"DAKAR, SENEGAL (58%)",JAIL SENTENCING (90%); PRISONS (90%); SENTENCING (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (90%); VERDICTS (90%); ELECTIONS (89%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (89%); CORRECTIONS (89%); HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS (89%); LAWYERS (78%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (78%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (78%); POLITICS (78%); CRIMINAL FINES (78%); LITIGATION (78%); BOYCOTTS (73%); POLITICAL PARTIES (73%); POLICE FORCES (73%); REFERENDUMS (72%); POLITICAL CANDIDATES (72%); APPROVALS (69%) Senegal; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"A special court in Senegal sentenced the son of former president Abdoulaye Wade on Monday to six years in prison for corruption and ordered him to pay a 138 billion CFA franc ($228 million, Sh21 bn) fine, dashing his hopes of competing in elections due in 2017. Karim Wade, in detention since April 2013, was chosen by the main opposition party, the Senegalese Democratic Party (SDP), as its presidential candidate on Saturday, raising the stakes ahead of the verdict. He denies any wrongdoing. ""The crime of illicit enrichment being proven, Karim Wade: six years in prison and a fine of 138 billion CFA francs,"" judge Henri Gregoire Diop said in the ruling, adding that Wade had hidden away funds in offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands and Panama. Opposition supporters inside the courtroom protested loudly after the verdict. ""I no longer want to be Senegalese,"" shouted one woman. ""This verdict is shameful."" Karim, 46, did not attend the final session of the trial and his father Abdoulaye Wade left without making any comment to the media. Karim and his lawyers have boycotted the end of the trial after accusing judge Diop of bias, something he strongly denies. The streets of Dakar were calm immediately after the trial amid a heavy police presence to counter possible protests. Karim, who staged a four-day hunger strike in January to protest over the conditions of his detention, has repeatedly said he is the victim of a political witch hunt, something the government strongly denies. The government has said the trial signals the end of impunity for corruption in Senegal, long regarded as a bulwark of democracy in a turbulent region. ""This is a historic decision not only for Senegal but also for the whole of Africa and all those who defend responsibility, citizenship and good governance,"" said Simon Ndiaye, one of the state's lawyers. President Macky Sall, who ended Abdoulaye Wade's 12-year rule in a hotly contested election in 2012, said last week his government would not tolerate any attempt to destabilise the West African country following the court ruling. Prosecutors had demanded a seven-year prison term and a 250 million CFA franc ($413,784, Sh38 million) fine for Karim Wade, who was known as the 'minister for heaven and earth' during his father's government as he controlled several key ministries. The next presidential election could come as early as 2017 if Sall wins approval in a referendum due next year on reducing the presidential term to five years from seven."862,The Star (Nairobi),3/23/2015,"Raila Should Shut Up Over Corruption, Says DP Ruto",,KENYA (79%),,,Newspaper,Mathews Ndanyi and Sonu Tanu,ENGLISH,605 words,,25-Mar-15,,CORRUPTION (93%); SCANDALS (90%); ETHICS (78%); ELECTIONS (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); POLITICS (78%); PRIME MINISTERS (78%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (78%); HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS (78%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (77%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (77%); POLITICAL CANDIDATES (73%); FUNDRAISING (71%) Kenya; Corruption; Governance,"DEPUTY President William Ruto has asked the opposition to ""shut up"" about corruption, saying Jubilee is sorting out scandals started when Cord leader Raila Odinga was in government. Ruto said the Anglo Leasing scandal, the setting up of key institutions, including the IEBC and the EACC, were started when Raila and his team were either in the Narc government or the grand coalition regime. Raila was a Minister in the Narc government and Prime Minister in the grand coalition headed by President Mwai Kibaki. ""We are cleaning up their mess. They should shut up. They were there when Anglo Leasing started, they there were there when the IEBC and the Ethics commission of Mumo Matemu were set up,"" said Ruto. He said some of the worst corruption allegations were being made in the Public Accounts Committee team in Parliament headed by the opposition. ""They should start searching their souls before they start pointing fingers at us. They should join us in fighting the corruption cancer in our country,"" he said. Ruto said Cord has no moral authority to lecture the government on corruption. He was speaking during a fundraising at AIC Missionary Church at Kapsoya, Eldoret. Ruto defended the government and said there would be no interference in the ongoing investigations into corruption and everyone must be ready to carry their own cross when caught engaging in graft. ""There are no more telephone calls and no 'orders from above'. Everyone must be accountable for what they do,"" said Ruto. The DP said the constitution was clear and the President should not be blamed over graft cases. He said the government made its position on management of public resources and the constitution-mandated independent institutions to fight graft in the country clear. ""We have deployed sufficient resources and support to all institutions of governance, including the office of the Auditor General and the EACC, so that they run independently,"" said Ruto. He said the executive was clear on ensuring that those who run government institutions must be held to account. ""As public servants and as individuals they will be held to account on all decisions, including procurement and other matters involving public resources,"" said Ruto. Meanwhile, Ruto on Saturday told presidential hopefuls that the Presidency was not vacant, and cautioned them against premature campaigns. He told those eying the presidency in 2017 to hold their horses since he and President Uhuru Kenyatta are equal to the task and will proceed to retain both positions since they have the voters' goodwill. Ruto told Kalenjin leaders who were elected in the 2013 general election to concentrate their energies on developing their region and stop politicking at the expense of much-needed services to citizens. He said it is too early for a section of Kalenjin elected leaders to start declaring their presidential candidature as if there were a leadership vacuum in the ruling Jubilee Alliance Party. ""President Uhuru and I are here to stay and, come the 2017 general election, will defend our positions and win with a margin that one would never thought of,"" Ruto said in Kapkatet Grounds, Kericho county. After Uhuru's final term of office in 2022, Ruto told the gathering, he will succeed him as the Fifth President of Kenya, through a popular vote across the country. ""Jubilee sio serikali ya nusu mkate, mimi na Rais Uhuru tuko mamlakani kwa mapenzi ya Mwenyeenzi Mungu na walio tupigia kura (the Jubilee government is no half-loaf coalition government, President Uhuru and I are in power by the grace of God and were democratically elected by the majority of Kenyans),"" Ruto declared."863,The Star (Nairobi),3/24/2015,"I Will Not Shut Up On Corruption, Raila Tells Ruto",,KENYA (95%); AFRICA (73%),,,Newspaper,Felix Olick,ENGLISH,346 words,,25-Mar-15,,CORRUPTION (92%); SCANDALS (90%); PRIME MINISTERS (90%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (90%); RELIGION (76%); ETHICS (73%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (68%) Kenya; Corruption; Governance,"CORD chief Raila Odinga has told off Deputy President William Ruto over corruption, saying his statements on graft disgust, anger and disappoint the people of Kenya.

""I would urge the Deputy President to stop further platitudes and statements on corruption"". Raila was responding to Ruto's criticism over the weekend that the government is sorting out scandals started when the Cord captain was Prime Minister. ""We are cleaning up their mess. They should shut up. They were there when Anglo Leasing started, they there were there when the IEBC and the Ethics commission of Mumo Matemu were set up,"" Ruto had stated. But in his response, the former Prime Minister said that Kenya's global reputation on graft had drastically declined on Jubilee's watch, adding the regime has failed catastrophically in dealing with corruption. Raila said that only two years into the UhuRuto administration, Kenyans no longer believe the President and Deputy President. Raila maintained that the two were ""only barking from a distance"" without taking any decisive action on runaway theft. ""As Archbishop Wabukala of the Anglican Church announced last week, corruption has become a national disaster. The Jubilee government has overseen the most precipitous decline in Kenya's reputation where corruption is concerned among its own people and the international community as well,"" he stated. Raila said that recent international corruption indices indicate that Kenya has overtaken countries long associated with the vice in Africa. ""Worse still, the ever-increasing number and scale of scandals indicate a level of impunity that is unprecedented in our history,"" he said.

""I also want to caution that this should not be an open-ended process, justice must be expeditious, as justice delayed is justice denied,"" he said. Uhuru said that he has attached the confidential report from commission's CEO Mumo Matemu to his annual report on Values to Parliament. He said it is Matemu's view that the institution is under siege because of the nature of the cases it is investigating. Uhuru noted that investigations into the Anglo Leasing scandal have borne fruit. In-fighting and finger-pointing in the EACC are however likely to cripple investigations and overturn the course of justice, he said. ""I strongly believe that this is a further attempt to subvert the successful prosecution of the Anglo Leasing cases,"" he said. ""I have asked the Attorney General to liaise with the Council on Administration of Justice to focus on coordination within the justice, law and order sector. The Council must ensure the efficient and speedy processing of corruption-related cases, including hearing such cases on a daily basis.""

It is instead being used to fight and fix opponents and supposed enemies of the Jubilee regime,"" the statement from ODM's director of communication Philip Etale says. ODM has raised objection to the report by the EACC saying that the body secretly submitted a list of alleged corruption suspects to the President who then proceeded to forward the ""limited copies available"" only to the two speakers who are both from the Jubilee Coalition. ""As law abiding leaders, we know that EACC is supposed to arraign suspects in court, not report them secretly to the President, a member of the Executive who should have nothing to do with the EACC in the stipulated separation of powers,"" the party said. ODM accused the EACC of working with Uhuru secretly. ""The Presidency is itself a leading suspect in the massive corruption scandals muzzling the nation.

So much is going on in the Ministry of Devolution particularly at the NYS and the Ministry of Health where tenders go to the best of friends and highest bidders, yet the president is playing favourites,"" ODM said. The party did not produce evidence of the alleged corruption NYS and Ministry of Health. ODM further hit out on Uhuru saying that he has not spoken about what it termed the increased tribalisation of the nation where appointments are based on tribe, not ability. The party also raised objection on whether the EACC can be trusted in the fight against corruption. ""We are talking about the same EACC that is at war with itself, where juniors have demanded the sacking of their boss, the chairman Mumo Matemu. That demand was equally delivered to the wrong person, the President who should by law keep EACC affair and whom the EACC should demonstrably be independent of.

MPs Gonzi Rai(Kinango), Peter Shehe(Ganze), Ibrahim Sane (Garsen) and the Kwale women representative Zainab Chidzuga expressed similar sentiments saying they fully supported the President's directive that those involved in graft step aside to be investigated."869,The Star (Nairobi),3/27/2015,Uhuru Told to Emulate Rwanda President on Corruption Fight,,RWANDA (94%); KENYA (92%); CHINA (79%),,,Newspaper,Eric Oloo,ENGLISH,214 words,,27-Mar-15,,CORRUPTION (95%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); ETHICS (73%) Kenya; Rwanda; Corruption,"NOMINATED MP Oburu Oginga has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to emulate Rwanda President Paul Kagame in the fight against corruption.

Since independence, serious war against corruption has never been declared. Instead, government leaders and families have used graft to get rich. The only convincing declaration of war against corruption was made yesterday by President Uhuru in his State of the Nation address to Parliament. ""Today I draw the line. No one will stand between Kenyans and what is right with the fight against corruption and other monstrous economic crimes."" Will President Uhuru keep his solemn promise to fight corruption or was his speech just another public relations stunt? I give him the benefit of doubt and support him. In fighting corruption, however, there are hurdles President Uhuru must overcome. To begin with, President Uhuru must spare no one that is found guilty of graft. In drawing the line between the clean and the corrupt, President Uhuru must realise that the most difficult friends and perpetrators of corruption might come from his personal friends, political allies and even members of his family. To take his war to those who are close but corrupt, President Uhuru will need to commit class and family suicide, unless of course, his family, friends and allies agree to support his war against graft. But before Uhuru takes the war against graft to his corrupt friends and allies, he must also be ready to open himself up for scrutiny by fair and just Kenyans - whether he is himself corrupt or beneficiary of direct or indirect, old or new corruption. While the best fighters against corruption will be the poor victims of corruption, who will have the will and the reason to fight corruption, some beneficiaries of corruption through inheritance, like Fidel Castro of Cuba, could renounce inherited benefits of corruption and fight it. When people in power intellectually and ideologically turn against corruption, they fight graft with an advantage of having not just the will and reason, but also power. One can only now hope that in fighting corruption, President Uhuru will have the courage to renounce any inherited benefits of old corruption he may enjoy. This will make him a stronger and more dependable crusader against graft. In declaring his war against corruption, President Uhuru did well to announce that his war against corruption will have no sacred cows and will spare no one who is suspected of graft, quite a shift from putting suspicion at par with innocence. At this point, it pays to remind President Uhuru that the war against corruption is not just action but also the right impression. Uhuru's war against graft will lack public confidence if his vanguard does not look right to people who will support the war and want it won by people who will not sabotage it later, the way independence was sabotaged by wrong people who seemed to be fighting for Uhuru but were fighting for self-interest. President Uhuru must have the cleanest possible team to fight graft. In his last two years in power, President Uhuru seems to have been a victim of political and ethnic alliances that put him in power but also took away from him courage to send home suspects of graft for fear of offending either his own or other side of Jubilee political-cum-ethnic alliance. Now that he has a political outfit - JAP - that is not based on an obviously ethnic alliance, he must have the guns to stick to his demand that suspects of graft must step aside until investigations against them prove them innocent. So, as President promised, the country wants to see all those who are mentioned in the report annexed to his speech step aside with haste. Only that will prove that the president has turned a new leaf in his war against graft. Mr President, your war against corruption must avoid pitfalls of targeting and only fighting new graft while forgetting old corruption. While old graft may not stink as much as new, it must not be spared or it will be proof that if one hides long enough, his corruption may never be punished. Fortunately for President Uhuru, the war against graft will not be that difficult. If courts of law play their part as they should, there is enough evidence to ensure we keep corruption killed and buried forever. Accordingly, President's team on corruption should revisit reports of the Controller and Auditor General to ensure no corruption escapes prosecution. However, in his State of the Nation statement, the President forgot to focus on negative ethnicity as one of the key national problems that must be solved to win the war against corruption and propel the country forward. I want to believe that failure to mention negative ethnicity was not deliberate but an omission that will soon enjoy remedy, or else we shall soon begin to hear suspects calling to their communities to protect them against targeting, discrimination and witch-hunting. Finally, let me remind President Uhuru that his war against corruption, while noble and most welcome, it will not be won without restoration of Chapter Six of the constitution to its central place in our governance. Leaders without integrity cannot be relied upon to fight and end corruption."871,The Star (Nairobi),3/28/2015,Thumbs Up Mr President for Your Resolve in the Fight Against Corruption [opinion],,KENYA (99%),,,Newspaper,Machel Waikenda,ENGLISH,488 words,,28-Mar-15,,CORRUPTION (91%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (77%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (77%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (77%); ETHICS (72%); BUDGETS (72%) Kenya; Corruption; Governance,"""In view of the oath of office that I took as the President of this republic, let it be known that today I draw the line. No one will stand between Kenyans and what is right in the fight against corruption and other monstrous economic crimes."" - President Uhuru Kenyatta. This statement made on March 26, 2015, will forever be edged in the history of Kenya as it turned a new chapter in its resolve to have a better Kenya. It is a day that saw a Kenyan President applauded through a standing ovation as he addressed a special joint sitting of Parliament. President Uhuru summarised the country's key challenges as corruption, disunity and insecurity. He also outlined how his government plans to deal with this and gave directives to the executive. The President took an extraordinary step of suspending his own officials including Cabinet Secretaries for being implicated in corruption. Many had asked the President to stop talking and walk the talk and he did exactly that when we did not expect it. We have asked for action from the Presidency for long, and it is now clear that the President listens and has been listening. The President ordered a speedy investigation and resolution of the said allegations. The step taken by the President deserves accolades from all patriotic Kenyans who are tired of seeing the public coffers being robbed left, right and centre. It is a turning point for the country which has lost more than Sh2 trillion to corruption over the last decade. This, lest we forget, is more than our annual budget as a country, and more than can do wonders for the country. Corruption has over the years denied Kenyans key development and services as a few individuals sort to benefit themselves from public funds. The President also threw a challenge to other arms of government, as they are not immune to the vice, to follow his steps. We therefore, as Kenyans, expect heads to roll in the other arms of government with no delay. All Kenyans and especially leaders must take the President's cue and move with speed to deal with this vice and help curtail the dangers posed by it. Parliament must also, as requested by the President, look at the legislation meant to deal with corruption including the working of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. Another key highlight of the President's State of the Nation address was the apology he made on his behalf, his government's behalf and past administrations for historical injustices. The President deserves a pat on the back for this, and it is not surprising that he got a standing ovation from MPs for this too. He demonstrated the country was on the right path of development with a vibrant economy, growing infrastructure and improved services. The President deserves our support and dedication. All this development he outlined will not be possible unless we all fight corruption, disunity and insecurity.

Our past, that which we have continuously denied or discreetly swept under the carpet has caught up with us; and it is ugly, very ugly. At least two Parliamentary committees charged with over-sighting corruption, namely the Public Accounts Committee and Agriculture Committee, are themselves facing allegations of corruption. As if that is not enough, allegations of corruption have been made against our Independent Elections and Boundaries Commission, our Judicial Service Commission, Kenya National Examinations Council and, incredibly, our Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. Which way Kenya now that the National institutions created to monitor, check, eradicate and prosecute corruption are now themselves mired in graft? That they engage in the very sins that they have been mandated to eradicate is a sickening indictment as to the state of our nation. The existence of corruption in our country is no secret. Bodies like Transparency International have issued warnings regarding corruption in Kenya for decades. Indeed their index, now accepted as the international objective indicator, rated Kenya at a score of 27 out of a possible 100 on the CPI for 2013. Compared to Botswana, the best performing in Africa at 64, Cape Verde at 58, Rwanda and Seychelles at a joint 54, Kenya had flunked the test miserably. Corruption can be broadly broken down into three main categories: (a) Incidental or small-scale involving junior public officials like policemen, immigration or customs officials. It is also referred to as petty as it has little macro-economic cost. It, however, produces deep public alienation and is difficult to curb. (b) Systematic corruption which may affect whole government departments or quasi-government institutions. This may have a substantial effect on state revenue(s) and may divert trade and development thereby affecting economic growth. (c) Systemic corruption which is kleptocracy or theft by the government. In this set-up, honesty becomes irrational. One does not have to be a rocket scientist to infer that corruption has steadily grown from incidental to systemic as our legislature and executive connive and conspire to loot public funds as in the current saga facing PAC. The Speaker of the National Assembly in an attempt to save face has appointed the Powers and Privileges' Committee to investigate allegations of corruption within Parliamentary committees. Apart from being too little too late, our MPs are known to protect and defend one another hence the need for an independent investigation. Our Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission as currently constituted, does not fit the bill as it too is embroiled in internal wrangles involving allegations of malpractice and corruption. We, therefore, welcome the proposal from the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya and the Law Society of Kenya to set up an independent investigation. Civil society and the leader of the opposition coalition Cord have issued ultimatums and all manner of threats to President Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta to address official corruption or face all manner of consequences. If experience is anything to go by, this particular modus operandi was not a good idea. No President since independence has ever responded to threats or ultimatums. That aside, it is also inherently dishonest in that the imperial Presidency was removed upon promulgation of the 2010 constitution, which created specific independent statutory bodies to address corruption and other maladies. It is to these institutions that civil society and the opposition should be addressing their concerns. In event of their failure to respond or act, then there are specific constitutional provisions they should activate resulting in their removal or dissolution. Convoluting and distorting facts is in itself a form of corruption. The incident that triggered the suspension of PAC allegedly involving Defence Permanent Secretary Mutea Iringo, and investigated by Ababu Namwamba amongst others, actually took place during the term of the grand coalition government in which Raila Odinga was Prime Minister. Anglo Leasing contracts took place during the first term of Retired President Mwai Kibaki. Attempts to link these incidents to the current Jubilee government are not only far-fetched but nonsensical and hypocritical.

He spoke to Star reporter on corruption, elective politics, land and ethnicity. I feel pained as a Kenyan and as a crusader against corruption. The source of my pain is that the country is squandering her opportunity in realising her dreams as set out in the Vision 2030. We are squandering the opportunity not only for this generation but generations to come. History is replete with countries destroyed because of corruption. In Latin America before the people liberated themselves from chains of corruption, the state had been captured by individuals who wanted to make money and saw state institutions as a hunting ground where they made money for personal benefits and the State suffered for a long time. In the recent past in Africa there have been countries that have been consumed by corruption for example Uganda in the reigns of Idi Amin Dada, kleptocracies such as Mabuto Sesseko in Zaire (DRC), Central African Republic in the days of Bokasa there is no shortage of country to mention where corruption has eaten and destroyed. Corruption undermines democracy and particularly when it enters into electoral process and we know in this country it has entered in electoral process. It has enveloped every sector in the economy indeed you will remember in the run up to the struggle to a new constitutional dispensation we put premium on a constitutional dispensation that will create a hostile environment to practice of corruption and this was anchored in Chapter six that deals with integrity and leadership, but unfortunately the Chapter was watered down. The other thing that must worry us is that we the people took the view that devolution of political power and certain elements of economic governance will be migrated to the devolved units unfortunately what we seeing is devolution of corruption. We hear about corruption in the county assemblies, as well in the executive arms. We can see a sudden opulence of individuals serving in these institutions. Unfortunately Kenyans are not enraged because of the high social acceptance of corruption. As a early as 1960s the late Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere said that Kenya is a man eat man society, we didn't believe him. The late Josiah Mwangi Kariuki said we risk being a country of ten million beggars we didn't believe him either. Then we created an environment where civil servants started trading with government and we corrupted our political process and created individuals who had wealth. These individuals became political leaders and society accepted and embraced them and we have never looked back. We drank from the poison chalice of ethnicity and we are now paying the price because our cup of inequity is full and is overflowing. All of us. When Kenya goes under and I pray it doesn't nobody will be safe. That's why we can't afford the luxury of apportioning blame; our house is on fire let's not ask who started the fire. Let's all take buckets and bring the water and put out the fire we will deal with the arsonists when the fire is put out. First PAC members have themselves come out saying some within their ranks are engaged in activities that constitute graft. We even have the recording by the committee chair Ababu Namwamba where individuals acknowledge that they received some money. In other civilised jurisdictions that recording only should make people take political responsibility by saying that having been mentioned I cease to serve in this committee unless proved otherwise. Unfortunately that is not happening. Apart from PAC, the Agriculture Committee and Lands Committee have also been accused of graft. The reason is very simple when the watchman is accused of colluding with thieves the watchman no longer has the credibility and one hopes that action will be taken for the good of Kenya. On EACC it is a body with a clear mandate of educating the masses and coming up with modalities to prevent graft and recommending of prosecution of individuals engaged in corruption. The commission forms part of chain in the criminal justice system and it must play its role. I am never worried when EACC is attacked and criticised from outside. It is a norm world over-in South Africa the Scorpions were disbanded because they recommended prosecution of high ranking government officials, In Nigeria the head of Anti-Corruption Enforcement Agency Nuhu Ribadu was threatened with death and had to go to exile. To be fought by external forces is normal, but what should never happen are the internal wrangles as mandarins will use it to destroy and the body. I hope going forward EACC will learn to solve their problems internally, and be more united so as they can focus more on real issues in the fight against corruption. However I reject the Kenyans view that it is the duty of EACC to stop graft it is a duty of all Kenyans you can't tell a pathologist to stop death. You cannot tell doctor to prevent an illness. Their duty is to educate. In relation to the President's executive order to fight graft, this is not the first time we have heard the president lamenting about corruption in his government. But he seems helpless; to an extent Kenyans doubt his resolve and commitment in the fight against corruption. Do you believe action will be taken? I want to be charitable to Kenyatta, and give him the benefit of doubt. Never in the history of Independent Kenya has a president issued an order of this nature. This is the first order issued by a sitting president targeting issues of Ethics and Integrity in the public service. That is why I hold the view that this is the first step in the right direction. Now beyond this what Kenyans are waiting for is action that will give meaning to the order, and we should give the president a few more weeks. In the document there certain things that he has asked to be done in a time frame that will be running out at the end of the month. We can only begin to question or access the seriousness in which the President takes this particular document upon elapse of the dateline. Remember this is a continuous war I hope the President will take this opportunity as well recruit warriors ready to give their lives in the fight against corruption. There are individuals who I know and known to the President prepared to be in the forefront against corruption. It is under my watch that we started tackling individuals in high office, for the first time in the history of Independent Kenya we recommended prosecution of cabinet ministers and started investigating individuals in high ranking offices. Apparently that was the mistake that we made the political class of the day used the occasion to Amend the law and we were disbanded. What I learned corruption is so deeply seated in this country and it is protected by vested interests and one of the most dangerous things is that these individuals are prepared to kill and maim. The other thing that I realised is that ethnicity is a major problem because immediately an individual is recommended for prosecution people from their ethnic group say they are being 'finished.' I remember one day when we were probing a cabinet minister within ten minutes all members of Parliament from his ethnic group were in my office saying that we were unfairly targeting their tribes mate, similar sentiments were shared by the political party he was affiliated to. My response was quite clear that the corrupt belong to their own corrupt world and should be looked at as such. EACC can only do so much in terms of education, prevention and prosecution When we were making the constitution we were very clear in our mind that public land will be vested in the National Land Commission (NLC) because it will be a professional body that is not subject to political machinations. There is need for clarity that the mandate of NLC is to be the custodian of all public land. That the ministry will only provide policy guidance so once the roles are distinguished in that way, I am sure there will be no conflicts. Currently everybody is competing for territory even though law has to be clear as it was intended. Land is the last colonial question and the make or break issues if we don't deal with it well. If not handled well we will be inviting more conflicts and undermining investor confidence because land is a major a factor of production. It is a potential area of danger and left unchecked can destroy the country as it breeds impunity. First of all I believe that KSL is only school that trains advocates to join the legal profession we have about 14 law schools now and with strained resources. Now we have 1800 young men being trained to be advocate it is not easy you can see every often we are accused of disobeying court orders which is untrue what we are trying to do is to ensure that certain standards are met. We receiving graduates not only from Kenya but from the region and even UK and US but we are working closely with the Counsel of Legal Education which is the regulator that tells us this is the university whose students upon qualification can be admitted to law school but of course in every institution there are challenges and those will always be there. It is a major problem that has arisen because expansion of universities and number of students graduating with law degrees. In the olden days only University of Nairobi offered law and admitted not more than 85 students today we have over 14 universities offering the same course and at the same time admitting about 1000 students, who all end up here, and seek for pupillage from few law firms. It has been the practice that in order to take students in for pupillage one must be an advocate who has practiced for more than five years, must have space and a library, this has been limiting in some way in terms of number of placements. But going forward we are working on recognising more placement centres. I have established in my office a placement department to help students in securing pupillage places and I am happy during this year we did liaise with LSK secretariat and sent out the names of all those they can pick. We have been talking with Secretary Counsel of Legal Education with a view of reviewing the curriculum because the one we running now is seven years old. As we speak I have constituted a committee to look at the manner in which we deliver the curriculum to report to me by April 9. It is important to know that under miscellaneous amendments undertaken by Parliament last year in December, it is now true that in order to join the school from January next year, every applicant will be subjected to a mandatory pre-entry examination and that is law now. With the Council of Legal Education we have put together a committee headed by Jacob Kagere to come out with modalities on when and how those exams will be administered and look at what are the implications. It is a good thing to instill merit. The pre-bar exams give the institution an opportunity to access the suitability of the candidates. It is not unique to Kenya, Japan, UK and our own neighbors in the region are doing it. You can take it to the bank once my four years term end, I will never renew it. I have taken the view that once taken the baton and served you will have made the contribution it's only wise to give others a chance."878,The Star (Nairobi),3/31/2015,"Sexual Violence is Also a Form of Corruption, Activists Tell Uhuru",,KENYA (95%),,,Newspaper,Lydia Matata,ENGLISH,307 words,,1-Apr-15,"NAIROBI, KENYA (90%)",SEX OFFENSES (92%); CORRUPTION (90%); SEXUAL ASSAULT (90%); WOMEN (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (79%); MARRIAGE (65%) Kenya; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Activists under the banner Okoa Dada Kenya on Tuesday marched from Freedom Corner in Nairobi to Parliament Building calling on the government to deal with the rise in sexual violence in the country.

The group said that men need to understand that rape is not provoked whether a woman is drunk, unconscious or by the way she dresses stating that ""only rapists are responsible for rape,"" ""We need to create a society where a woman can walk safely at night without the fear of being raped , we need a society that respects woman , a society that does not tolerate violence against women, a society that respects and understands that when a woman says no it means no .

Ababu said in a letter to National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi on Tuesday that the move is in line with his support for the anti-graft war. He noted that members of the suspended PAC have been mentioned in the EACC graft report for allegedly receiving a Sh1.5 million bribe to expunge Defense PS Mutea Iringo from it. ""I do this well aware that I have not been named as an individual but I consider the probe of PAC members to be a probe into the integrity of all 26 of us,"" he said.

He further asked to be excused from any activities of the PAC and participating in any other business of the House and its committees.

President Uhuru Kenyatta's directive for the officials to step aside should not be politicised, several leaders said. Minority leader Francis Nyenze said five MPs had to step aside due to ""mere speculation"". ""Nobody from Ukambani is left. Ngilu is gone, Nduva, Mutua, Muthama and now you want to remove Matemu,"" Nyenze said. He blamed the media for creating aspersions against MPs, saying some facing sexual assault and corruption allegations have been leading ""honourable lives."" Nyenze said that he was happy with Othaya MP Mary Wambui's statement on alleged sexual harassment by some male MPs. Wambui said on Monday that female MPs are partly to blame for as they entertain men who are not their husbands late into the night/ ""If you are a married person, you cannot stay with a man until midnight and say that you are being raped,"" Nyenze said. Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire opposed Nyenze's remark saying he cannot set moral standards for women whether single or married. ""That is why we say My Dress My Choice, My Body My Choice,"" Mbarire said. Mbita MP Millie Adhiambo said Uhuru did not slay ""the dragon of corruption"" in his directive, adding that there is no legal framework for stepping aside. ""He has not touched the dragon on its head and its eggs. The President has just poked the dragon with a needle, but the head and the eggs are still intact,"" Millie said. ""I have been told my name appears due to allegations against the Agriculture Committee. Me, step aside? From where to where."" Officials named in the report should have been dealt with before they were appointed to their positions, Millie noted. She also objected Nyenze's statement saying ""it is obvious"" that the protection of women's rights lacks seriousness. Giving IEBC chairman Isaack Hassan as an example, Homa Bay women's rep Gladys Wanga said according to the court of public opinion, some officials under investigation should have been named. Wanga noted that land grabbing matters, especially those involving school properties, were not mentioned in the report. She further said Parliament should deal with the matter of the EACC ""so that we are not dealing with an EACC facing a credibility crisis"". Cherengani MP Wesley Korir said investigations should have been done before the list was released. Kieni MP Kanini Kega lauded Uhuru for the directive saying corruption cannot be tolerated. Majority leader Aden Duale who table Uhuru's State of the Nation address lauded him for apologising to all Kenyans for past injustices. Duale said that the apology set the stage for national healing and national reconciliation, noting that US President Barrack Obama is visiting in acknowledgment of change. He further denied that the government doctored the report stating that even ""perceived friends of Jublilee"" had been mentioned. ""There is no where to hide, the dye has been cast,"" he said, underling that it is time to separate to remove corruption from the political class."882,The Star (Nairobi),3/31/2015,KAA Suspends MD Lucy Mbugua Again Over Corruption Claims,,KENYA (90%),,,Newspaper,Eugene Okumu,ENGLISH,218 words,,31-Mar-15,,MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); LITIGATION (90%); CIVIL AVIATION (88%); APPOINTMENTS (88%); MISCONDUCT (87%); SUITS & CLAIMS (86%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (78%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (77%); ETHICS (75%); AIRPORT OPERATION (75%); PORT AUTHORITIES (74%); AIRPORTS (70%) Kenya; Corruption,"KAA has revoked Lucy Mbugua's reinstatement as MD following a directive for all public officers implicated in graft to step aside for a probe.

It is those with ""skeletons in their closets"" who were the first to protest Uhuru's approach, said the Presidency's senior messaging director Eric Ng'eno. Ng'eno claimed Raila's ""discomfort"" has its roots in the ""enormous scandals"" his office faced in the past administration. ""The Kazi Kwa Vijana and maize scandals are just two of these colossal frauds on the people of Kenya. Discrediting the anti-corruption process is therefore at the heart of his short, medium and long-term personal interest,"" he said. ""In the Grand Coalition government, Mr Odinga was big on stepping aside as a remedy for perceived integrity lapses in government. All of a sudden, he sees the process as cruel and a joke."" In a statement to newsrooms on Monday, he said Raila's ""tantrums"" indicate a leader ""whose strategy and ideology on corruption have been overtaken by time"". Ng'eno underlined that the anti-graft war is strong, systematic and large scale, saying the EACC's corruption report was duly submitted to Uhuru and Parliament. He accused Raila of lacking meaningful grounds for opposing the approach, adding that he is standing against the people of Kenya and has ""lost it"". Ng'eno said Uhuru's apology for past offenses against Kenyans, ""some of which Mr Odinga is intimately associated with"", was well received by the public. ""The 1982 attempted coup and 2007 post-election violence are some of the matters to which closure will never happen without Mr Odinga standing before the nation and explaining himself,"" he noted. Ng'eno was responding to Raila's view that the public officials on the 'list of shame' should have been fired, not suspended. Raila said on Monday that Uhuru acted as a whistle blower, not an Executive authority, and accused him of breaching the Constitution by handing the report to Parliament. ""By failing to sack those he has the power to sack while admonishing those he has no powers over, the war on graft has once again been cheapened and turned into a game of musical chairs,"" he said."886,The Star (Nairobi),3/31/2015,"Clean House Before Tackling Corruption, EACC Told",,KENYA (90%),,,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,159 words,,31-Mar-15,,CORRUPTION (91%) Kenya; Corruption; Governance,"EACC commissioners should resolve their differences and unite before implicating others in corruption, an MP has said.

The President said there was no turning back on the anti-graft drive which he has started and the fight will address all aspects of the vice. He said corruption was not a 'one-way street' and where there is a corrupt public official there must be a corrupt private sector member. ""Corruption is a two-way street. I have given directives to the Attorney General to amend our laws so that those who pay bribes are also targeted, prosecuted and jailed. The law should reflect that the giver is as guilty as the taker,"" he said. The President said companies that are proven to have given a bribe will be blacklisted and will never participate in Government tendering processes. President Kenyatta said the amendment will also include provisions that will allow the prosecutor to freeze the account of corruption suspects so that the corrupt do not use their ill-gotten wealth to obstruct justice. ""If found guilty, a suspect's assets will be seized to recover what was stolen from the public,"" President Kenyatta said. The President spoke at State House during the 4th Presidential Roundtable that brings together the Executive and the Kenya Private Sector Alliance (Kepsa). The Head of State said besides the 'reality of corruption', there was the 'perception of justice' and there were companies that engage in practices that create perceptions of corruption to defeat genuine competition. Such companies include those who use courts to sabotage tendering processes where they have lost through a fair process. ""If you lodge a case in court and it is proved that you filed the case just to sabotage your competitor, you will be blacklisted and you will never participate in any tendering process in Kenya,"" said the President.

""Investors love destinations that are corruption-free because they are assured that their money will compete in a fair environment,"" he said. On the agenda of the Presidential Roundtable were issues ranging from taxation on raw materials to how the private sector was benefitting from bilateral agreements Kenya has entered into since President Kenyatta came into office.

She said graft has compromised the country's security such that terrorists can move freely in the cities with the knowledge of a few individuals ""whose wallets have been lined up with blood money"". ""Narc Kenya is deeply saddened by the massacre of defenseless and innocent students at the Garissa University by blood thirsty terrorists.

The land is located in Likoni and is currently valued at Sh9.3 billion. Ngilu initially stated that squatters on the land would be issued with title deeds, but later said they would have to buy the land if they wanted to live on it.

The CS was suspended by President Uhuru Kenyatta along with five other Cabinet Secretaries to pave way for investigations over graft allegations. They were named in the EACC's list of shame. Ngilu is being investigated over allegations that she intended to get a Sh65 million kickback from the inflation of land owned by Evason Waitiki in Mombasa county by Sh110 million. ""The CS allegedly instructed the valuers from her ministry to overvalue the land,"" the report says. It indicates that the remaining Sh45 million was to be shared by other interested parties in the transaction.

The Chief Lands Registrar and two staffers of the Director of Surveys - Julius Kitur and Albert Kitur - are also implicated in the scheme. Registrar Mwendwa, her deputy Geoffrey Birundi, senior deputy director of survey Pauline Gitimu and registrar of titles Mark Wanderi are also accused of being among the beneficiaries of the 134.4 acres of land in Karen belonging to Muchanga Investment. EACC has also been investigating the ownership of the 134.4 acres Karen land being claimed by Muchanga and a company associated with former National Social Security Fund managing trustee Jos Konzolo.

Speaking separately to the Star on the phone yesterday, MPs Oyugi Magwanga (Kasipul) and Timothy Bosire (Kitutu Masaba) accused Uhuru of double speech in his efforts to fight corruption. They wondered why the President ordered that 10,000 police recruits whose recruitment was stopped by the High Court over corruption report for training. Magwanga said Uhuru is not serious about fighting corruption and ""he should let those who stepped aside over corruption resume their duties."" ""The police recruitment of the group the President is directing to go for training was marred by massive corruption and it is immoral for him to disregard the court order that stopped the process,"" he said. In October last year, the High Court nullified the police recruitment and barred the National Police Service Commission from issuing the recruits with appointment letters. Magwanga said the judiciary must remain independent without any interference from the executive. ""The court's directive must remain so until a clean process of recruitment is conducted,"" he said. Bosire accused the President of ""rearing contradictions"" in his government and promoting anarchy. ""It is unfortunate that on the one hand, this system claims to thrive on the rule of law while on the other, it thrives on dictatorship,"" he said. Bosire said the President should have asked the judiciary to hasten the police recruitment matter so new recruits are picked in the correct way. ""Otherwise his [Uhuru's] directive manifests a leader who is incompetent,"" he said. The legislator said Uhuru should have sat down with his team of advisers on security matters to come up with a better position. Bosire also said the country's leadership only acts in times of crisis. He lashed out at the government for criticising travel advisories issued by the UK instead of acting on them. Uhuru last Thursday said he takes full responsibility for his directive that the recruits report for training. He gave the directive after al Shabaab militants attacked Garissa University College, killing 147 students. Uhuru said Kenya badly needs additional officers and he would not keep the nation waiting any longer. ""I also assure the nation that my government has undertaken appropriate deployment to the affected area. I urge Kenyans to stay calm as we resolve this matter, and to provide the authorities with any information they may have in connection with any threats to our security,"" he said."902,The Star (Nairobi),4/9/2015,MP Neto Hits At Governor Awiti Over Corruption Allegations,,KENYA (79%),,,Newspaper,Robert Omollo,ENGLISH,312 words,,9-Apr-15,,COUNTY GOVERNMENT (91%); COUNTIES (91%); CORRUPTION (90%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%); NEW CONSTRUCTION (89%); ROAD & BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); HIGHWAY FUNDING (78%); CONSTRUCTION (78%); HIGHWAYS & STREETS (78%); MISAPPROPRIATION (76%); SOLAR ENERGY (71%) Kenya; Corruption; Governance,"Homa Bay county Governor Cyprian Awiti should not blame anyone over the alleged loss of Sh112.5million meant for the construction of roads in the county. Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, Ndhiwa MP Agostino Neto challenged Awiti to tell Homa Bay residents the projects that gobbled up Sh8 billion money his administration received from the national government over a period of two years for the installation of solar-powered street lights. ""The residents are only aware of the recently installed solar powered street lights in Homa Bay town. There is no tangible project the Governor undertook using that colossal amount of money. He should tell us how he spent it,"" said Neto. The MP said the county government has been receiving funds from the national government and the county but the economic impact of the funds is minimal. He said he is not branding the county government corrupt but it should show how tax payers money was used. ""We want to see the development projects undertaken in the two years the county government has been in existence,"" he said. The legislator said residents are suffering because of poor state of health facilities, impassable roads and inadequate provision of clean water. He challenged MCAs to be keen in exercising their oversight role to avoid loss of funds. ""MCAs should be more vigilant when approving county government projects to avoid misappropriations,"" he said. Two weeks ago, county assembly committee tabled a report alleging that Sh112.5 million set aside for road construction in the county had been misappropriated. However, Governor Awiti denied any loss money. He assured residents the money will be refunded through an insurance company. Awiti said the contractor had stopped continuing with the work on Gendia-Kadongo road in Kabondo Kasipul constituency because the contractor went abroad to hire more powerful machines."903,The Star (Nairobi),4/10/2015,"Orengo, Kambi and Nduva Muli At EACC for Corruption Probe",,KENYA (94%),,,Newspaper,Nancy Agutu,ENGLISH,178 words,,10-Apr-15,"NAIROBI, KENYA (90%)",CORRUPTION (92%); BRIBERY (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (77%); LAND LEASES (71%); PROPERTY LEASES (71%); PURCHASING & PROCUREMENT (68%) Kenya; Corruption; Governance; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Siaya senator James Orengo, suspended Labour CS Kazungu Kambi and Transport PS Nduva Muli are currently at the EACC for questioning over corruption allegations.

The bitter pill of truth we should all swallow, is that we 'ordinary Kenyans' have contributed to the corruption facing our nation today. Our leaders, especially political leaders are here to address the needs of the community, county or the nation as a whole. As Kenyans, we must put the interests of the nation above our individual and selfish interests. Notably to say, many of the elected and appointed public officers are even afraid of going back to their constituencies. When people come to see them they come with all sorts of personal problems. We must understand that it is hard for a politician or leader who gives money for weddings, circumcision ceremonies, and other personal matters, to also address the important needs of the society, like education, health and jobs. Where do you expect them to get that extra money if not from the CDF kitty or sale of grabbed land? Interesting also, there's a culture, very common in many families for all the family members to rely on one able person's sweat. There is nothing wrong for a person who has the means to assist his relatives and friends. Our religions support generosity, and this should be encouraged. But that is not an excuse for them to depend on him or her to solve ALL their problems. We should learn to ask for help from others only when it is necessary. Many good people became corrupt because they wanted to satisfy the insatiable needs of their family members. We must stop asking people to do things that they can't afford within their legitimate earnings. Now Kenyans are so good at this. We always complain that our leaders are corrupt. It is true that many of them are corrupt. You have read the news headlines, watched TV and checked on the social media. All manner of corruption scandals involving our leaders. Our nation, sadly, worships and glorifies these leaders and politicians that have acquired their wealth by looting public treasury. If we continue to measure success solely based on acquisition of material things like money, land, buildings and so on, are we not promoting corruption? There is nothing impressive in stealing public funds. We must stop respecting people with questionable sources of wealth. If possible, we must condemn them to death - that is; if they would rather die than resign. It is even hard to fight corruption if we think that what is happening to our leaders or senior public servants is not important to us as ordinary Kenyans. The fight against corruption has deteriorated because of this attitude. We treat our leaders as if they are not Kenyans, as if they are small gods. Well, they may not be 'ordinary Kenyans' but at least they are Kenyans. We must understand that what affects our leaders affects everyone. Lastly, we suffer from a disease called 'Selective Amnesia'. We either forget or forgive easily. And we choose what to forget! We formally and informally make corrupt and incompetent leaders feel that they are still important. Our leaders can now do and get away with almost anything. You are free to forgive them, but don't forget. We must stop celebrating and honouring the people who created our problems, just because they have changed political parties.

Even gender roles reflect our society. The person serving drinks is typically female, carrying her bottles around in a basket; while the meat is served by men with low BMI, who come to the table and cut the grilled piece of meat. Unlike food cooked at home, typically by women, grilling meat is taken to be a man's job and not without reason. Meat cooked over an open flame takes us back to the original man, who went to the supermarket with a spear. The temperature of good quality charcoal can reach 2,000 degrees Celsius, enough to melt iron. What makes the meat cooked over charcoal tastes so good is how the direct heat interacts with the meat. Unlike say, boiling food where the water is at about 100 degrees Celsius, the grill's high temperature rapidly browns the meat on the outside creating the intense flavours we desire. The skill of the person grilling the meat is then to manage the process of making sure the inside of the meat cooks sufficiently without burning the outside of the meat. The person who is able to grill well becomes a celebrity. It is therefore not surprising that when persons are named in a list of shame, they almost look forward to being 'grilled', taking on society to show that these high temperatures mean nothing to them. But like all things good, there are always risks and in the case of nyama choma, eating a lot of grilled food has been associated with various diseases, primarily cancer. Many people on reading this will sigh, but everything is associated with one disease or another, best to just live after all, one has to die of something! The challenge however is that most of us are living longer and chronic diseases such as cancer have the capacity to make the best years of our lives miserable. Avoiding them for as long as we can therefore makes sense. Cancer are a group of related diseases in which some of the body's cells divide and grow non-stop invading surrounding normal tissue. Cancer can be a solid tumour or in the blood and affect any part of the body. There is no specific cause, but four factors are commonly cited; genetics, the environment, socio-economic status' and your personal. In many ways cancer is just like corruption and it is interesting that we use many of the same words to describe corruption. The word 'corruption' is mid fourteenth century European meaning the breakdown of material things especially dead bodies but also of the soul. Today it is defined as the misuse of public office for private gain. Just like cancer, corruption is a group of practices. Four types are recognised; bribery, nepotism, fraud and embezzlement. Corruption can be grand or petty and it can be systematic where corrupt individuals dominate major institutions and the practice is integrated into the social and political system. A cancerous tumour can be benign, growing slowly and localised or it can be malignant aggressively invading surrounding tissues and spreading to the entire body. Signs and symptoms depend on the type of tumour, where it is located and whether it is malignant or not. A benign tumour can usually be removed and often does not recur. A malignant tumour usually has spread from its' original site, symptoms are varied and management requires extensive, aggressive and prolonged treatment, often at great risk to the life of the patient. Many patients do not survive the treatment. Holistic management of cancer therefore requires that we look at prevention. The problem as always is raising an alarm to something that appears invisible. But think about it the way we have managed polio. We still have in our society people who suffered polio, because it is only in the last ten years that it has been aggressively tackled globally and most of us cannot imagine that polio used to be so common. And it has been done by immunizing one child at a time. In similar fashion preventing cancer is about understanding the risk then managing our lifestyle one day at a time. By all means eat your nyama choma but do so in moderation. This quantity and type of meal that you are having is it really to be had every day? Corruption too is a big monster, but it is about daily practices. The World Bank talks about transparency and reciprocity, whether I would be happy letting others know what I was doing and if I would object if others did the same thing? Corruption does not allow us to enjoy the benefits of government because the health facility never gets built or the health worker does not get paid on time. As long as you remain healthy this might not be a problem, but one day for all us in our lives the day comes when we have to face this cancer.

Two commissioners from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission have resigned in rapid succession, and the chairman is under investigation by a Judicial Tribunal. This surprisingly taking place shortly after the President had taken unprecedented action against his own Cabinet members and senior government employees alleged accused of corruption. In a hard-hitting statement in his State of the Nation address to Parliament, the President instructed the Director of Public Prosecutions to indict and charge the officials within 60 days, if and where there was evidence of corruption. Before the ink on the Presidential statement had dried, Parliament moved to dissolve the EACC and swiftly recommended the appointment of a Judicial Tribunal. Despite protestations by commissioners that systemic corruption, and in particular persons involved in the Anglo Leasing scandal were fighting back with the sole aim of their removal or extermination, they were unceremoniously hounded out of office. They were condemned to the same fate as their predecessors, John Harun Mwau, Aaron Ringeera and PLO Lumumba. Which brings us to the question, do Kenyans honestly and forthrightly want to tackle corruption, or are we simply engaging in window dressing? How can non-other than the President of the Republic of Kenya declare outright war on corruption, only for a Parliamentary Committee to devise a method of scuttling the same? What is the point of having an Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission that is not only toothless but is regularly and flippantly emasculated by Parliament? Or could there be a cabal of powerful individuals out to sabotage the national putsch against corruption? Conspiracy theorists including the opposition coalition Cord are on record as stating the government is insincere about tackling corruption. Some political columnists have recently had the courage to state that the EACC was created to fry the small fish, that is, petty corruption and never ever mega corruption. It was, therefore, a faí_ade to hoodwink gullible Kenyans that the state was intent on eradicating graft when in fact it was silently facilitating the same. Some EACC officials in the course of their duties either due to inflated egos and possibly illusions of grandeur, on occasion ventured beyond their unwritten and unspoken mandate leading to their immediate ouster. If any of these theories bear even a scintilla of truth then our fight against corruption faces an arduous uphill battle. Mega corruption in Kenya is thought to have begun with the Kenren Fertiliser scandal in the mid 1970s. Details of the same, however, remain scanty. The biggest scandal was Goldenberg, during the watch of retired President Daniel Arap Moi, the effects of which are felt far and wide almost bringing our economy to its knees. It was swiftly followed by Anglo Leasing which was manufactured during the same term but matured during the watch of retired President Mwai Kibaki in our third government. In all these mega scandals, the architects were senior government officials with connections in very high places, and offices occasionally colluding with corrupt and unscrupulous businessmen. The tentacles of mega corruption like the hydra of Greek mythology are multi-headed and multifaceted. They have their links across several political regimes since independence. The architects and beneficiaries of multi-corruption are extremely wealthy and powerful, and have agents in every sector of our economy including Parliament and government. Efforts at eradicating corruption, therefore, require support from the highest office in the land; otherwise they are doomed to fail. The decision by President Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta to take the bull of corruption by the horns, the political and economic interests of its architects notwithstanding, was extremely courageous and noble. It was a move in the right direction as was acknowledged by the standing ovation by Parliamentarians. Known to be fabulously wealthy and one of the few Kenyan leaders who have not engaged in or benefited from corruption, citizens have high hopes in his setting structures to eradicate systemic corruption in Kenya. The Jubilee government is perhaps the only one in recent times that has not rewarded itself with a mega-corruption scandal immediately after a Presidential and general election. Much is therefore expected of them and failure would not augur well for their 2017 re-election."923,The Star (Nairobi),5/11/2015,"DPP Approves Wairia, Adul's Prosecution Over Corruption Claims",,SINGAPORE (79%); KENYA (79%),,,Newspaper,Nancy Agutu,ENGLISH,236 words,,11-May-15,,CORRUPTION (92%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); APPROVALS (90%); MISCONDUCT (88%); EVIDENCE (78%); ETHICS (77%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (76%); COUNTIES (76%); MISAPPROPRIATION (75%); GRANTS & GIFTS (72%); FOOD CHARITIES (52%) Kenya; Corruption,"DPP Keriako Tobiko has approved the prosecution of Murang'a Governor Mwangi Wairia, Kisumu Speaker Anne Adul and MPs Alfred Keter and Sonia Birdi over corruption.

The Chairman of the National Anti-corruption Commission, CONAC, says there is still a lot of resistance by some government ministries to fighting the ill. Speaking at the Yaounde Conference yesterday, October 30, 2014, at the public presentation of results of the seventh phase of the campaign involving 26 government ministries, State-funded projects and corporations, Rev. Dr. Dieudonní© Massi Gams, said despite a presidential directive, some ministries were yet to engage in the fight. On the other hand, some ministries launch highly publicised, supposed anti-corruption campaigns, only to end at that level; with nothing done on the field after. He cited the glaring case of 38 stakeholders that engaged in the seventh phase of the anti-corruption drive on April 15, 2014, but 12 later dropped out for unknown reasons. Thus, only 26 stakeholders completed the Rapid Results Initiative, which entailed targeting specific aspects of corruption in their organisations and combatting them in 100 days. Dr Massi Gams acknowledged that fighting corruption in any part of the world was fraught with obstacles, adding that this should not in any way discourage stakeholders. The CONAC Chair called on the ministries, State corporations and projects, which had embarked on the fight to sustain the campaign. He expressed hope that the fight will be taken to the grassroots for Cameroonians to feel the impact, pointing out that the ultimate judge of the efforts was the public. The Chairman of the National Anti-corruption Commission was also hopeful that Cameroon's fight against the ill will ultimately yield palpable results; without which the country cannot become emergent by 2035. He said the desire was to one day become like Botswana which has been adjudged to be the least corrupt African nation. Talking about the case of the Cameroon National Oil Refinery, SONARA, the General Manager, Talba Malla, said focus this time was on curbing malpractices in the loading of oil tankers with petroleum products. Though he said an 80 per cent success rate was recorded within 100 days, there was still a long way to go as both the State and oil tanker owners needed to get their right due from such transactions.

Representatives from some women's associations that advocate the promotion and protection of human rights are undergoing training in Yaounde organized by Transparency International-Cameroon on how they can actively be involved in the fight against corruption. A two-day workshop opened yesterday September 25, 2014, at the TI-Cameroon Headquarters, Yaounde to challenge them denounce corruption acts. TI-Cameroon holds that women are shy and reluctant to denounce acts of corruption that demean and push the country's economy to the wall. The international anti-corruption body challenged them to embrace and utilize its Advocacy and Legal Advisory Centre to stop corruption from spreading like cancer in the country. Opening yesterday's get-together, TI-Cameroon's President, Barrister Charles Nguini, enjoined the women to relay to the various associations and communities the need to join national and international partners in winning the war on corruption by reporting cases for exposure. They were reminded that TI-Cameroon's Advocacy and Advisory Centre is ready to assists them structure their complaints, propose follow-up to their files, analyse data and conduct advocacy for policy changes as well as work in partnership with lawyers continuously registered with the Cameroon Bar Association; in order to provide free legal assistance to victims and witnesses of corruption. TI-Cameroon reveals that out of 600 victims of corruption recorded in Cameroon recently, only 52 cases (about 8 per cent) are denounced by women. And given the preponderant role they play in the family and the education of the child, they should therefore be core actresses in the fight against corruption. Reason why yesterday's workshop that ends today September 26, 2014, is baptised: ""Women and the Fight Against Corruption,"" to sensitise them on the importance alongside mechanisms on waging a serious war against the scourge."929,Cameroon Tribune (Yaoundí©),9/4/2014,Evaluating the Cost of Corruption,,CAMEROON (94%),,,Newspaper,Kimeng Hilton Ndukong,ENGLISH,373 words,,5-Sep-14,"YAOUNDE, CAMEROON (88%)",CORRUPTION (92%); WRITERS (90%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (88%); CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY (87%); NATIONAL LIBRARIES (78%); LITERATURE (77%); JOURNALISM (77%); CREATIVE WRITING (77%); LIBRARIES (71%); MUSEUMS & GALLERIES (71%) Cameroon; Corruption,"There is no gainsaying that corruption has already been identified as a major hindrance to Cameroon's development. The fact that the country has twice been infamously listed as the most corrupt nation in the world has not left the authorities and creative writers indifferent. And so Sammy Oke Akombi's latest literary piece, 'The Wages Of Corruption,' was launched in Yaounde on Friday, August 29, 2014, at the Contemporary Arts Gallery/National Library. Speaking at the event, the first reviewer, Jerome Ndjock, a Sub-Director in the Ministry of Communication, said most characters in the 13 stories seek to improve their livelihoods by hook or crook. He described corruption as the consequence of the deviant behaviour of Cameroonians, not a curse. According to him, the solution to the problem lies in leading a life guided by a free conscience. The second reviewer, former university rector, Prof. Beban Sammy Chumbow, described the author as an evangelist crusading against corruption. Corruption, he noted, is so endemic in the country that the stories, which he qualified as a compendium of episodes, better portray it through their true-to-life angling with which readers can easily identify. Referring to Biblical consequences of sin, Prof. Chumbow said corruption attracts curses and damnation even much later in life. ""The book is well-written in simple pose, making copious use of idiomatic expressions, with the episodes believable. The author has researched well into the subject and everyone who reads it will be touched. It x-rays corruption to help the common man see it from various dimensions. 'The Wages Of Corruption' is therefore a mirror of various facets of corruption in our society,"" concluded Prof. Beban Sammy Chumbow. Commenting on his work, Sammy Oke Akombi, who is Director of the Buea Pilot Linguistic Centre in the South West Region, said society should not wait for things to get out of hand before taking strong action against corruption. The event also saw an ovation-reception for a recital of the poem, 'To my brother the thief,' by Sammy Oke Akombi, which was performed by a group of young boys. The chair of the occasion was Mrs. Lydia Efimba, while veteran journalist, Eno Chris Oben, served as compere."930,Cameroon Tribune (Yaoundí©),7/13/2014,Britain Advocates Anti-Corruption Law,,UNITED KINGDOM (96%); CAMEROON (94%); EUROPE (79%); AFRICA (79%),,,Newspaper,Victorine Biy-Nfor,ENGLISH,281 words,,14-Jul-14,"YAOUNDE, CAMEROON (90%)",CORRUPTION (95%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (90%); EMERGING MARKETS (89%); BRIBERY (78%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (77%) Cameroon; Corruption; Governance; Europe and Africa,"The British High Commissioner to Cameroon, Brian Olley, encouraged Cameroon to adopt an anti-corruption law as quickly as possible to curb the scourge and entice investors so as to jump start the country's economic growth. The British diplomat was speaking to the press in Yaounde on Thursday July 10, 2014 at his residence ahead of a round-table discussion on challenges in tackling corruption in Cameroon. The round-table brought together stakeholders from the government, British business community in Cameroon as well as the private sector. Brian Olley explained that corruption inhibits economic growth of countries around the globe but was proud to announce that the United Kingdom (UK) remains the lone country in the world with the strongest anti-corruption law. The 2010 Anti-bribery Act which compels British companies anywhere in the world to subject to the law has been a plus in tackling the canker worm. He therefore announced his country's willingness to share the contours of such an act with stakeholders in the fight against corruption in Cameroon so as to benefit businesses. The Anti-bribery Act in use for over four years is causing panic amongst corporate bodies in Britain and people are being prosecuted under it. The British High Commissioner revealed his determination to work with government and the private sector more efficiently. Given that corruption is one of the greatest constraints to development and that where it prevails, resources are wasted and mismanaged, potential for investments remains untapped and investors are deterred participants at last Thursday's round-table discussed how reinforced training can help reduce and why not eradicate the scourge."931,Cameroon Tribune (Yaoundí©),7/4/2014,Government Pledges Renewed War Against Corruption,,CAMEROON (92%),,,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,2649 words,,7-Jul-14,"YAOUNDE, CAMEROON (90%)",CORRUPTION (90%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (90%); PRESS CONFERENCES (90%); EMBEZZLEMENT (89%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (89%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (89%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (88%); SENTENCING (62%); TRIAL & PROCEDURE (60%) Cameroon; Corruption,"The Minister of Communication, Issa Tchiroma Bakary, read out the following statement at a press briefing in Yaounde on July 3, 2014. The Minister of State, Minister of Justice, Keeper of the Seals, The Secretary General of the Ministry of Justice, The Secretary General of the Ministry of Communication, The Inspector General, Technical Advisers, Distinguished Inspectors, Distinguished Directors and Head of Divisions, Distinguished Collaborators, Fellow Journalists, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is with a renewed pleasure that I welcome you, once again, in this conference hall of my ministry which has become the usual venue of our meetings, to exchange, in all conviviality and frankness, on issues of major importance relating to the life of our nation and the well-being of our populations. It is about the fight against the embezzlement of public funds initiated by the Head of State, His Excellency Paul BIYA, also known as the "" fight against corruption "". Allow me first of all, to acknowledge the presence, of His Excellency, the Minister of State, Minister of Justice, Keeper of the Seals, who has, in spite of his tight agenda, accepted to be here with me for this press briefing. Mr. Minister of State, you are welcome to the Ministry of Communication. Allow me also to take this opportunity to wish you all, fellow journalists, a warm welcome in this conference hall, and to thank you all, for your prompt reaction to the invitation I sent to you today. Dear Guests, Fellow Journalists As you must have noticed, for the past few weeks, there is a certain opinion restlessly working to throw doubt on the sincerity of the fight against corruption inscribed and underscored by the Head of State in his priority actions to restore good behaviours and guarantee the protection of public wealth. This opinion, widely relayed by a range of both national and international media, seems to be grounded on the commutation and remittance of sentences following the presidential decree nÁ2014/058 of 18 February, 2014 to commit and remit sentences, and which, undoubtedly for the first time, was extended to our compatriots sentenced for embezzling public funds. This opinion claims that the release of some prisoners, pursuant to presidential decree of last February 18, or even only under normal judicial procedures, would ring a death knell on the crusade against embezzlement of public funds led by the Head of State and the judicial branch of our country. This interpretation of facts, which I qualify as inaccurate, leads me to first throw light and give some details that are necessary for understanding the situation, and secondly, to express the full determination of the President of the Republic, His Excellency Paul BIYA, to relentlessly continue without any complacency, the fight against the embezzlement of public funds in our country. Regarding the decree of 18 February 2014 to commute and remit sentences, allow me to first of all underline that the Constitution of the Republic of Cameroon states that the President of the Republic "" exercises the power of mercy ... "". Mercy by definition is the partial or full commutation and remittance of sentences, conditioned or not by safety measures and probation obligations. Meanwhile, mercy remains without effect on the sentence and applies only to the execution of the sentence. Pecuniary sentences (damages, cost of the procedure) remain due. This important text of the Head of State, the decree of 18 February 2014, came out in an exceptional context, full of history and significance for the life of our nation. This had to do with the commemoration of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Reunification of our dear and beautiful country, which was an opportunity for us to celebrate the virtues of national unity, peace and tolerance, so dear to the Cameroonian people. Reacting on this issue at the end of the ceremony to inaugurate the Fiftieth Anniversaries' Monument in Buea, the Head of State seized the opportunity to explain to his compatriots the real reasons justifying his decision to sign this decree which, also, falls within the prerogatives conferred to him by the Constitution of Cameroon. Allow me to quote him once again: "" With regard to the remittance of sentences, this is to show the importance for us to nurture unity. I wanted it to be a great moment of joy. And that, this joy should also reach even those who were somehow at war with the law. Some have also recovered their freedom. We want it to be a great moment of joy and happiness to enhance national unity "", end of quote. Moreover, it is worth highlighting that the decree of 18 February 2014 is a text of general scope and immediate effect, applicable to all those falling within the framework of the 13 cases targeted in the 13 paragraphs of the said decree. Regarding the persons sentenced to prison terms for embezzlement of public funds, the pertinent provisions are contained in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of the abovementioned decree. It therefore appears that a total of 24 000 prisoners across 77 prisons benefited from the presidential mercy. It is clear as you may have noticed that this decree was not tailored to suit specific prisoners as falsely claimed by a given opinion. Dear Journalists, Distinguished guests, Since his accession to the helm of the Nation on 6 November 1982, the Head of State has made the fight against corruption and misappropriation of public funds a constant orientation of his policy, as clearly emphasized in his different addresses to the Nation. Thus, in his very first inauguration speech before parliamentarians at the National Assembly on 6 November 1982, the President of the Republic, His Excellency Paul BIYA set the course for this relentless fight he was intending against all managers misappropriating public funds in the following terms and I quote: "" In these tough times we are going through, the great and long process of nation building implies... rigour in management and perseverance in effort against manoeuvres of demoralization, demobilization and destabilization "". Since then, he has kept reasserting his firm commitment to taking repressive action against acts of corruption and embezzlement of public funds. In his end of year address to the nation on 31 December 2005, the Head of State, in a peremptory tone, firmly denounced and condemned this social ill, in the following words : "" The embezzlement of public funds is detrimental to the national community. Let me very solemnly say it today, that it must stop "", end of quote. In the same vein, in his communication during the Ministerial Council of 12 September 2007, the President of the Republic, His Excellency Paul BIYA, reiterated his determination to fight this ill. Let me quote him again: "" The embezzlement of public funds, no matter which form it may take, is a crime against the People that are being deprived of their resources. This must therefore be severely sanctioned "", end of quote. Such determination which, as we all noticed, is not an improvisation in the Governance policy of the President of the Republic, was translated by the creation of several institutions vested with specific missions, each one in their area of competence, and which are provided with the necessary means to systematically track down cases of misappropriation of public funds. The actions carried out by the Supreme State Audit which is the gendarme or better still the secular arm of the State in matters of control of the sound management of public funds fall within this framework. In the same vein and as far as the specific domains of money laundering and corruption are concerned, the National Financial Investigation Agency (ANIF) and the National Anti-Corruption Commission (CONAC) were set up in May 2005 and March 2006 respectively. In a certain measure, administrations like the Ministry of Public Contracts, the General Delegation for National Security, the Secretariat of State in charge of the Gendarmerie, or the Public Contracts Regulatory Board, actively participate in the fight against corruption, each one in its area of competence. All these administrations are fully operational today and perform their duties in this field on a daily basis. Today, there is no doubt on that those people who attempt to misappropriate public funds are tracked down wherever they may be, arrested and put at the disposal of the judiciary which in all independency, establishes the responsibilities of all. Dear Journalists, Dear Guests, Allow me now to give some indications on the creation and implementation of the Special Criminal Court (SCC), set up by virtue of Law nÁ2001/028 of 14 December 2011. It is undoubtedly to, first, stress on the political will to confer a specific character to the fight against corruption, and secondly, to solve the issue of celerity in the settlement of legal disputes relating to the organized economic and financial criminality, that the Head of State proposed to Members of Parliament to set up this special jurisdiction. The Special Criminal Court, which is not a court of exception, aims essentially at fighting the misappropriation of public funds whereby the prejudice incurred by the State is equal to or above fifty million CFA francs. In order to guarantee an efficient functioning of the Special Criminal Court, the President of the Republic has signed different instruments, including Decree No. 2013/131 of 03 May 2013 relating to the establishment, organisation, functioning of the specialized Corps of Judicial Police Officers of the Special Criminal Court. Moreover, the modalities for the paying back of the corpus delicti are established by Decree No. 2013/228 of 04 September 2013. This new provision, pursuant to the provisions of article 18 of the law establishing the Special Criminal Court, habilitates the Public Prosecutor at the Special Criminal Court to terminate any prosecution, upon written authorization from the Minister of Justice, when the corpus delicti has been paid back. It is worth underlining that both the courts of first instance and high courts are competent in this matter, when the embezzled funds amount to less than fifty million (FCFA 50 000 000). The whole of these legal instruments created by the Head of State are today fully functional and the processing of cases forwarded to the Special Criminal Court by High Courts has been obviously speeded-up. For instance, 119 cases from High Courts have been transferred to the Special Criminal Court. Thirty nine (39) of these cases were immediately enrolled. These cases have been subject to or are still subject to public hearings which are, and it is worth mentioning, open to all. As concerns the cases undergoing judicial investigation, to date, 19 defendants have benefited from a dismissal of charges and one hundred and seven (107) were referred back to the Special Criminal Court. As of 3 April 2014, the Special Criminal Court has ruled over fifty-two (52) cases among which 36 on the merits and 16 on the preliminaries. Twenty-six (26) defendants have been freed, and 51 sentenced. Some of them have appealed. With the effective putting in place of the Specialized Corps of Judicial Police Officers of the Special Criminal Court, some investigations have resumed. Now, as far as the sums due to the State are concerned, these are related to the paying back of the corpus delicti in cash, fines, and costs of procedure as well as damages. As for the issue of paying back the corpus delicti by some defendants who solicited the stay of proceedings, the sums already paid into State coffers and which were deposited in an account open at the Public Treasury, amount to two billion four hundred and one million two hundred and thirty five thousand six hundred and ten CFA Francs (2 billion 401 million 235 thousand 610). Sixteen arrested persons have already benefited from this measure. Concerning fines and procedure costs, these are estimated at one million CFA francs and six hundred and two million three hundred and twenty-three thousand six hundred and twelve CFA Francs (602 million 323 thousand 612 CFA Francs). To date, the Special Criminal Court has already ruled for the payment of damages worth twelve billion one hundred and sixty-four million six hundred and eighty-two thousand five hundred and four CFA Francs (164 million 682 thousand 504 CFA Francs). Dear Journalists, Dear Guests, As we all notice, the mission of the Special Criminal Court is neither to condemn at all costs, nor pronounce only acquittals, even though there is a certain opinion believing this to be the way one can truly judge the independency of the judiciary. The Special Criminal Court is a common law jurisdiction whose functioning is contingent upon sustainability and is not to be viewed in terms of "" operation "". So, even if some defendants have already been sentenced or acquitted by a given partisan opinion, all of them, whoever they may be, should benefit from the presumption of innocence and we should all respect the secrecy of not only the judicial investigations but also the secrecy of preliminary investigations. Allow me to remark in relation to this, that every judicial procedure can lead either to a condemnation for proven fact, or a dismissal of charges for unproven fact, or an acquittal. In another case, every inmate may, as it was the case in February, from mercy, commutation of sentence, or remission of sentence. These of course are a prerogative of the Head of State as provided by the Constitution. It is worth mentioning that, the power of a conviction does not make it a truth. Therefore, whatever the opinion, rumour, convictions of one or others, the judge is solely empowered to pronounce the guilt or acquittal of a defendant. And if one considers his trial to be unfair, he or she is entitled to refer to appeal courts provided for by the law. Fellow Journalists, Dear Guests, The importance which the Head of State confers to fostering good morals and to the priority of the general interest in the management of public funds, which are undeniably a pillar of our development, can never be overemphasized. Therefore, on 15 September 2011, during the Third Ordinary Congress of the Cameroon Peoples' Democratic Movement, the Head of State, in his general policy opening speech, did not miss, once again, to warn CPDM militants and all managers of public wealth. And I quote: "" Be aware, Ladies and Gentlemen, that my determination to fight this scourge is total and the fight against corruption will go on with more intensity, without fear and complacency, discrimination, notwithstanding the social status or the political affiliation of the accused persons. Nobody should consider himself to be above the law "", end of quote. Recently, the Head of State, in his 31 December 2013 address to the Nation, severely criticized selfish attitudes of some of our compatriots, who do not refrain from taking all necessary steps for their personal success at the detriment of the general interest. Allow me to quote him once again: "" Our Administration remains permeable to selfish interest. This is most often incompatible with the interest of the national community. In a modern State, this drift cannot be tolerated "", end of quote. This determination of the President of the Republic to relentlessly fight corruption and embezzlement of public funds, which is a precondition for the effective development and emergence of Cameroon by 2035, requires the entire support of the People who vested this task upon him. The administration of justice is a mission conferred to a special corps by the Constitution. This is the reason why I invite Cameroonians of all walks of life to give entire support to our judiciary and to let the Special Criminal Court and other relevant courts to work in all serenity in order to issue fair decisions within a reasonable timeframe and as set forth by the law. Thank you for your kind attention."932,The Star (Nairobi),5/12/2015,Isaac Rutto at EACC Over Corruption Claims,,KENYA (87%),,,Newspaper,Nancy Agutu,ENGLISH,122 words,,12-May-15,,CORRUPTION (90%); LAWYERS (87%); EMERGENCY VEHICLES (70%); GAS STATIONS (52%) Kenya; Corruption,"Bomet Goverrnor Isaac Rutto is at the EACC for questioning on graft claims stated in a report tabled before the Senate in March.

Consequently, he has ordered all State corporations to furnish his office with details of their anti-graft strategy - within two weeks. Stung by the runaway corruption, Uhuru, in a hard-hitting but confidential Executive Order, bitterly protested ""outright theft and blatant breaches of ethical standards"" by State and public officers. In a rare confession, the President said that the conduct of some State and public officers falls far short of the demands of the constitution and Kenyans' expectations. ""Corruption and its network have acted as constraints to the desire of my administration to deliver effective public services,"" Uhuru lamented in the Executive Order exclusively obtained by the Star. ""These unsavoury, unethical and corrupt practices continue to be perpetuated and thrive in spite of various reminders and warnings."" In a bold move to restore confidence in the public service, the President, who flew out to Japan yesterday, instructed all State corporations to furnish his office with what he termed ""a comprehensive action plan"" against corruption. ""The action plan must contain: express timelines, identified responsible officers and means of measurement and delivery, against which the extent of compliance and implementation shall be gauged,"" he ordered. The Executive Order, dated last week, was copied to all Cabinet secretaries, Principal secretaries, the attorney general and chief executive officers of all constitutional and State corporations plus county commissioners. Part of the directive is that all State corporations must within two weeks furnish his office with details of all procurement deals sealed since his administration took over in 2013 - complete with contract value and awardees. The Jubilee administration has been hit by a series of mega sleaze scams, including the Sh50 million ChickenGate affair, the Sh100 million 'Hustler's Jet' probe and a Sh2 billion Judiciary scandal. Budalang'i MP Ababu Namwamba has, for instance, linked Defence Principal Secretary Mutea Iringo to the bribery of at least four MPs in a bid to water down a Parliamentary Accounts Committee report on embezzlement of Sh2.8 billion. ""At the meeting, it was agreed that Mr. Iringo would provide money and facilitate business opportunities at the Department of Defence (DoD). At least KSh 1.5 million is confirmed to have been collected in cash from Mr. Iringo,"" Ababu said in a letter to National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi. Uhuru also directed all State corporations to immediately arrange to migrate their procurement systems to an electronic procurement platform. ""Communication about the status of migration should reach my office within two weeks of receipt of this Executive Order. Any delay shall invite corrective action,"" he warned. In what appears to be a strategy to face off with corrupt officers, the President urged civil servants to directly get in touch with his office should they receive pressure to engage in unethical, corrupt or illegal conduct. ""In furtherance of the mission to get rid of corruption, I am, therefore, directing all relevant institutions in the Ethics and Anti-graft War (EACC, DPP and National Police Service) to act swiftly, without fear or favour, and take necessary measures to detect, investigate and prosecute all instances of corruption in all its manifestations, irrespective of the status of the perpetrators,"" he directed. Uhuru warned that every accounting or responsible officer shall be held personally liable for any use or movement of public monies contrary to the law, including prosecution and recovery of any loss. Critics have accused Uhuru of failing to sack Energy Minister Davis Chirchir even after the latter's implication by a British court in the ChickenGate sleaze, one of the most well-documented corruption cases in Kenyan history."934,The Star (Nairobi),3/12/2015,City Stadium a Haven for Corruption - Reps,,KENYA (93%),,,Newspaper,Chrispinus Wekesa,ENGLISH,202 words,,12-Mar-15,"NAIROBI, KENYA (74%)",STADIUMS & ARENAS (91%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); PARKING SPACES & FACILITIES (90%); COUNTIES (78%); SPORTS & RECREATION FACILITIES & VENUES (73%); SPORTS & RECREATION (55%); SPORTS (55%) Kenya; Corruption,"Nairobi MCAs yesterday accused the county executive of condoning corruption in the renovation of City Stadium.

Ochola, who is the chairperson of the Committee on Labour and Social Welfare, tabled the report in the county assembly yesterday. The report said security within the stadium is not guaranteed and the parking lot is not secured nor landscaped. MCAs recommended that the shanty structures outside stadium be demolished. They urged the executive to put up modern kiosks at City Stadium. ""Our planning department should review the plan of the stadiums parking lot and clearly demarcate parking lot and other designated areas for development,"" Ochola said.

Raila said investigating agencies must not narrow down to one individual since corruption allegations consisted of a ""receiver"" and a ""giver."" He noted that Parliament had mentioned the receiver but said nothing of the giver. The Cord leader made the remarks amid Parliament's Powers and Privileges Committee plans to summon him to shed light on corruption allegations facing PAC chairman Ababu Namwamba. Namwamba is said to have secretly taped a private conversation between him and the ODM party leader, in which an MP admitted receiving cash to influence a PAC report. A faction of ODM leaders has called for Ababu's sacking as Secretary General of the party, citing a betrayal of trust. ""If indeed it's true that Namwamba taped Raila without consent, then that smacks of betrayal of trust and a sign of bad faith whatever reason there could be,"" said ODM Treasurer Timothy Bosire.

It is not tribalism or negative ethnicity either. Our greatest threat is corruption. The popular narrative on corruption blames it all on the high and mighty, the so called 'political elite'. It is convenient to blame the leadership and the rich. It gives the storytellers, analysts and the general public a feel-good effect of pointing outwards to others. In any case, the rich and powerful are not exactly innocent, not all of them anyway. The truth is, corruption is endemic and deeply entrenched in the mindset, behaviour and shallow value system of the majority of ordinary Kenyans. The poor use their unfortunate circumstances to justify their attitude towards corruption. They enthusiastically support and engage in it whenever an opportunity presents itself, like during elections, when they demand bribes from all candidates without any verifiable commitment to vote for any of them, except those carried by ethnic waves. The middle-class are in a rat race to live a certain lifestyle. To them, the end justifies the means. Most corrupt deals require a significant input of technical skills from middle-class engineers, architects, land surveyors, lawyers, accountants, bankers, IT hackers, skilled politicians and businessmen. Thus corruption networks across both public and private sectors are endemic. The furore and condemnation comes only if someone is caught, but they will do their utmost to protect each other, which is often successful given their instinct for survival and their technical skills. This widespread social blight now threatens our new system of devolved government. The level of noise and confrontations at the county level is not about poor governance. It is in fact a manifestation of infighting for new corruption opportunities and self aggrandisement. We need to expose and arrest the situation urgently. Devolved corruption is now the greatest threat to our national success and well-being. The ongoing fiasco in Narok county is a classic example of how infighting for opportunities of devolved corruption has turned into political noise. The Narok government gave the job of collecting revenue from the Masai Mara to a private company with a good reputation in the private sector, where it has achieved significant success both in Kenya and in East Africa. The granting of this contract was done in a transparent, open-tender process. Some of those who lost in the tender process challenged the award at the Public Procurement Oversight Authority as provided by law. They lost. They then appealed at the High Court and lost again. But the challenge is ongoing, now disguised as noise and political agitation in Narok town. The monster that is devolved corruption is threatening to dislodge an ethical, efficient private sector company whose conduct is beyond reproach, from a business contract won competitively in an open-tender process that has been scrutinised by PPOA and the High Court. How can the people of Narok, not just their leaders, condone and support such behaviour? In Makueni, those who know the extremely stubborn disposition of Governor Kivutha Kibwana will understand that the flippant expectations of a largely corrupt group of MCAs and their cohorts have no chance whatsoever of breaking his resolve. He will not yield to corruption-driven blackmail. He would rather go home. That is why Makueni people are en route to electing a new county government. If Kibwana is reelected together with a team he can work with, it will be a huge blow to corruption, which appears to be entrenched in the minds of ordinary citizens. It is ordinary people who have to reject corruption and corrupt people. For our sake, let's hope that governors Samuel Tanui and Kibwana succeed in stemming devolved corruption now disguised as political agitation. That feat will one day have to be repeated by a President at the national level before we can claim to have a reasonable chance of slaying the corruption monster.

Uhuru spoke the same week an evaluation report by the Public Service Commission showed the authorities are not doing enough to deal with corrupt civil servants. The PSC reported that 77 per cent of those accused have been acquitted. Uhuru can still become the President of Kenya who cracked the whip corruption in government by translating fine words into action. He could borrow a leaf from Tanzania's Jakaya Kikwete, who recently fired a Cabinet minister. Kikwete also accepted the AG's resignation and suspended the Energy PS in a scam that has rocked his government and severely strained relations with donors. Uhuru has invaluable Swiss assistance on the money laundering aspects of some of the worst of the Anglo Leasing scams. He can also deal definitively with the Kenyan end of the ChickenGate printing contracts scam in which a UK court has found the British players guilty of bribing specific Kenyan officials.

The 78-year-old Swiss citizen had promised to stand down after his fourth four-year term but is now seeking a fifth term. Fifa, under the leadership of Blatter and his Brazilian predecessor Joao Havelange, has ably demonstrated that corruption knows no boundaries. Fifa has suffered scandal after scandal. Last month Fifa's ethics investigator Michael Garcia resigned claiming that his report into corruption surrounding the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids had been ignored and watered down. Change is desperately needed. Prince Ali, president of Jordanian football since 1999 and a respected army officer, wanted the Garcia report published to kick-start the Fifa clean-up. Ali is the vice-president of the Asian Football Confederation and will be supported by UEFA, the European football association. He has a credible chance of dethroning Blatter. Africa is too often unfairly tarred with the brush of corruption. Here is Africa's chance to stand up and end the culture of impunity at Fifa. All football associations will have one secret vote.

The Siaya county Scorecard is a social audit report of November 2014, compiled from a survey carried out by the Siaya County Leadership and Development Forum through a Social Audit Panel of eminent persons and was presented to the public at Ambira High school last month. It indicated that about 50 per cent of the Sh1.2 billion development budget in 2013/4 financial year was lost through corruption. More than 250 Siaya residents participated in the survey. They rated the governor and his government 100 per cent ""poor"" on corruption, and ""below average"" on performance- covering service delivery, development and good leadership. The report further indicates that there was only a superficial involvement of the people in the preparation of the county integrated development plan (CIDP) and the county budget, as a way to fulfill the requirements from the controller of budget and hence no ownership among the people of Siaya. The public was not very involved in the planning stages due to poor mobilisation and poor attendance of public consulation meetings due to the short notices given. According to the report, the governor was violating the Constitution and the County Government Act by failing to hold public briefing sessions in town-hall type meetings after every three months. It also revealed that the peoples' project choices and prioritisation did not always hold in the final CIDP as some projects which people had prioritised at Ward level were altered by the county government in the final documents. The worst part is failure to involve people in the planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of development projects. ""Corruption has hampered service delivery in the county government, and there is no doubt about the involvement of the executive because it is not taking any action,"" said the report. It was alleged that the governor and some MCAs actively participated in tendering processes hence flouting the tendering regulations and involving themselves in corruption. This is after reports that one contractor was allegedly asked to go with his MCA to the officer in charge of payments at the finance office. According to the respondents, most of those awarded the tenders were either cronies or relatives of the governor or certain MCAs. There were serious allegations that awarding contracts for most road construction projects was directly handled by the top office in the executive in collaboration with some MCAs, who gave contracts and tenders to their own companies or companies where they had interests, eliciting emotional reactions from the disenchanted respondents, the report further revealed. The report, corroborated by several respondents, says that a top official in the executive is known to have the habit of using the discriminative comment of ""...he was not our person"" or ""he was not with us"" whenever he hears that some contractors whom he perceives not to be politically correct are about to be awarded. Lack of fairness and indeed corruption in tendering was said to be the weakest point of the county government. ""Failure to follow procedures, favoritism and blatant corruption in tendering were the worst and most glaring violations of good governance by the county government."" The county project documents revealed extreme overpricing, and direct observations by the Social Audit Panel revealed poor workmanship condoned by those in charge of ensuring quality. Most projects were by far, over-priced and poorly done. ""How do you justify spending Sh3 million on a two-door toilet at Nyamonye market?"" posed the finding. The general feeling of most respondents further indicates that health services were at a standstill due to lack of personnel, drugs and consumables. ""There is also poor reception and handling of patients at the health centres"", said the report, adding that the resident felt that county government had no plan for the health sector hence the mass exodus of senior health staffs. Respondents compared Siaya with other counties and saw their county government as disappointing, citing Busia County next door, where the main referral hospital was being upgraded as one of the county's flagship projects for improving service delivery. While most respondents expressed disappointment, some gave the government the benefit of doubt because of the interruption of the governor's term when the county went for a by-election. According to several groups, the county government is performing below expectations in terms of failing to implement projects on schedule and distribution of major public service appointments. There is no unique development or poverty eradication vision to make people have hope or be inspired adding that there no visible change or improvement in service delivery. The Siaya County CEC in charge of Governance and Administration, Amos Okello, responded during the presentation that the county government welcomed such criticism. He requested that the panel share with the county government such a report in good time in future for a proper response. The Ombudsman maintained that social audit was a constitutional tool enshrined in the constitution to offer checks and balances on the use of public offices and appealed for wide participation in social audit. ""Social Audit is a requirement in the Constitution, which requires for public participation on the available resources,"" added Amollo, saying his recommendations would be based on the interest of Siaya people. The Former Alego/Usonga MP, Sammy Weya regretted that the county government had failed in vouching for discussions with elected leaders on development agenda for the county. Weya cited over 90 per cent of funds translating to billions of shillings channelled to the county government in the 2014-2015 financial year is lying idle in the treasury as the county failed to spend it. He said such funds, through consultation with key stakeholders would have been put into viable use for the benefit of the county people who are yearning for improved service delivery. Weya, who was accompanied by former Siaya County Council chairman Aggrey Onyango, called for the prosecution of county leaders who have orchestrated the misuse of the taxpayers' funds for their selfish interests to the chagrin of the suffering public. Community Aid International Programme coordinator, Mwende Mutua, said their organisation was not out to fight county governments but to empower communities to play a watch dog role over their resources and public affairs. Mwende said the project was being implemented in three counties including Kilifi, Makueni and Siaya adding that similar exercise will be rolled over in other counties."943,The Star (Nairobi),12/17/2014,"Step Up War On Corruption, Mandago Urges Eacc Chair",,KENYA (77%),,,Newspaper,Mathews Ndanyi,ENGLISH,89 words,,17-Dec-14,,CORRUPTION (90%); ETHICS (87%) Kenya; Corruption,"UASIN Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago has asked EACC chairman Mumo Matemu to strengthen the EACC regional office in Eldoret so that it can tackle cases of graft.

""However, I do not expect personal vendetta or business rivalries to be the sole motivation for reporting,"" Uhuru said. The president at the same time announced that a National Ethics and Anti-corruption policy developed to streamline the war on graft, as well as the promotion of integrity and accountability in the public sector service provision will be ready for implementation by June 2015. Uhuru said that it is corruption and a lack of integrity that hampers the economic growth potential of countries and not a lack of resources and infrastructure. ""Fighting corruption effectively requires team work. It is your duty and mine to end the vice,"" Uhuru said. Chairman of the Ethics and Anti-corruption commission Mumo Matemu on his part called on the signatories to the United Nations Convention against Corruption to fast-track establishment of democratic institutions that will fight graft. ""It serves to remind all UNCAC signatories of their obligation to build democratic institutions responsive to the needs of their people, improve the openness and accountability of their administrations, control public spending and uphold their constitutions,"" Matemu said. The EACC chairman who is also currently serving as the president of the East African Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities said that the efforts being made against graft should be collective. ""It is only when Kenyans at all levels commit themselves decisively to this fight individually and collectively that the country will register meaningful success in the fight against corruption,"" Matemu said.

The vulnerability of the country in security is linked to highly corrupt criminalised state with weak institutions of governance that create safe haven for organised crime to thrive. Yet the solutions offered go only very little. Incremental change remains significantly ineffective to Kenya situation. Gains made in reforming state are quickly eroded. Different sustained strategy is crucial. Decisive tackling of criminalisation of politics offer critical entry point. Criminalisation of politics is the pivotal pillar that feed and facilitates the systemic decay of the Kenya state. Kenya Security Sector has irredeemably lost its reputation and credibility. Huge financial resources are allocated to security organs but there are no results. Every concerned Kenyan unequivocally condemns abominable attacks and killings innocent civilians. People must exercise great restrain from interpreting these senseless unjustifiable killings as inter-religious conflict. These are abhorrent criminal acts. The escalating insecurity is partially the outcome of institutional inertia in the absence of coherent national security policy, crime intelligence based strategy and of operational simplicity on part of the Kenya security agencies. Kenya has no law enforcement and crime prevention strategy. Overall, President Uhuru Kenyatta government must develop a comprehensive integrated law enforcement strategy. The current reactive security and law enforcement policies are ill-defined, incoherent and shallow. President Kenyatta administration mostly continues to put out immediate security fires but the overall deterrence capacity of security and law enforcement agencies remain very limited and largely unable to detect and preempt crime. The security policy reform momentum has prematurely dissipated. President Uhuru Kenyatta is offering little substantive leadership to the chronic problems confronting the country. He has wrong personnel assisting him in governing the country. However, he is the one responsible. He must be held to account to the people of Kenya and to the law of the land. If he cannot provide leadership of substance and tangible action, then he is the problem. Civil society does not accept 'fall guys' theory. It is the President culpable. Constitution introduced major governance and institutional changes in Kenya to improve accountability on public service delivery. Security sector was not spared. However, the security sector, whose reputation, credibility and professionalism was irredeemably battered, continues to operate in old model. This makes it ineffective, vulnerable and irrelevant, jeopardising the security of the people and the country. The first responsibility of any President is to protect the people and securing the country. The citizens are true owners of the state. They maintain and control the government, while the government serves the citizens and is accountable to them. Failure to meet that core duty and obligation cause government dissolution. The state's first duty to its citizens is to provide full security. The President ensures the highest standards of transparency and openness for institutions responsible for the security of the state and its citizens. Further, the President enforces highest moral and professional standards for those officials who serve there. It is the obligation of the President to ensure that institutions responsible for the security of the state and its citizens are fully depoliticised and protected from undue interference by politicians and from ruling elite influence. The President provides critical leadership and strategy to strengthen security. President must ensure the country has the prerequisite and necessary tools and capabilities to find, disrupt and destroy criminals and their hideouts. Accordingly, the constitution's framers viewed the security of the nation to be the foremost responsibility of the national government. Constitution places paramount authority for security in a single executive with clear accountability and checks. The President has the power, and bears the responsibility, to make tough decisions at a moment's notice. President Uhuru Kenyatta and his coterie of advisers have obstinately refused to take this constitutional obligation and responsibility for securing the country. Rather than addressing the constitutional obligation demands, the President is absconding. He has forfeited political legitimacy to govern. Buck stops with President The Constitution of Kenya, in Article 29(c) provides: ""Every person has the right to freedom and security of the person, which includes the right not to be...subject to any form of violence, from either public or private sources..."" Further, Article 131 provides that the President of the Republic of Kenya, is ""the Commander-in-Chief of the Kenya Defence Forces...and is the chairperson of the National Security Council. The council, in accordance with Article 240(7), shall ""integrate the domestic, foreign and military policies relating to national security in order to enable the national security organs, to cooperate and function effectively."" ""Consequently, the National Security Council shall ""assess and appraise the objectives, commitments and risks to the republic in respect of actual or potential national security capabilities."" In furtherance of the above, the national security organs primary objective is to ""promote and guarantee national security in accordance with principles mentioned in Article 238(2): ""The national security organs are National Police Service, Kenya Defence Forces and the National Intelligence Service. Get rid of county commissioners confusions. Inspector General of National Police Service David Kimaiyo forced resignation under pressure is welcome. However, it is drop in the ocean. The deep-seated structural and policy problems inflicting the system must the changed. There must be far-reaching systematic overhaul of the entire security system and national security policy. People of Kenya must not buy into change of guard. The President must lead with responsive, sensitive and accountable leadership. President must abandon political campaign spin. People of Kenya want serious actionable solutions of substance. President must hire competent and expertise staff from Cabinet Secretary downwards. The President must execute tough decisions and sanctions on corruption and corrupt practices inside the government and security agencies. President should engage the National Security Council and less the National Security Advisory Committee on National Security Policy, so that the government can address threats in a comprehensive manner. The effectiveness of the security sector can be improved by optimising every security sector. The National Security Council chaired by Mr Uhuru Kenyatta, Council on Administration of Justice chaired by Dr Willy Mutunga and Council of Governors chaired by Mr Isaac Ruto must work collectively to offer sustainable solution to the unacceptable and socio-political stability threatening security situation in Kenya. While building up the operational capacity of security agencies is crucial, there is need to pay enough attention to building the institutional capacity and the human capital security civilian institutions in order to sustain security over the long term. National Security Council should execute its constitutional mandate and spearhead the process of the drafting and fully implementation of the national security strategy. It should also provide policy guidance into Crime Prevention strategy to the State Department of Internal Security and National Police Service. Further, the council should set adequate and effective oversight mechanism of enforcing its decisions. The council should develop review and coordination mechanism of the Strategy and Crime Prevention policy. The National Security Advisory Committee is subordinate to the council and not policy decision-making body. Finally, National Security Council, together with State Department of Internal Security, Council of Governors, Council on Administration of Justice, Office of Director of Public Prosecutions and National Police Service should establish and strengthen the County Policing and Law Enforcement Authority. The authority should review the security policy decisions set by National Security Council at national level, specifically affecting particular county and overall, and the security concerns of the local population in order to set security and law enforcement priorities of the county. County National Police Service leadership, Command and Security spokesperson structure should be under-experienced management expertise police officer in charge appointed competitively on merit by National Police Service Commission. The officer will chair the County Policing and Law Enforcement Technical Committee. County Policing and Security Authority should be strengthened and fully operationalised under chair of county governor. The authority will review county related prioritised security issues by National Security Council and public security concerns to make its decisions. The Policing and Law Enforcement Technical Committee is responsible and answerable in implementation of authority decisions and law enforcement operations. The police officer is accountable to office of Inspector General, NPSC and County Authority. He or she should publish County Security and Law Enforcement monthly report. This ensures security and justice services are available to ordinary citizens with accountability of both national and county governments. The officer is accountable for speaking matters policing and law enforcement in the county. County commissioners cannot usurp constitution arrangement of the security.

These units are inefficient and a lot of man-hours and money are lost as operators of public service and commercial vehicles queue for hours on end waiting for their vehicles to be inspected and re-inspected in case they are turned away to carry out repairs or replace parts. No wonder then that most would rather pay the bribe upfront and avoid the agony of the queues and the back and forth game of ""repair this, replace that"". If, as suggested, every vehicle that is over four years old is to be inspected, you can imagine the nightmare that would result. Kenyans would be forced to queue at these inspection centres for days on end. They would waste weeks as the inspectors take them back and forth to 'fit this and repair that'. Many of course would opt to bribe their way out of the mess thereby quadrupling the corruption. Others unable to bribe their way at the units or through brokers to get stickers at the comfort of their offices and homes, will prefer to bribe the traffic police officers and NTSA officials on the road, again adding to the graft menace. There have been rumours that a sizeable part of the bribes extorted by traffic police officers on our roads finds its way to some very high echelons of the police force. Does this then mean that a percentage of the money that would be collected by the fellows at the inspection units and by police and NSTA officers on the road, would find its way to the pockets of senior government officials? For what purpose would this money be used? Then there is the money that would be genuinely collected at the inspection units and as fines for noncompliance, which reminds me of the days when the Kenyatta International Convention (Conference) Center was being built. I am told that to raise funds for the construction, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta's regime rounded up and fined petty offenders, mostly drinkers of traditional beers. The colonial government had banned the brewing and consumption of traditional liquor, and when Kenyatta came to power, Attorney General Charles Njonjo chose to keep the draconian rule in the law books. As the story goes, police officers would on a daily basis raid muratina and busaa dens, round up revellers and cram them in cells. Others would be picked by the roadside and all charged with being drunk and disorderly, whether intoxicated or not. To avoid being locked up in remand for prolonged periods, most, if not all, pleaded guilty to the offence even if they were not and paid the fine. This tradition of Kenyans pleading guilty to petty crimes, mostly related to being drunk and disorderly, has held to date. The Jubilee government has a lot of financial obligations and unfortunately there has been a lot of wastage through the bloated government brought about by devolution. It is also true that some bureaucrats in government are trying hard to make as much money as they possibly could, with the 2017 general election at the back of their minds. Could the government then allay fears that it is trying to build another 'KICC' through the new NTSA rules? More money is being collected through the sometimes absurd 50km per hour city limit rule. Could 2017 have anything to do with it? Of course the cream of the crop in Kenya including new kids on the block in government can afford to drive off from DT Dobie in brand-new limousines, but most Kenyans import second-hand cars that are about eight years old. It would be a nightmare to inspect the thousands of cars that are more than four years old. And however well the cars are maintained, it's common knowledge that the traffic police or vehicle inspection officers will always find fault with the car, even where none exist.

The number of deaths from inferior and illicit alcoholic drinks, mostly brews and liquors, in 2014 alone is now past the 150 mark. This is a terrible state of affairs. Illicit liquor retailers' stills and dens operate in the plain sight of administrators and police, including criminal intelligence sleuths. However, corruption keeps the trade going, with the bribes going straight to entire police and administration command hierarchies in the locations involved. The sight of poverty-stricken Kenyans periodically drinking poisonous concoctions and dying in large numbers is such a dreadful prospect that, back in May, the Kikuyu Council of Elders urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to declare the menace a national disaster. Long before the elders appealed to the President, he had given a three-month ultimatum in 2013 to administrators nationwide to wipe out the poison alcohol menace. Corrupt policing and administration and feeble laws have conspired to give Kenyans one of the most moronic situations anywhere on earth: the spectacle of illegal alcohol vendors who literally poison their customers and drinkers who seemingly do not learn from the lethal mistakes of others.

To avoid death, the vision of Kenya must be to develop from third, to first world. To realise the vision of development, however, there are obstacles: Negative ethnicity, which is second to corruption. The vision of developing Kenya from poverty must go hand in hand with the vision of eradicating negative ethnicity because a house at war with itself cannot stand and an economy perpetually robbed cannot grow. Indeed, elimination of negative ethnicity and eradication of corruption are a prerequisite of developing the country. Just as a robber cannot steal without arming oneself with some weapon, the corrupt arm themselves with leadership, office, influence and power to rob government and country. Just as robbing national resources requires power, checkmating corruption requires greater power, influence and leadership that only president has. Without presidential power, corruption cannot be stopped because people with lesser power than the corrupt cannot stop them from stealing. Corruption is only stopped where presidential or highest power is applied against corruption. However much the nation might wish to be rid of corruption, where presidential power is not applied against corruption, war against graft is lost. To paraphrase Malcolm X that power only respects greater power, the power of the corrupt only respects greater power of integrity. In Kenya, because power of the president has not been applied against corruption, graft has won the war with integrity. If the president agrees to pit his power against corruption and integrity wins the war against graft, credit will be his. But if the president refuses to pit his great power against corruption and graft wins the war, blame will be his too. In Kenya, the war against corruption is lost already and the people to blame are Presidents Kenyatta, Moi, Kibaki and now Uhuru. We blame old presidents for old corruption and blame President Uhuru for ongoing corruption of the last two years and some graft of the Kanu and Kibaki regimes he was part of and whose rule he approved of. Under President Uhuru as under the other presidents, corruption has been all pervasive. Government loses more than 337 billions every year. Controller and Auditor General cited CDF and Office of the President for corruption of billions. Kenya Police has been ranked third most corrupt in the world and Kenyan corporate corruption has been ranked number one in the world. Recently, President Uhuru was hailed for denouncing land-grabbing in Lamu, but that has been taken back when CS of Land Ministry Charity Ngilu exonerated old land-grabbing because it was government sanctioned. In her view, only ongoing and government unapproved land-grabbing should be stopped. President Uhuru should have rebuked this exoneration of corruption but he did not, probably in his own defence. Failure to rebuke defence of corruption was compounded by President Uhuru's denial of corruption in the Standard Railway project and paying money to Anglo Leasing project. The genesis of Uhuru's weakness in fighting corruption could be connected to President Kenyatta's regime, to which Uhuru is inexorably linked by lineage of blood, economy and politics. Unfortunately for Uhuru, President Kenyatta planted the roots of corruption when he permitted civil servants to engage in business while still in government. When people complained, Kenyatta replied: ""My bird hide. If you are caught, you are not mine."" Kenyatta also castigated Bildad Kaggia for not enriching himself as a leader. Apart from Kenyatta lineage, there are other reasons why the war against corruption will not be won by President Uhuru. Verbally, Uhuru condemns corruption but he is a disciple of capitalism that is the mother of corruption. Though he condemns corruption, Uhuru has not combated the evil with the power of example as Presidents General Murtala Mohammed, Thomas Sankara and Julius Nyerere almost decimated corruption in their countries with the power of example. Personally, Uhuru has not championed the war against corruption by dealing a death blow to anyone corrupt in his office, government or party. President Uhuru has not stated anywhere that his desired legacy is elimination of corruption or eradication of negative ethnicity. Whether we like it or not, to a large extent President Uhuru will be judged by characters of his personal friends, political comrades, advisers, business companions, defenders and even enemies. If any of Uhuru's associates are corrupt, he too will look corrupt. Like his father, Uhuru has not banned civil servants from doing business while in government, an activity that can only be corrupt. President Uhuru has not disassociated himself with the notion that the president or governor also owns government, country or county to eat with friends and family members. All people Uhuru has put into government have no reputation of being warriors against corruption. Despite corruption being a culture that should be uprooted, Uhuru has not championed the culture of integrity to take its place. And because negative ethnicity and graft are allies, Uhuru cannot fight graft without fighting negative ethnicity, which is the bedrock of Kenyan politics. If Uhuru embraces negative ethnicity, he cannot be an enemy of corruption. And as negative ethnicity, corruption and poverty will determine the fate of Kenya, and five years of Uhuru Presidency, without fighting graft it will be too long a respite for them. President Uhuru must fight graft or openly tell Kenyans they are on their own."957,The Star (Nairobi),8/23/2014,Corruption and Anti-Terror Dragnets,,KENYA (98%); UNITED STATES (94%); AFRICA (88%),,,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,1104 words,,25-Aug-14,"NAIROBI, KENYA (88%)",COUNTERTERRORISM (92%); TERRORISM (91%); CORRUPTION (90%); ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (90%); INTERNATIONAL LAW (90%); CARTELS (88%); AL-SHABAAB (78%); PASSPORTS & VISAS (77%); IMMIGRATION (77%); FOREIGN INVESTMENT (77%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (75%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (74%); DEPORTATION (74%); IMMIGRATION LAW (74%); ESPIONAGE (72%); INVESTIGATIONS (68%); MONEY LAUNDERING (67%); MUSLIMS & ISLAM (61%); LICENSES & PERMITS (60%) Kenya; Corruption; International Terrorism,"WHEN President Uhuru Kenyatta jetted back to Kenya after attending the US-Africa Leaders' Summit in Washington, DC, the first thing he emphasised was that investors must be assured that their investments will be protected by the recently opened international investment arbitration centre. He noted that the Nairobi Centre for International Arbitration, whose board was installed last year, will make all investors comfortable by covering all bases of dispute. Analysts were quick to note that international arbitration has become the preferred method among dispute resolution processes the world over in the early 21st century, as it saves on both time and money by delivering quicker decisions that are easier to enforce than court judgments. All this is probably news to the NIS and immigration authorities in Kenya, who automatically do not allow investors to wind up their businesses, dispose of assets, pay and collect debts before they deport them, usually on information provided by business rivals and predator corruption cartels that target certain kinds of investors. The law of natural justice requires that the accused, even on purely intelligence, immigration and counterterrorism matters, must be heard. A system that filters adverse information received by the Kenyan authorities from business rivals and extortion cartels, and indeed all other sources, must be put in place. Indeed, it is these cartels that must be disbanded without compromise. They constitute corporate terrorism. What Kenyan senior intelligence and counterterrorism officials and the agents under their command or leadership must appreciate is that anti-terrorism is increasingly a fully documented and researched process, including at university level. It is no longer just a matter of secret files that never see the light of day, even in court, or maximum non-disclosure. If you have the evidence, and it is the solid fruit of diligent spying and investigation and can indeed stand up in courts of law locally, regionally and internationally, then by all means make full disclosure, protecting only the identities of frontline agents and sources. Why is evidential disclosure so increasingly important? The deportation from Kenya in November 2013 of Pakistani businessman and long-term investor in this country Nadeem Iqbal Mohamed was reportedly on the grounds that he was into money laundering, organised crime and al Shabaab-compliant. None of these suspicions were scrutinised by a court of law. Nadeem was 'tried' entirely in the court of public opinion on elliptical, minimalist and highly suggestive grounds. It was apparently enough that he is Pakistani and Muslim. Nadeem's brother Wasim Iqbal Mohamed was left behind to continue with their business empire, built assiduously across 16 years and employing hundreds of ordinary Kenyans. The Iqbal brothers pay tax in Kenya to the tune of northwards of Sh400 million annually. They should be getting pursuit-of-excellence and prosperity awards, not long-range and intercontinental character assassination. Now Wasim is struggling to remain in Kenya and has seen renewal of his work permit denied and then permitted, and yet someone, somewhere in the NIS and at immigration is still hounding him. The intention is clearly to drive the Iqbals out of Kenya, acquire their businesses and transplant them. Also as clear as crystal, is the fact that massive raw corruption is at work here. The biggest loser in this sort of compromise is Kenya's hard-won reputation as an investment destination-of-choice country, where investors are extended every enabling environment and protection. There is a corresponding danger - if Kenya's anti-terrorism agencies open themselves to being used as extortionate bludgeons, too many national security factors will fly out every available window, leaving this country increasingly vulnerable and bereft of investors. A 2011 report sponsored by the British Equality and Human Rights Commission and published by the University of Durham, also of the UK, should be required reading for Kenyan counterterrorism officials and field agents. Entitled, 'The impact of counterterrorism measures on Muslim communities,' it was written by researchers Tufyal Choudhry and Helen Fenwick. The foreword to this landmark report was written by Baroness Hussein Ece, a BEHR commissioner. It contains the following eye-opening remarks: ""The prevention of terrorism is about protecting some of our most basic human rights - a fact which sometimes get lost in the debate about terror prevention and human rights. ""The question for any government is how best to provide that protection. Experience from Northern Ireland teaches us that counterterrorism measures have the potential to stigmatise whole communities, to fuel resentment and even to bolster support for terrorism movements. ""There is a danger that Muslims in contemporary Britain may become the new suspect community. Policymakers and operatives are grappling with this old dilemma - it is an inescapable fact that the majority of those suspected of terrorist activities are Muslim, and that counterterrorism measures are likely to target Muslims. Clearly, however, those measures will be counterproductive if they make ordinary British Muslims, who are of course just as affected by the terrorist threat as anyone else, feel they are constantly under suspicion"". For every mention of British in the foregoing, just substitute Kenyan and the message strikes home with some force. And please bear in mind that all these delicate factors and problems in Britain's counter-terror efforts are minus the corruption-Kenyan-style factor. Add raw corruption and you get a truly toxic mix. Wasim argues passionately that his brother is a victim of extortion rings that continue to harass international businesspeople who bear Muslim names in Kenya. He also speaks darkly of cartels in Kenyan ministries. He told a Sunday newspaper last week: ""As I waited for the renewal of my permit between January and June, I was told by the criminal cartels that it would be rejected if I did not pay millions of shillings. It was indeed rejected"". The Iqbal brothers' saga was among the last things in outgoing NIS boss Michael Gichangi's in-tray. Director General of Intelligence nominee Major General Philip Wachira Kameru would do well to get to the bottom of the shenanigans and skullduggery surrounding the massive undermining of, and the vendetta against, the Iqbals' investments in Kenya early in his tenure. Maj Gen Kameru must strive to the maximum to keep the dragon of corruption out of the process of the counterterrorism dragnet in Kenya."958,The Star (Nairobi),8/22/2014,Mtwapa Residents Protest Poor Infrastructure and Corruption in Kilifi,,KENYA (93%),,,Newspaper,Martin Mwita,ENGLISH,104 words,,22-Aug-14,,COUNTY GOVERNMENT (90%); COUNTIES (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (90%) Kenya; Corruption; Industry and Infrastructure,"RESIDENTS of Mtwapa town, Kilifi have protested poor infrastruture in the county.

It is sad because Jomo Kenyatta was an intellectual who was counted among the Pan-African movement founding fathers of emerging independent African nations. They knew capitalism was a mortal enemy of culture and religion, and all loathed it. These men were egalitarians at heart, with Kenyatta openly declaring that our country would be run based on African traditions and ethics (Democratic African Socialism). Along the way somehow, somewhere, Kenyatta met a reality check. When addressing nervous settlers in Nakuru on being elected Prime Minister in 1963, he shocked his listeners and his advisers alike, when he told the settlers, inter alia, that he would take care of their interests and that they needn't leave the country. America had just emerged as the dominant western world power and two significant events had taken place. In 1953, America orchestrated the overthrow of Iranian democratically-elected leader (Mossadegh - who had nationalised Shell Oil) in a coup, sending a clear message to all leaders in the Middle East. Six years later, in January 1961, democratically-elected Prime Minister of mineral rich Congo, Patrice Lumumba, was similarly, through American CIA supported coup, overthrown and executed by the firing squad. Lumumba was a Pan-Africanist who had told his former master, Belgium - ""We are no longer your monkeys"", and had made clear his intentions to nationalise the mines because the wealth of the nation belonged to the Congolese people. During this period his counterpart to be, the future Kenyan Prime Minister Jomo Kenyatta, was under house arrest in Lodwar and was released from there in August that same year. Those shots fired at Lumumba were heard by all African leaders - the choice was theirs to make. The west had just made it clear that independence was not meant to disrupt existing western business arrangements or other interests. But the west also pacified and took care of those leaders who heeded the warning. To them was given western protection and they and their families were well looked after by the western corporations, with some of their family members sitting in western corporation board rooms. With Kenyatta's idealism dead, it was replaced by a penchant for authoritarianism, which often leads to excesses and corruption, and Kenyatta was no exception to this rule. Kenyatta was forced to surrender to the very system he had sworn to do away with. He also ignored Pan-Africanism and concentrated his efforts warding off his colleagues who wanted an egalitarian system in Kenya, while at the same time amassing enormous family fortune by virtue of his position as President of Kenya. Jomo Kenyatta's incubated mess of corruption passed over to the next two Kenyan generations. The second President whose simple philosophy was Nyayo (following footsteps), stepped right into the mess and carried it forward with excesses that were gross. The country became so corrupt and his leadership so authoritarian that you could not with any practical sense differentiate the three arms of government. Parliament had no force and the Judiciary for all intents and purposes was a department in the office of the President. All structures of government were eviscerated with all authority belonging to the President and his henchmen. It is during Moi's government that wealth replaced to a large extent the character of a person and the society lost itself in economic cannibalism. The corrupt systems of power could therefore pillage without fear of any repercussions. Today, the incubated corruption has broken out into the lawlessness, and the insecurity we find ourselves confronted with today. Uhuru and Raila are surrounded by people deep in the vice and neither can stop corruption. As a result of corruption, we are now a country constituted of two people, the haves and the have-nots. The haves have wrestled constitutional power from the people and have oriented themselves towards dominance and prejudice. The have-nots suffer from hunger and a cloud of servitude hangs over them. Half are unemployed with three quarters of this burden being shouldered by the youth. Yet one of every three shillings in Treasury is being stolen through corruption. The Githongo's and the Lumumba's of anti-corruption commissions are put in place as window dressing for no one can realistically step where the snakes coil, and that is why invariably they are all run off when they get close to the den. Our economy must stop hemorrhaging money through corruption, or we will self-destruct and join the litany of failed states. We have to affirm our civic virtue and shared sacrifice for the benefit of all Kenyans by shoring our defenses against the vice. To this end, we should take it as a duty to assist others who need to be helped to rise above ignorance and attain knowledge that supports their rightful action against the vice of corruption, and spread that ""ripple of hope,"" for ignorance is the wall that contains people as inmates of poverty. Government business is the people's business and government budget is everybody's budget. Secondly, corruption is responsible for many deaths in Kenyan by means such as lack of health and sanitation, hunger, lawlessness and so on. In shoring up defences against it, corruption involving public funds and assets ought to be punished by reciprocating the death penalty. For reasons stated above, anti-corruption commissions can't work - in our system we may need a body that incorporates justices from outside Kenya, such as from commonwealth countries, to investigate and deal without fear or favour with our sinful happy fraudsters. Lastly, we need to return Kenya to an atmosphere of unity. Our problems will not go away unless we address the economic crimes of the past. Perhaps we could use a set up in the fashion of a truth and reconciliation commission as a starting point to right the wrongs, wherein fugitive money and investments can be returned by applying restorative rather retributive justice, without vindictiveness or bitterness. And lastly, let us remember ""all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."""961,The Star (Nairobi),8/15/2014,Corruption Probe for Kirinyaga Executive,,KENYA (92%),,,Newspaper,Jane Mugambi,ENGLISH,220 words,,15-Aug-14,"NAIROBI, KENYA (54%)",MISCONDUCT (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); CORRUPTION (78%); RECRUITMENT & HIRING (75%); MISAPPROPRIATION (73%); DISMISSALS (73%); HOSPITALS (72%) Kenya; Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs; Governance,"A nine-member committee has been formed to probe Kirinyaga county Health executive Joyce Muriithi.

An insider at the EACC's Integrity Centre HQ confided to the Star that the Commission is compiling documentation on how the Committee handled its investigations into the Sh14.7 billion Safaricom tender deal. The deal is for the provision of a national surveillance, communication, command and control system for the National Police Service. It is meant to help the security forces to rise to the challenges of identifying criminals as well as improving coordination and rapid response to crime and terror incidents as they unfold. Though the Committee, chaired by Tiaty MP Asman Kamama, tabled its report in the House on Thursday approving the deal, EACC has commenced its investigation over claims that MPs may have been compromised. The Committee's investigations were triggered following a public uproar over the manner in which the project was given out, with claims that it was awarded in disregard of the procurement laws. ""As a Commission we are relying on information provided to us by one of their own. The Commission also notes that senior individuals who were to appear before the Committee did not and instead it went on to clear the tender without the input of those who failed to appear,"" the official said. ""It is also clear that the Committee disapproved the tender ab initio, but we want to find out whether the Committee's initial stance was an act of staking a higher bargain,"" adds the officer, saying that the Commission will recommend prosecution if the claims are supported. There have been complaints that MPs oppose government projects only to approve them later after ""dubious and questionable"" investigations. The Transport and Infrastructure committee chaired by Starehe MP Maina Kamanda is another one also being investigated by the EACC. The other committees that have come under EACC scrutiny are Energy, Information and Communication Chaired by Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau, Labour and Social Welfare of David Were (Matungu) and Health, chaired by Rachael Nyamai (Kitui South). An MP who sits in the Security Committee and who did not want to be named said that it was indeed compromised. He said that the Committee duplicated every detail of information given by key witnesses and that it had nothing of its own. ""The media is also to blame for the untoward conduct of the Committee. When the chairman launched the investigations, he spoke so tough against the tender and then potential witnesses but this fizzled out. It is the same thing that happened with the Committee and at some time you media people were locked out of the meetings - this was negotiation time if you didn't know,"" the MP revealed. While clearing the deal, the Committee recommended that the project should continue and that there was no ulterior motive on the choice of single-sourcing Safaricom to implement it. ""The company has the requisite financial capability and the experience in providing a telecommunications network and infrastructure in the country. Given the urgency and the precarious security situation in the country, Safaricom was the most appropriate entity to implement the project,"" the committee recommended. The report went on to say: ""The Committee was also satisfied that due diligence was carried out and that the procurement process was aboveboard, with all the necessary stakeholders consulted"". The officer was categorical that EACC was not against the MPs' approving the communication and surveillance system, but the manner in which the probe was conducted. However, it will require the approval of the House if the project is to continue. Already, a section of Cord MPs have vowed to shoot down the report, or adopt it with far-reaching amendments."964,The Star (Nairobi),7/17/2014,County to Fight Corruption,,KENYA (79%),,,Newspaper,Stanley Njenga,ENGLISH,92 words,,17-Jul-14,,CORRUPTION (91%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (88%); COUNTIES (88%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (88%) Kenya; Corruption,"The Kiambu government has embarked on a new strategy to fight corruption.

The money is not chickenfeed - it can be up to Sh200,000 per recruit. And today the Star has run a Spotlight story that police have continued to extort money from residents of Eastleigh long after the end of the security sweep that started in April. Allegedly police are rounding up children and threatening to lock them up at Kasarani unless their parents pay a ransom to have them released. Corruption in recruitment and in the Eastleigh sweep are connected. The police have to recover the investment that they made to get the job. Kenya remains far more insecure than Uganda, Tanzania or Rwanda. And, regrettably, the Kenyan police are more corrupt than their counterparts in neighbouring countries. Kenyan insecurity is correlated to corruption in the security services. Al Shabaab operatives or ivory poachers in Kenya will be given enough money to pay a hefty bribe to the police if they are caught. No wonder the security operation in Eastleigh did not net a single terrorist despite harassing residents for months. No wonder poachers are rarely caught despite the mass slaughter of our wildlife. End corruption and we will end insecurity. Quote of the day: ""Things will get better if you just hold out long enough.

Simon Kimutai, chairman of the Matatu Owners Association, said at least 30 per cent of daily collections never reach vehicle owners, ""as it is either used in bribing, stolen by crew or pay for incidents of road mischief"". ""Cashless payment will therefore curb issues of carelessness on our roads. They are mostly occasioned by the mindset that the offender will pay for it with the cash they collect,"" Kimutai told The Star. It is estimated that more than Sh150 million is collected by matatus daily in Nairobi alone, with corruption on the roads thriving due to the free-flowing cash. Matatu owners however say the State reneged on an agreement that migration to cashless payment platform would be gradual so as to giver users ample time to understand the system's dynamics. They now want the government to drop its stance of issuing deadlines for the sector to adopt a cashless payment system. Kimutai said customer education is needed before passengers can be restricted to cashless systems to pay for fare, lest the whole process fails. A zoning approach should be used in big towns, Kimutai said, to ensure smooth transition. ""We can, for example, start with a route like Ngong where the passengers are educated then assisted in acquiring the means for paying fare. We will then observe how users shift to paying and work on any teething problems before moving to another route,"" he said.

Zimbabwe has traditionally performed dismally in terms of ease of doing business rankings largely owing to poor governance, policy uncertainty and a high rate of corruption. Top local economist John Robertson told businessdigest corruption cases such as the CMED scam damage the country's reputation and reduce its chances of securing credit. Last week the Zimbabwe Independent reported that the CMED's battle to recover US$3,8 million in a botched fuel deal in which private supplier First Oil failed to deliver paid for fuel had sucked in President Robert Mugabe's office as it has emerged the parastatal, together with government's fuel distributor PetroTrade, approached officials in the Office of the President and Cabinet to resolve the matter. ""There is a lot of indiscipline in government and this is bad when we are looking for lines of credit,"" Robertson said. He said people found guilty of corruption should be prosecuted. Economist Takunda Mugaga said Mugabe should demonstrate seriousness in fighting corruption in high offices. ""Fighting graft at corporate level is proving difficult because parastatal bosses like those at the CMED and GMB, for instance, are just shadows of the bigger ghosts that are untouchable,"" said Mugaga. ""We have heard the First lady (Grace Mugabe) accusing top officials of corruption and this damages the country's reputation so there must be investigations and perpetrators must be dealt with."" Mugaga said Mugabe is in a difficult position where fighting corruption cases involving his lieutenants will likely lead to counter-accusations against him.

The latest instalment of the report beats a familiar path, exposing among others, massive impropriety in most government ministries, the shambolic condition of state enterprises and parastatals, non-production of asset registers and egregious disregard of clearly laid down regulations and procedures. The report comes against the backdrop of sensational media revelations earlier this year of corruption at state enterprises, parastatals and local authorities, with executives raking in ""obscene"" salaries despite the parlous state of their entities and the economy at large. The mildly-anticipated -- on a count of government's record of inaction -- crackdown on graft has since failed to materialise despite systematic, sustained and scandalous revelations. While scarce public funds are channelled towards producing the useful audit report, its production has become a mere ritual for, despite consistently exposing the rot and general malaise at the concerned enterprises, its findings are filed away without adopting corrective measures. During this year's Mid-Term Fiscal policy Review, Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa bemoaned the fact that most of the key public entities continued to underperform, in the process incurring deficits, thus remaining an albatross around the struggling fiscus' neck. as oft-cited in Chiri's reports, Chinamasa said the poor performance of public entities is largely attributable to weak corporate governance systems and resistance to reform proposals by management. ""Challenges related to our public enterprises manifest through unsustainable salaries, allowances and benefits for top managers at the expense of service delivery; weak oversight on public entities underline ministries' purview, absence of boards to give direction to a public entity ... and corrupt practices,"" he said. These challenges highlight the need for government to implement sustainable and practical turn-around strategies, Chinamasa said, without divulging them. But any turnaround intervention not informed -- at least in part -- by Chiri's recommendations would be an exercise in futility. Government is aware of the root cause of the problems perennially bedevilling parastatals and state entities, but remains unmoved to act, giving further credence to the existence of a politically expedient patronage network run by the ruling elite. It is time parliament awoke from its deep slumber and played its oversight role by pressuring ministers to account. While Chiri's reports are conveniently ignored thanks in part to our shirking MPs, South Africa's Public Protector Thuli Madonsela, whose role is analogous to that of our Auditor and Comptroller-General, has given South African President Jacob Zuma and the ruling ANC nightmares on accountability issues. Madonsela reports are taken seriously, with parliament demanding answers and corrective measures."970,Ghanaian Chronicle (Accra),4/29/2015,Evangelical Society Asks Politicians to Confess Corruption Sins,,GHANA (95%),,,Newsletter,Bernice Bessey,ENGLISH,390 words,,29-Apr-15,"ACCRA, GHANA (78%)",RELIGION (92%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY (90%); PRESS CONFERENCES (74%) Ghana; Corruption,"The Ghana Evangelical Society has called for the establishment of a National Week of Confession and Repentance for politicians and citizens to resign from their corrupt practices, evil and wicked ways.

The accusation followed an audit report by auditing firm -Ernst & Young, alleging endemic collusion between the Bulk Oil Distribution Companies (BDCs) and some senior officials of BOST, to fleece the country of millions of Ghana cedis. The report indicated that officials of the BDCs allegedly connived with officers at BOST, through bribery and forged documents, to inflate the volumes of products in favour of the BDCs. However, reacting to the findings of the auditing firm on various media networks yesterday, the CEO of the BDCs, Senyo Horsi accused management of BOST of releasing the report to the media to muddy waters and downplay serious allegations of corruption levelled against the management. Mr. Horsi claimed the BDCs were victims throughout their dealings with BOST, and therefore, could not be accused of any wrongdoing. Workers of BOST are calling on President John Dramani Mahama to urgently set up an independent committee of inquiry to probe their management for involving in what they described as questionable deals, mismanagement, and corruption that were causing financial loss in millions of dollars to the strategic national asset. Some of the allegations include alleged corruption in the million dollar office accommodation rented for BOST at Dzorwulu in Accra; a shady agreement with TSL, a Ghanaian subsidiary of a Nigerian-owned firm in which BOST is to pay TSL a total amount of about $38 million for a year to operate, maintain and manage BOST's petroleum terminals in the country, as well as a budgetary allocation of $16 million for automation across all BOST depots countrywide. Mr. Horsi said the BOST management released the report to the media to cloud these serious allegations levelled against them by their own workers, and to paint a picture that it is rather some officials of the company who are engaged in corruption. The BDCs had been having a running battle with BOST since the TSL agreement was signed, with the former opposed to the deal. According to the BDCs, the whole deal was shrouded in secrecy and lacked the local content policy of Ghana. The Bulk Oil Distributors indicated they had petitioned the Minister for Petroleum and the Board Chairman of BOST one clear week before the signing of the TSL contract, but the petition was not responded to. According to them, the deal violated Ghana's local content laws and was tantamount to ceding control of a strategic national resource to a Nigerian-owned company. The BDCs pointed out the potential risks in the event of a major dispute with Nigeria, with the example of the shortfall in supply of gas through the West Africa Gas Pipeline."972,Ghanaian Chronicle (Accra),3/17/2015,"NPP to Demonstrate in Upper East - Over Mismanagement, Corruption",,GHANA (96%); UNITED STATES (79%),,,Newsletter,William Nlanjerbor Jalulah,ENGLISH,662 words,,17-Mar-15,,CORRUPTION (90%); VOTERS & VOTING (90%); PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (90%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (89%); JOB CREATION (87%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (72%); POLITICAL CANDIDATES (72%); STARTUPS (69%); ENTREPRENEURSHIP (64%); RIVERS (50%) Ghana; Corruption,"REGIONAL EXECUTIVE of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) in the Upper East Region is to embark on a peaceful demonstration on the streets of Bolgatanga on March 26, 2015, to protest against gross mismanagement of the economy and deep-rooted corruption in the Mahama-led administration. At a news conference in Bolgatanga last week Wednesday, the executive said they wish to express on behalf of the good people of the North, their absolute disenchantment with the poor leadership of President John Mahama and his shocking indifference with regards to developmental issues affecting the North. Addressed by the Regional Youth Organizer, Mr. Bashiru Ibrahim, flanked by the Regional Chairman, Mr. Adam Mahama and other executives, the NPP said in the run-up to the 2012 polls, the main message from President Mahama to the good people of the Northern, Upper East and Upper West Regions was that, Northerners should vote for him because he was also a northerner. His message, the NPP noted, resonated with many voters of northern descent across the country, and thus, resulted in electoral advantage the NDC and President were enjoying today. The executive focused on seven key areas of concern to the people of three regions which were described as the poorest. They included the SADA saga, job creation, education, health, leadership, ethnocentrism and the US$ 27 billion Mahama administration had borrowed. On Savannah Accelerated Development Authority (SADA), the NPP recalled that Nana Akufo-Addo's proposal, in the NPP's 2008 campaign, for the establishment of the Northern Development Fund with a seed capital of US$ 1 billion. However, the NPP said President Mahama, who was then the Vice Presidential candidate of the NDC, scoffed at the proposal on the claims that it was a deception and misplaced priority and that, if Nana Akufo-Addo could raise such funds, he should rather have used it to offset the debt owed by the Volta River Authority. Mr. Bashiru Ibrahim said, upon realizing that the policy was indeed catching-up with a lot of Northern electorate, the NDC quickly made a gargantuan U-turn and proposed to establish what they called SADA, and promised to set aside a start-up capital of US$ 200 million and subsequently, inject US$ 1 million into the SADA account every year. Unfortunately, money pumped into SADA could not be accounted for; neither could projects under the authority be traced. Mr. Bashiru and his colleague executives hit hard at President Mahama and his administration for not creating jobs and to make matters worse, jobs created by the erstwhile Kufuor administration such as the National Youth Employment Programme, which was changed to Ghana Youth Employment and Entrepreneurial Agency (GYEEDA) and transmogrified into the creating, looting and sharing of taxpayers' money with impunity. Touching on education, the NPP accused the President and the NDC of short-changing northerners. According to them, feeding grants for second cycle institutions for one academic year had not been released while subventions for these institutions had also not been paid for two terms running. The withdrawal of teacher trainee allowances and the seemingly collapse of the school feeding programme was also condemned by Mr. Bashiru Ibrahim, who titled the press statement: ""President John Mahama's betrayal of Northerners - the case of your own brother killing you slowly"". They contended that though the NDC government under Mahama had made eradication of 'schools under trees' as one of its unprecedented achievements, there were still 22 Junior High Schools under trees in the Bawku West District of the Upper East Region. The present crises facing the National Health Insurance Scheme and the blatant untruth the President told the nation in his state of the nation address about a supposed 120-bed capacity hospital nearing completion in Garu were major issues raised under the health sector. The NPP therefore demanded unqualified apology from the President."973,Ghanaian Chronicle (Accra),12/3/2014,Bravo! the Church Accepts Responsibility for Corruption [opinion],,GHANA (97%),,,Newsletter,,ENGLISH,761 words,,24-Dec-14,,RELIGION (94%); CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY (93%); CORRUPTION (90%); CLERGY & RELIGIOUS (89%); PROTESTANTS & PROTESTANTISM (78%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (67%); INDICTMENTS (66%) Ghana; Religion; Corruption,"It had seemed this day would never come. For decades the church in Ghana had played the ostrich, merely issuing statements to condemn continuing incidences of corruption, but not bothering as to why the tendency among most Ghanaian is to be corrupt, given half the chance. Now the Christian Council of Ghana (CCG), the umbrella union of traditional churches in the country, has started asking the relevant questions. The CCG Chairman, the Most Reverend Professor Emmanuel Martey, has called on Christians to repent, because the responsibility for the pervasive corruption in the country can only be theirs, and no one else's. ""The Christian church is largely to blame for the country's current woes. ""The problem comes from those who describe themselves as religious people (Christians)... there are charlatans in the church; there are thieves in the church. ""The majority of the population (70%), which claims to be Christian - including all heads of state since independence - has failed the state. ""If Ghana is in the state in which we are now, do you tell me the less than 30% of non-Christians are responsible for that? It is not true!"" Professor Martey indicted on Joy FM's Super Morning Show on Monday. Most Rev (Prof) Martey, who doubles as the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana, blamed the modus operandi of some pastors outside the Christian Council for contributing to the corruption rot in the country. ""Some pastors are placing much emphasis on wealth through prophesies, which shouldn't be the case. Many of such prophesies are untrue. ""Since biblical times, we've had false prophesies and false prophets... Not all the churches in Ghana are of God... There are satanic churches in Ghana,"" he stated. On the way forward, the Christian Council boss prescribed the declaration of a state of mourning, during which most Ghanaians, particularly, the Christian faith who constitute about 70% of the nation's population, would repent their involvement in corruption. ""We need a sense of repentance... Now the message of corruption is being sung everywhere; let everybody hear it, and let us repent,"" he said. The Chronicle commends the Christian Council of Ghana for rising up to the occasion and admitting that corruption in the country is in its court. The prescription for repentance is all well and good, but it may well only scratch the surface of the problem. First, the satanic churches and their followers, if indeed they exist in the country, will ignore the call. Satan is totally beyond repentance. Congregations of the Christian Council will repent under the gaze of their reverend ministers, but the probability is that they would backslide in no time, as the tendency toward corruption is ingrained in them. We think the Christian Council needs to do more, like re-thinking about the pampering of the wealthy among its members, without bothering about their sources of wealth. That attitude to the rich pushes the have-nots to push, by hook and crook, to become rich. Though the orthodox churches do not preach that ""Jesus wore designer clothes"", the perception is that most of the elders in the orthodox churches are the bastion of corruption in the civil and public services. It is likely that if a census of all directors in the public sector - national, regional and district - were taken today, up to 70 percent of them, if not more, would be found to be elders and knights of the Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, Presbyterian, etc., churches. There are reports of district directors of education who have dozens of schools under them without teachers, but refuse to appoint teachers to those schools, just because the applicants are unable to pay the GH¢400 bribe they demand. The Chronicle also urges the church to begin emphasising the ""reaping and sowing"" aspect of the Gospel of Jesus Christ the Good Shepherd, especially, that the reaping could lead to eternal damnation. The church could also lead a crusade to re-think some the warped moral theories that underline traditional society and pre-dispose us all to corruption. It is time we rejected concepts as ""one eats where he works""; ""one does not stay by the river side and wash one's hands with spittle"" and the like. These are clear clarion calls not to tamper with national resources that come under one's care. So long as such axioms are inculcated from birth, and there is no clearly demonstrable enforcement that visits swift reprisals for corrupt acts, the fight against corruption will continue to be lost. The time for pontification is over. It is now time to get down to the brass tacks!"974,Ghanaian Chronicle (Accra),10/19/2014,Mind-Boggling Corruption - Is the Church a Promoter or Barrier?

With the manner in which it has been institutionalised at the NSS, all notes on corruption need to be revised for ghost names to be re-classified as the greatest waste pipe on the Consolidated Fund. And why not? GH¢7.9 million monthly, GH¢94,970,400 annually at only one of the over 500 ministries, departments and agencies of state? It may not happen to the same degree everywhere, but the incidence of ghost names must surely cut across the boards of state enterprises. The total rakings from all the traditional sources of corruption in the public sector that come from public funds - inflated contracts, kickbacks on construction contracts - pale into insignificance, compared to the proceeds from ghost names. Consequently, The Chronicle calls on all the multifarious anti-corruption Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), which, for the moment, at least, seem more interested in noise-making than taking concrete action to stem corruption, to re-focus their lenses on uprooting the canker of ghost names from the public service. Our indictment of the anti-corruption CSOs stems from their loud inaction over the illegal payments to Subah for no contractual work done. The Subah case stands out from most other public shenanigans: Whereas most often there is nothing really concrete for one to put one's figure on, here we have an admission by competent authority that indeed GH¢75 million was paid over three years to Subah, when it had not met the conditions precedent to merit such a payment. And yet, none of our CSOs could summon the courage to fire off a simple petition to ask the Commissioner for Human Rights and Administrative Justice to investigate. Pity! From where we sit that will remain a permanent blot on the vaunted anti-corruption credentials of the CSOs. The breaking of the NSS rot coincided with an appeal by CHRAJ to faith-based organsiations to help deter corruption. This was at a CHRAJ-organised engagement meeting in Bolgatanga that brought together pastors and leaders of the church, Muslim clerics and leaders of other faith-based institutions under theme of ""Building Broad Coalition for Combating Corruption and Enhancing Integrity in Ghana"", designed to encourage spiritual leaders to use the pulpit and other places of worship to educate and enhance the integrity of members and the public to fight corruption.. At the forum, CHRAJ Deputy Commissioner Richard Quayson said corruption, which had become part of everyday mannerism in Ghana, was of great concern to the Church and other religious bodies, therefore, there was an urgent need for those bodies to ""help chart a path against the canker."" That is a good move on the part of CHRAJ. But, regrettably, The Chronicle has some reservation whether the Church, as currently constituted, is a wholesome vessel for the fight against corruption. Rather, their posturing would seem to encourage corruption among their members. The radio and tele-evangelists among them preach mostly on prosperity, that encourages followers to ""sow seeds"" in tens of thousands of cedis and dollars, with the justification that ""Jesus wore designer clothes"". So they should also be able to afford designer clothes. Fine! But, are they also ready to die on the cross as Jesus Christ did? Nor do the traditional orthodox ones fare any better. Their front pews are reserved exclusively for the highest donors at harvests and other fundraising occasions. There is hardly any consideration as to the source of the funds that are so gleefully donated. If a census of the religious backgrounds of the 20 or so directors of the NSS arrested over the ghost names scandal were to be taken, it would most likely turn out that many, if not most of them, are elders of the orthodox churches. However, The Chronicle will admit that there are still religious leaders of integrity who do not put cash ahead of moral integrity, and we pray God to continually empower them to admonish their followers to thread the narrow and rough path to eternal salvation. To the glory of God Almighty. Amen!"975,Ghanaian Chronicle (Accra),7/10/2014,Anti-Corruption Toothy CHRAJ?

Last Thursday, July 4, 2014, it reportedly passed into law the National Anti-Corruption Action Plan. The NA-CAP had earlier been touted by no less a person than Justice Emile Short, pioneer chairman of the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice, as the antidote to our corruption woes. And Justice Short must know if anyone should! Among its virtues, the NA-CAP is said to have been designed to ""ensure efficiency, accountability and transparency in both public and private sectors, by investigating and prosecuting corrupt practices"". However, on July 8, 2014, less than a week after the NA-CAP was enacted, a ranking member of the Constitutional, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, Hon. Ben Abdallah has advocated that ""CHRAJ be given the mandate to prosecute cases of corruption that come before"". Contributing to the debate on CHRAJ's annual report for 2010, Abdallah (NPP, Offinso South), disclosed that CHRAJ received 38 cases of corruption in 2010, with three coming from whistleblowers. ""The cases included abuse of power/office, extortion of money and fraud. Out of the total number, misappropriation /embezzlement were 11, the highest"", he said. Abdallah emphasized that CHRAJ did not perform as expected in the area of corruption hence the committee's suggestion to it to consider ""partnering"" with such agencies as the Ghana Integrity Initiative, as a way of addressing the problem of lack of resources. Deputy Interior Minister, James Agalga, in his contribution said though CHRAJ has acquitted itself creditably over the years in its human rights and administrative functions, but it was too under resourced to fight corruption Agalga (NDC, Builsa North), therefore, reiterated the call for the adequate resourcing to ""fight corruption to the barest minimum"". The Chronicle wonders why Parliament would enact NA-CAP anti-corruption regime and four days later asked that CHRAJ be resourced to also fight corruption. Hello, is there a suggestion here that the MPs and other politicians do not particularly like the teeth NA-CAP has been endowed with? Are they too soft or too strong? It appears to us though that Justice Short would prefer the NA-CAP as Ghana's anti-corruption vanguard. And given his CHRAJ background and his involvement in the fashioning out of the NA-CAP, we back his preference. However, The Chronicle is unhappy with the ""secrecy"" in which NA-CAP has been shrouded and asks that the veil be lifted today without further delay. In our editorial of July 7, we urged Justice Short to kindly use his good offices to get the full text of the NA-CAP published, possibly on ghanaweb, so that all and sundry would be enabled to know what is it with the NA-CAP that gets him so excited it. We re-iterate the call today, in case we put it too poorly the last time. Such publication will facilitate the mustering of the necessary pressure on government to implement NA-CAP expeditiously, which he has called for. Justice Short, we wait!"976,Ghanaian Chronicle (Accra),7/7/2014,"Full Text of National Anti-Corruption Action Plan, Please? [editorial]",,GHANA (95%),,,Newsletter,,ENGLISH,523 words,,7-Jul-14,,CORRUPTION (95%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); HUMAN RIGHTS (78%); INTERVIEWS (78%) Ghana; Corruption,"The pioneer Chairman of the Commission for Human Rights and Administrative Justice, Justice Emile Short, has been going on and on about a National Anti-Corruption Action Plan, reportedly put together co-operatively about three years ago, as the panacea for the monster of corruption devouring Ghana. When he first broached the subject publicly about late last year, Justice Short pleaded with President John Dramani Mahama to the release the NA-CAP document, which was submitted to him while he was Vice-President, to enable Parliament enact it into law to boost the fight against corruption. Among the many virtues touted for it, it is said that the NA-CAP ""will mobilise efforts and resources of stakeholders to fight corruption."" ""It also aims to ensure efficiency, accountability and transparency in both public and private sectors, by investigating and prosecuting corrupt practices."" Now, Justice Short reports that Parliament, last Thursday, July 4, passed the NA-CAP Act. Apparently, President Mahama had heeded his entreaty, supported by one of our editorials, and forwarded the draft NA-CAP Bill to Parliament. In an interview with Citi News, reported on Ghanaweb, Justice short is quoted as having ""advised Parliament to implement the newly adopted plan. ""This is the first step, and the greatest challenge is the implementation of the plan. I think that we need to be hopeful and optimistic that the government will implement [it]. Mr. Short believes merely having a plan without implementing is of no use. According to him, the government will save more money if it takes immediate steps to implement the action plan. He, therefore, stated: ""We (Ghanaians) have to be hopeful and put pressure on the government to implement the plan."" Justice Short sounds so passionate in his belief that the NA-CAP is the proverbial Philosopher's Stone, or cure-all for our corruption pandemic. The Chronicle commends his unrelenting advocacy for a corruption-free Ghana, and wishes him more grease to his able elbows. However, we seem to note some sort of ambiguity. In one breath he advises Parliament to implement the anti-corruption act, and in the next, advocates pressure from all Ghanaians to get the government to implement the law. Which is which? Who has the responsibility under the law to implement the NA-CAP - Parliament or Government, or both? There is also the implication under its second aim that the operating arm or the Secretariat of the NA-CAP will be on auto-pilot in its investigative and prosecution activities, and possibly, in its financing. The wait-until-we-tell-you-to-move syndrome has been made a mess of by our on-the-make politicians, because of their parochial interests, and, in this day and age, any state institution with such a load on its neck is not worth celebrating. If the Secretariat of the NA-CAP is truly that independent, The Chronicle, The Spear of the Nation, will offer the NA-CAP Secretariat all the necessary support. But, please Justice Short, let us kindly have the full text and study it for ourselves. Such is necessary to gauge the sort of support we need to give the Secretariat. We await!"977,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),5/6/2015,Procurement Officers Should Shun Corruption,,ZAMBIA (90%),,,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,524 words,,7-May-15,,CORRUPTION (91%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (90%); BRIBERY (89%); PURCHASING & PROCUREMENT (89%); POWER PLANTS (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (77%); BEST PRACTICES (76%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (72%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (69%) Zambia; Corruption,"These works range from schools to hospitals, power plants to dams, office cleaning to construction of long stretches of roads. These expenditures take up huge public resources thereby creating ideal opportunities for corruption. TI indicates that from a public contract's overall value, on average 10 to 25 per cent may disappear into the pockets of corrupt individuals in a country. In short, it undermines and compromises the quality of works and services, which in turn becomes more costly and can lead to loss of lives. Anyone involved in procurement of public goods and services, as well as tenders for works on behalf of the Government is hence a critical player. We, therefore, want to echo the sentiments of the Zambia Institute of Purchasing and Supply (ZIPS) that the procurement officers in the country should desist from engaging in corrupt activities. As already alluded to the people who are involved in procurement are susceptible to being involved in corruption and, therefore, are part of the solution when it comes to curbing the vice. Buyers or procurement officers, especially those working in the public sector, usually find themselves in tempting situations because of the amounts involved in the transactions they oversee. Instead of succumbing to the temptation, they should be in the first line of whistle blowers who should help in combating against the cancerous scourge, which is a drain on public coffers. We agree with ZIPS president George Mumba that the procurement officers should strive to fight corruption in the sector, instead of being the drivers of the vice. The officers should resist the temptation of being bribed and help bring to book the vendors who are in the habit of offering these bribes. Further, the institute should also strive to ensure that its members do not engage in dubious dealing through continuous training on best practices in the profession. As trained professionals, apart from resisting bribery, procurement officers should be guiding other managers on good procurement practices. There are, currently so many cases, which are going on, resulting from failure by some Government officials in the country to adhere to laid-down procurement and tender procedures. Year in, year out, the Auditor General's reports reveal huge amounts of funds lost by the Government through public tenders and procurements. Some of these cases emanate from sheer failure to follow the procedures. If heeded to, the advice and guidance of the procurement officers on this matter would prove to be handy in curbing this seemingly rising trend. The cost of corruption in the procurement process is high as it adds to the cost of services to the public. Ultimately, corruption is a burden on the cost of doing business in a country. Leaving it unabated would be allowing individuals to enrich themselves at the expense of the quality of public works and services. Some people in corrupt countries have paid a terrible personal price for collapsed buildings as the result of the shoddy works perpetuated by this vice. Others have lost their lives through counterfeit medicines as the result of the corruption in the supply chain."978,The Times of Zambia (Ndola),4/18/2015,Nip Corruption in the Bud,,ZAMBIA (90%),,,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,590 words,,20-Apr-15,,CORRUPTION (92%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (89%); CIVIL SERVICES (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); TAXES & TAXATION (77%); ANNUAL REPORTS (76%); POLITICAL PARTIES (73%); POLITICS (73%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (72%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (68%); PURCHASING & PROCUREMENT (63%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (50%) Zambia; Corruption,"THE call by President Edgar Lungu for the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) to intensify the fight against graft is timely and must be adhered to. Corruption deprives ordinary people of basic services and undermines the country's development. It is, therefore, the duty of every Zambian to contribute to the fight against graft. ACC is at the moment dealing with 413 cases of suspected corruption received in the first quarter of this year alone albeit only 129 reports contained substances of graft. Corruption is not only unacceptable, it is a crime against development and the consequences are borne by marginalised people. But reports of corruption in the public and private sector are a growing concern even when it was expected that by now, the loopholes should have been sealed. There seems to be no 'immediate' action to the glaring financial irregularities revealed in the Auditor General's Annual reports published in the recent past few years, for instance. Punitive measures must be taken against erring officials including civil servants perpetuating the loss of public property, a scourge which is seemingly at an alarming level. This is one of the ways the public can have confidence that the tax payers' money is being put to good use. Government must put in place long lasting measures that will curb the abuse of public funds. The Government funded programmes such as the Social Cash Transfer Scheme, Youth Development Fund (YDF), Constituency Development Fund (CDF) are meant to benefit the people, but how are these funds monitored? Do the Ministries of Community Development, Local Government and Youth and Sport, have a monitoring system to ensure that the funds are used as intended? Concerns have also been raised about the fuel procurement process and the awarding of road contracts. Now is there a deliberate system to monitor the transparency in these processes? What about the employment processes where employers seek inducements? This is going on in our country and it must come to a stop as jobs should only be earned by merit. There is also need to step up the monitoring of how donor funding was being utilised particularly in community schools and health centres. Year on year donors are giving Zambia money and it is only appropriate that there is a strict monitoring measure of how these funds are being utilised. Our country cannot succeed in the fight against poverty if people continue to dip their fingers in public or private coffers and that is why the corruption must be put to a stop. Government should consider the establishment of a fast-track court on corruption to ensure that cases of graft are disposed off in good time. It is sad to note that corruption cases dating back many years ago under the Task Force on Corruption are still before the courts of law. There should also be a law in place compelling all political parties to state their source of funding for the sake of accountability. ACC should not be selective in how they handle cases of corruption. The Commission should effectively deal with complaints of graft to ensure transparency and accountability across all spheres of the Zambian community. ACC should decentralise its operations to other parts of the country and introduce their services in major local languages to encourage people to interact with the Commission. Government and every other stakeholder should enhance partnerships and ensure a firm approach so that anyone caught in the act of corruption is brought to book.

Mr Moono said this during the ACC first quarter media briefing for 2015 in Lusaka yesterday. He said that of the 129 cases, 60 were authorised for investigations, while 56 reports did not have sufficient details of the corruption offences to warrant investigations to be conducted. ""Currently, the commission has a total of 1,151 cases under investigation. The commission recorded 12 arrests around the country and 92 prosecution cases are before the courts of law.

Mr Moono reaffirmed the commission's commitment to the fight against corruption to ensure the country yields results that contribute to good governance and national development. The ACC also carried out investigations where the commission received 3 complaints of suspected electoral corruption that were unsubstantiated. Mr Moono said the ACC had monitored various campaign rallies and activities of political parties which participated in the January 20 election to ensure they adhered to the provisions of the law pertaining to electoral corruption. On the alleged corruption in the procurement of Oil, he said that the ACC was vigorously following up the matter to take note of allegations of corruption. He said that the Commission sat on various tender committees to ensure that guidelines were followed. ""The ACC acknowledged the allegations of the illegal procurement of oil as the country had a shortage and will take measures to tackle the issue. This was in public domain and we are following it up to ensure transparency and accountability,"" he said.

Transport, Works, Supply and Communication Minister Yamfwa Mukanga said the Patriotic Front (PF) Government was determined to fight corruption and hence it was important for ZIPS to join hands in fighting the scourge. Mr Mukanga said it was high time the procurement and supply professionals started defending the profession by ensuring that the established procedures and guidelines in the procurement process were followed. He was speaking in Livingstone at Zambezi Sun Hotel yesterday when he officially opened the third ZIPS annual national conference under the theme, 'Celebrating jubilee and focusing on the economic growth beyond the jubilee'. ""There will be no development without procurement and that is how important this procurement and supply profession is. ""Therefore, the mismanagement of this function has always had adverse effects in the economy such as increased costs for goods and services, misapplication of funds, mismanagement of funds, lack of transparency and accountability, wastage of materials and the list is endless,"" Mr Mukanga said. He said the quality of purchasing professionals must change through continuous professional training, capacity building and skills improvement. Mr Mukanga said despite an impressive economic growth averaging six per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per year, the country still needs to reduce poverty levels which are high especially in rural areas. ""We need to improve in agriculture and also tap into the mineral resources and place emphasis on enhancing growth and rural development,"" Mr Mukanga said. Speaking earlier, ZIPS President George Mumba said their role as supply chain management professionals was to support the Government in its pursuit of creating sustainable economic development.

Topics such as the UN Security Council issues, value for money in pursuing development results, preparations for the elections and democratic policies need frank dialogue. At the end of the dialogue you can agree to disagree, but still remain friends. Both the Netherlands and Uganda are preparing for elections. In the Netherlands these came about unexpectedly, due to a political crisis on the issue of the future of our participation in the peacekeeping mission in Afghanistan. On June 9, this year the Dutch electorate will cast their votes for the 150 Netherlands parliamentarians. Ninteen parties will contest in these elections. The Netherlands Embassy will function as one of the many polling stations. In line with the reciprocity principle, we will invite the Chairman of the Uganda Electoral Commission to send one or more observers to the vote tally on Wednesday June 9. In these elections the future of foreign policy and development cooperation is heavily contested. This will certainly impact on our presence in Uganda. One thing is clear in all political party manifesto's they all want to see a smaller and more efficient bureaucracy. The budget cuts in foreign relations will certainly affect embassies all over the world, including the one in Kampala. A second element is the clear left-right divide in the manifesto's on the future for development cooperation. The parties to the left of the political spectrum in the Netherlands want to maintain or increase the expenses for development co-operation. The parties to the right want to substantially decrease or even abolish development cooperation. So the outcome of the elections and the government formation will be very important for the future of the embassy in Kampala. Our presence in Uganda is mainly based on our development programme. Whatever government will be formed after these elections, one thing is clear, the number of countries that we are supporting at present almost 40, will be reduced. So I expect that by the end of this year, the list of partner countries will be reconstituted and Uganda will have to make it's case to be included on that list. For Uganda to succeed in the competition for funds, there will be a need to show improved performance on a number of indicators: like on achieving the Millennium Development Goals, on fighting corruption, on improving governance, rule of law and protection of human rights, and on the importance accorded to poverty reduction. Also Uganda is preparing for elections in February 2011. This will provide Uganda with an opportunity to prove pessimists ( and if you read the newspaper there are a lot of pessimists around ) wrong.

The most high profile case was when Thomas Mulondo, the LC5 chairman of Kayunga, who was thrown out of his seat, three years ago regained it after the IGG lost interest according to a statement from the IGG's Office. A week later, former Lubaga North MP, Ken Lukyamuzi, also won a petition against the IGG. Court said he had been relieved of his duties wrongly. Other unclear cases included those of Beswale Kezaala, the Jinja mayor and Mohamed Kanakulya, an education officer in Kamuli district, who also won the case against the IGG. He was accused of using about sh1.9m, allocated for his fuel on personal businesses and employing a driver who had failed interviews which caused the district financial losses. However, Mulondo maintained that these were politically motivated cases that the IGG should have investigated more before arresting him. He says having fallen out with many political leaders and civil servants in the district, including then chief administrative officer (CAO) Maira Mukasa, he became the IGG's target. For the last few years, the IGG has led to the arrest of over 40 local leaders across the country. According to the report of January to June 2008, 133 cases were reported from districts by whistle blowers, comprising 14.5% of total cases. Cases of municipalities, which are also local governments accounted for 6.8%. In the 2009 report, local governments, were mentioned as the leading corrupt institutions in the country again, with 20% of the reports received. In the same report, Kampala had 149 complaints, Masaka 40, while Kabarole had 32. ""The complaints were forwarded by many sources including district leaders and other whistle blowers,"" the IGG, Raphael Baku said. However, these cases rarely go through the courts of law. In most cases, the IGG recommends a course of action. In Mulondo's case, the recommendation was that he vacates office, a decision which was overturned in court. Local leaders argue that most of the cases the IGG handles have political motivation and lack substantial evidence that can see them through the courts. They cite the Mulondo and Kezaala cases as examples. And at the end of the day, it is the Government at loss as the acquitted local leader has to be paid In recent years, the only case involving local leaders that the IGG successfully prosecuted was against MP Herbert Sabila. In Mulondo's case, he is supposed to be paid all his salary and allowances which is about sh72m for the three years that he has not been in office. Lukyamuzi may be paid over sh90m, for which he was not even representing people in Parliament. Leaders lose trust in IGG During a recent retreat of IGG and local leaders from the Lango region at Lira Hotel in March, Lira mayor Peter Owiny, accused the IGG of being partisan and unable to fight corruption. ""We support the IGG's fight against corruption, however, our argument is that some of the reported cases are politically motivated,"" said Iganga district chairman, Asuman Kyafu. They argue that although there is corruption among local leaders, most of the cases brought up are politically motivated. When Mulondo was arrested and physically molested three years ago, local politicians in the district predicted that the arrest was just another chapter in a power struggle whose dimensions change everyday. ""These problems result from politicians who have failed to respect their boundaries,"" says Muwanga Kisaalita, then secretary for finance and administration, and councillor for Kayunga Town Council. He was later charged with Mulondo, but has since been acquitted. Just like Kezaala said during his trial, the IGG office should look beyond the mentioned cases. Local leaders argue that if the IGG worked closely with them, the results of these cases would be less embarrassing. Uganda Local Government Association (ULGA) ethics and accountability committee deputy secretary, Rose Gamwera, says the IGG should work closely with the Accountability and Ethical Code of Conduct Committee of local leaders if it is to have a headway in fighting corruption in local governments. Local leaders say the whistle blowers who the IGG depends on for information may lack the right data about a particular corruption case. ""We are all committed to fighting corruption, however, it is important that the masses are given the right information about budgeting and accountability issues. Otherwise, most of the cases might be based on wrong premises and hearsay, which is why when the said corrupt local leaders are taken to court, none of the cases succeeds,"" explained Peter Ogwang, Speaker of Dokolo district and member of the ULGA Ethics and Accountability Committee. In various reports, the IGG argues that the office is still challenged with limited man-power to effectively investigate cases and powers to see the prosecution of corruption cases through. However, the Government seemed to have answered this by introducing the anti-corruption court that recently started hearing cases. Previously, corruption cases were heard in ordinary courts.

The report, which was released yesterday, however, shows an overall fall in reported crime cases from 119,000 to 103,000. The number of corruption cases went up to 95 last year, up from 46 the previous year. This does not include the cases being investigated by the IGG. According to Police boss Kale Kayihura, there was an increase in the number of cases involving NAADS funds, local government funds and land fraud. ""Given the pervasiveness of corruption, this number is too low. Few people bother to report to the Police for action,"" Kale explained. He said he had ordered Police officers all over the country to aggressively fight corruption. ""We should not always wait for the President to unearth these cases for us to follow them up,"" the Police boss noted, adding that there was also need to wipe out corruption within the Police. Ritual murders increased to 29 cases last year, up from 25 cases in 2008. Kale, however, said, most of the people reported as missing had been found. Of the reported crime cases last year, about one third were taken to court and of these, a quarter led to convictions. Over 22,000 cases were still pending, bringing the total case backlog to 40,000. Theft was the leading crime in Uganda last year, with over 27,000 cases registered; followed by assaults (17,000) and economic crimes (11,000). Property worth sh167b was lost and less than 10% of that was recovered. Sex-related offenses on the other went down considerably, from 12,000 in 2008 to about 7,000 last year. Rape cases were 619 compared to 1,536 in the previous year. A total of 165 guns and 580 ammunition were recovered from criminals, higher than in 2008. The number of deaths in accidents continues to rise. Over 2,700 people were killed in road accidents last year, as opposed to 2,300 in 2007. No figures for 2008 were made available. Kampala continues to top the list of crime cases, with over 28,000, followed by eastern Uganda. Within Kampala, Katwe, Kawempe, Old Kampala and Kabalagala have the highest crime rates."986,New Vision (Kampala),3/22/2010,Govt Lacks Will to Fight Corruption,,"UGANDA (94%); EASTERN AFRICA (94%); KENYA (93%); RWANDA (92%); BURUNDI (92%); TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF (92%); AFRICA (92%)",,,Newspaper,Taddeo Bwambale,ENGLISH,393  words,,23-Mar-10,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (92%)",CORRUPTION (95%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (77%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (69%); FREEDOM OF PRESS (63%) Uganda; Crime and Corruption,"Lack of a political will remains the biggest challenge to the fight against corruption in East Africa, the head of a regional anti-corruption body has said. Tito Rutaremara, the president of the East African Association of the Anti-Corruptioní¢- Authorities, said many leaders have stepped up campaigns against corruption, yet the efforts have not been adopted at lower levels of governance. ""Sometimes, the political will to fight corruption is only at the top and it does not trickle down to the bottom. We have good laws but without political will at the lowest levels, it is difficult to fight the vice,"" he said. Rutaremara was speaking on Friday in Kampala at a meeting of heads of anti-corruption agencies from Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi. Formed in September 2007, the body brings together five anti-corruption agencies. They include the Inspectorate of Government of Uganda, Special Brigade Anti-Corruption of Burundi, Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission, Office of the Ombudsman of Rwandaí¢-  and the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau of the United Republic of Tanzania. Rutaremara, who is also the chief ombudsman of Rwanda, appealed for funding from the governments of the member states to help the body buy modern equipment and recruit more technocrats. He urged the public to desist from tendencies of corruption, saying lack of awareness about corruption and its associated dangers was the reason some people have accepted the vice as noble. Rutaremara said the regional body will sensitise the public about corruption and provide joint training programmes for investigators and prosecutors of anti-corruption agencies to handle high profile cases in the region. The deputy director of the Kenya Anti-corruption Coalition, Dr John Mutonyi, warned against laws that criminalise the media, adding that it will affect the fight against corruption. ""Corruption is normally secretive and people only get to know about the vice through the media. Laws should not curtail media freedom because it is one of the conduits for information about corruption,"" he said. Uganda's Inspector General of Government Raphael Baku said the regional body will ensure that money stolen from one country is not spent in a neighbouring country. He said member states will cooperate in investigating, prosecuting and tracing the proceeds of corruption."987,New Vision (Kampala),3/14/2010,Corruption Ingrained in Ugandan Culture [opinion],,UGANDA (94%),,,Newspaper,Moses Ssebugwawo,ENGLISH,564  words,,15-Mar-10,,CORRUPTION (92%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (90%); CORPORATE WRONGDOING (89%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (77%); INTERVIEWS (76%); PURCHASING & PROCUREMENT (73%); PRICE INCREASES (50%) Uganda,"In the recent weeks, the press has been carrying stories of how the Public Procurement Body has stepped in to stop the acquisition by the Inspectorate of Government (IGG)of a sh9b office complex located in Kamwokya. The reason given for halting the deal was that there were flaws in the procurement process. The Parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has also been busy exposing those involved in dubious CHOGM deals. Unfortunately, this is only a tip of the iceberg and many questioned deals within our Government departments remain under wraps. The Government's fight against corruption reminds me of a dog chasing its tail, round and round and round. The honest answer is that corruption will never be eliminated unless the hunters walk the talk. Would these hunters pass the test in John 8:7, ""Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her"". My answer is a big NO. Even at the height of President Museveni's massive anti-corruption campaign, we are still witnessing wastage of public funds under the eagle eyes of PAC and the IGG. Indeed, the efforts of these bodies are unlikely to have any significant impact in the fight against corruption unless severe reprimand and action is taken on the culprits. The public wants to see the President ""cracking the whip"" at those at fault. Unless this happens, anti-corruption activists like myself will not be convinced that enough is being done though none will dispute that we have gone beyond the days when the accuser would be asked to produce the evidence. The bad news is that our culture has in-built corruption, judging from the many creative ways in which 'thank-you' may be said. Ugandans tend to be very grateful and it is touching that obviously limited resources notwithstanding, they still feel able to give. They like to show appreciation, which in my view is totally okay. However (and I insist), we must know where gifts end and bribes begin. What we see today are bribes, bribes and bribes. So with the Government at risk of losing the moral high ground, it is high time that the wounded but armed hunter goes into overdrive, tightens the noose further and be seen to bite. I recently listened to an interview of David F. Meyer, the former financial controller at WorldCom. I am sure many of you recall vividly the Enron/WorldCom scandals in 2002. In the interview, Meyers confesses to using shady accounting methods to mask WorldCom's declining financial condition by falsely professing financial growth and profitability to increase the price of WorldCom's stock. Meyer agrees that when pressure is applied to a human being, one never knows what the outcome will be. It is this pressure that the corruption hunter must address first. The greed, the low pay, extravagant lifestyles, mention it. Having lived through President Museveni's 24 years at the helm and watched his demeanour for a while now, my conclusion is that the man is probably more dangerous than he appears. When he talks, it is as if he can't hurt a fly. But I have seen a few people like that whose soft exterior often belies a steely inner resolve. I have a strong belief that corruption can be fought and sooner than later the hunted may well be running for cover without mercy from his excellency. Hopefully.

This behaviour is universal for instance: The former US president declared that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq while the whole aim was to attack Iraq in order to rob oil from there. The US capitalist class is occupying Guantanamo, a territory of Cuba. The US capitalist class has turned Israel into a US client, extended territory, and springboard in order to dominate and administer the Middle East by (a) occupying Golan Heights, a territory of Syria, (b) occupying Gaza, (C) occupying Salem, all territories of Palestinians with an overall purpose of robbing oil in the region. The US is an ally of Saudi Arabia which is never elected and then talks about surveillance of Uganda's elections of 2011 to see whether NRM is fit to continue in power. The same US overthrew Dr. Allende of Chile who was broadly and fairly elected by the Communist Party of Chile when John Kennedy declared: ""We prefer a capitalist dictatorship to a communist democracy."" He was overthrown by CIA with 16 bullets shot in his mouth. Saharawi (Spanish Sahara) was a colony of Spain. It fought a guerrilla war against Spain since 1965 and won in 1975. Morocco never took part in fighting for the liberation of Saharawi, but immediately Saharawi became independent of Spain, Morocco declared it was its territory. East Timor was a Portuguese territory. It fought on its own to become independent from 1965 to 1975. The minute it became independent, Indonesia declared it its territory, without having contributed anything during the struggle against Portuguese colonisation. John Kennedy all along tried to assassinate the entire cabinet of Cuba through the CIA after victory over Batista, only to find that the Communist Party of Cuba was so well-grounded that destroying that particular cabinet, an exact and similar one would spontaneously arise with a similar line of the necessary social continuity. Patrice Lumumba of Congo, 1960, won broadly with his Congolese National Movement against Belgian colonialism. But Gelvin, a highly placed CIA officer in Congo was ordered by the CIA authority to provide Lumumba with toothpaste which contained poison to kill. Eventually Lumumba was killed through Belgian, French and US CIA collaboration and intrigue. Dr. Jagan of Guyana with a pro-peopIe party with a majority on the ground was undermined by John Kennedy who collaborated with Dr. Bernard to undermine a majority party. Why? Dr. Jagan hated American imperialism in Latin America while Bernard did not mind and was an ally. Guyana being a territory growing and possessing a lot of sugarcane, many black people who were working in sugar plantations were bribed by the US to support Bernard against Dr. Jagan, an Indian, on racial grounds and in favour of US imperialism. When Nelson Mandela declared that arranging South Africa under apartheid as a social system was not correct, he was imprisoned by the South African government and put on Robben Island for 27 years. His name was put on the US list of terrorists for action. It was only in May 2008 that his name was cancelled from the terrorist list. Many civil servants in Uganda are being charged for using money which is intended for public service. These civil servants are not elected by the population. They have contracts under which they work. This means whichever party wins an election will have to work with them. The only problem is that some of the civil servants are not spiritually clean. They are just like hyenas, wolves, jackals or vampires. This is the same problem the world is having with an economic arrangement like imperialism. Everyone is born in the same way like the other on a geographical item called land. But there are those who grab big chunks of land, claiming they have more power and rights above all others, which is morally ugly and uncouth. There happens to be someone who declares that he or she wants to head a government on the basis of the type of family descent which was above many other people before the present ones. That person claims that he or she has that as a right and that subjecting such a person to an election is violation of human rights, abuse of status, disrespect and corrupting the nature of the institution of his or her ancestry. Jesus Christ was against the Pharisees who were the rich Jewish class despising the poor. He was also against the Saducees who were collaborating with Roman colonisers of Judea. All these hated him. They finally decided to get rid of him. They passed through the treasurer of his disciples, Judas Iscariot. They gave him 30 pieces of silver, captured Jesus and killed him. Corruption should be understood as a universally negative social phenomenon whereby people are privately unable to know objectively what they are supposed to do, for what purpose and how. The socio-economic arrangement of the globe by the US imperialist treatment of various territories of Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East is not correct. Imperialism is not a correct method of work for humanity. The money lent to heads of state of various countries has strings attached, in the sense that those heads of state often yield and succumb to the economic desires of those lending them. In the end, the heads of state and the lenders will be allies above the people of the territory, for which the money is meant to be used on. So those heads of state become agents of imperialism. These territories now become neo-colonies. The answer, therefore, can only be patriotism on the part of the civil servants, heads of state in all organs of state apparatuses all over the world. There is also the need for cadres to raise the level of social consciousness so as to form revolutionary pro-people parties. The education ministries all over the world should pay attention to the faculty of ethics geared towards realising the need for the welfare of all human beings. People should oppose capitalism as the benchmark of civilisation with all its higher stages of continuity, namely imperialism and neo-colonialism.

Even civilisations, have undergone, owing to the sheer weight of corruption. - Rome - so powerful, so vibrant, yet so soft in the moral centre. The collapse of the Roman Empire was caused mainly by corruption in the leadership, many have argued. In Corruption and the Decline of Rome (1988), Ramsay MacMullen, a leading historian, argues that the collapse was caused by economic conflict between the upper and lower classes of the empire. - The Soviet Union - nuclear super power, puppet master of the Eastern Bloc, champion of social equality, but ultimately the real life playing out of Orwell's Animal Farm. - Some have postulated that the ""coming collapse of America as we know it"" will be the consequence of corporate greed and corruption. Snippets of it have been evident in the last three years, with inherent economic weaknesses in the US plunging the world into recession. Which way, Uganda? The choices are stark - either go the way of integrity in governance, or enjoy the short-term benefits of degenerate governance and social existence, while slowly but surely knotting the rope by which the country will hang itself. Corruption, with all its facets - moral, financial probity, political accountability, personal discipline, social consciousness - manifests itself fairly strongly in just about every aspect of Ugandan life. Quite apart from the usual suspects - the managers of (financial and material) resources - the custodians of public trust like politicians, the Church, educators, civic leaders and civil servants, as well as family heads, and even primary school children aspiring for class monitor, have fallen foul of the false allure of corruption. And how about the private individual who will not pay her taxes, or let alone the car owner who will not respect traffic rules? When they compiled the Uganda Country Report http://www.nepaduganda.or.ug/documents/CountryReviewReport-Uganda.zip, the Africa Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) noted that corruption was cross-cutting (that is a broad) problem shooting across the four areas of concern, of democracy and political governance, economic governance and management, socio-economic development and corporate governance. But what, then, is the way forward? Speaking in Kampala at a public lecture by Sundulos Africa Leadership Training last July, Ghanaian Prof Stephen Adei, an authority on governance in Africa, told Ugandans that ""a country without think tank capacity is like a human being without a brain."" Think-tank is the way to go. APRM has taken our governance issues to public discourse, in the form of the Uganda Governance Forum, where stakeholders openly discuss the day's concern and plot a way forward. The Governance Forum debate on corruption, under the theme 'Enhancing the Effectiveness of the Legal and Institutional Framework for Combating Corruption in Uganda', last month drew a diverse crowd that included the Principal Judge, the Inspector General of Government (IGG), the ethics minister, legislators, academics, church leaders, politicos and politicians of all hue and colour, students and activists, and business leaders. The IGG set the tone from the outset by emphasising that corruption needs honest discussion at all levels. The consensus is that Uganda has enough, and some even think, a surfeit, of anti-corruption laws. Witness the Constitution itself, the Prevention of Corruption Act, the Police Act, the Leadership Code, the IGG Act 2002, the Local Government Act, the Access to Information Act, among others. We could probably get the Whistleblowers Bill and a Witness Protection Bill coming through the legislative processes. So, it is not for the lack of legislation and, as the Principal Judge puts it, ""we should not rely only on the law."" We must, as the ethics minister says, cut out ""the hypocrisy, double standards and lip-service"" that has thus far characterised the anti-corruption drive. Legalism can only help so much, but we should, as well, look at the moral and other extra-judicial approaches. Noting a less-than-zealous willingness to tackle corruption, the think tank has the following recommendations: - Leadership Code - the public service should ensure that public servants declare wealth at the start of service and monitor it consistently; expand wealth declaration beyond the current pool of public leaders - Institutions - the Executive must act on recommendations of commissions of inquiry; Parliament must debate and act on Auditor General and IGG annual reports; check actual cost of services and products - Morals - faith groups must emphasise moral education; moral aptitude tests be part of recruitment policy - Judiciary - the Judiciary's role is not to fight corruption. There is a need to look beyond prima facie (first sight) evidence; get more judges and magistrates to tackle backlog; consider confiscating/recovering wealth/stolen loot of the corrupt. As Uganda seeks to transform, the Governance Forum will sit monthly, making its contribution to what management scientist J.P. Kotter calls ""a guiding coalition, a coalition which at the national level is a think tank"". Corruption has had its day for much too long. It is too late for the Romans, and the Soviets are but a footnote in history. Where does Uganda want to be?

Of particular interest was the sh600m aviation and weather radar equipment that was supposed to be installed specifically for CHOGM. Not only was the system delivered three days into CHOGM - meaning it did not serve its initial purpose, but in addition the ""brand new"" radar is no longer in operation having broken down last year. The officials said they did not have the capacity to get it up and running again prompting the question, wasn't there a warranty on the equipment? The PAC chairman Nandala Mafabi suggested the suppliers should refund the money and the procurement officials be penalised for buying junk and be charged with abuse of office. The incompetence of our civil servants would not be comical were it not for the fact that this country does not have enough drugs and personnel in health centres. And it totally ceases to be funny when, on closer scrutiny, this bungled contract can only point to less charitable motives on the officials part. Hopefully that will be for the courts to decide. Corruption has become so pervasive the fear is that when history is written it will be the enduring legacy of this generation. Corruption is frustrating the delivery of services, which in turn is making it impossible for the majority of Ugandans to partake of the world renowned economic growth this country is famous for. Eventually the beneficiaries of corruption subvert democracy perpetuating a vicious cycle of poverty. Time is running out for Ugandans. Either we deal with this cancer now or let the generations that come after us grovel under the heels of an oppressive minority hell bent on sustaining the status quo in order to continue feeding at the trough."991,New Vision (Kampala),2/2/2010,NGO Proposes Use of Research to Fight Corruption,,UGANDA (90%),,,Newspaper,Darious Magala,ENGLISH,196  words,,10-Feb-10,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (90%)",CORRUPTION (97%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (90%); PHARMACEUTICALS INDUSTRY (88%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); CLERGY & RELIGIOUS (68%); FORENSICS (66%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (66%); HOTELS & MOTELS (53%) Uganda; NGOs and Civil Society,"There is need to carry out necessary research into corruption as one way of fighting it, the executive director of African Anti-corruption and Drug Research Initiative, Aggrey Kwikiriza, has said.

""Corruption is not an ordinary crime. It is complex, sophisticated and they are now stealing using cyber. It is a white-collar crime, which calls for a change of the law and a highly trained and sophisticated Judiciary,"" Ogoola said yesterday. He said it is high time Uganda emulated Ireland, which has shifted the burden of proof from the prosecution to the accused in cases of corruption. Ogoola made the remarks at the second Uganda Governance Forum in Kampala. It was organised by the African Peer Review Mechanism and the Inspectorate of Government. Baku concurred that corruption cases are difficult to handle, especially when judges demand proof beyond reasonable doubt, 'and reasonable doubt depends on a particular judge handling the case'. With syndicate corruption where mafia-like gangs are involved, the burden of proof must shift to the accused and not the prosecution, he noted. Baku explained that: ""When you come across a syndicate corruption case you can arrest the entire group like what we did in Makindye division and Bundibugyo. Unfortunately, because all of them are under arrest, you cannot get someone to give evidence."" Ogoola also commented that the creation of new districts was detrimental to the Judiciary because there are only 30 chief magistrates in the country yet each district should have one. ""With only one magistrate handling a million Ugandans, can justice be seen to be done? I am not against the creation of districts, but we must look at service delivery."" Ethics minister Nsaba Buturo said corruption had become a cancer which should not be politicised. He said people should work together to fight the vice. The minister, however, was criticised by the participants, especially legislators, who accused the Government and President Yoweri Museveni of defending officials implicated in corruption because they are either historicals, fought in the guerrilla war or are staunch NRM members.

Besigye said the National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS) officials were being punished, while government officials, who have stolen colossal sums of money, remain free. ""Billions of shillings are being stolen by big officials in ministries, but the Government is harassing the sub-county leaders who are receiving a smaller part of the money. This Government has no will to develop the poor,"" he said. ""The World Bank report of 2009 said that the country is losing about sh500b to corruption each year. But I know it is more than this because we know of a lot of money which has been stolen that the World Bank doesn't know about."" Besigye added that ministers move around the country telling people that their welfare has improved, yet most of them are living in abject poverty. He said the money used for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in 2007 would have been used to build about 8,000 schools. ""There is no government which has stolen money like this one (NRM). The sh400b, which was spent in three days on CHOGM, can be used to build 8,000 schools."" Besigye was addressing residents of Nyantozi trading centre in Masindi district. The residents had earlier complained of widespread poverty and unemployment. Besigye is campaigning to become the FDC flag-bearer during the 2011 presidential polls. Besigye, who started his campaign for the party presidency in Bulisa district last Sunday, is battling with Maj. Gen. Mugisha Muntu for the position. He also attacked the Electoral Commission (EC), saying it should be disbanded before the 2011 elections. Besigye, who has lost twice to President Yoweri Museveni in 2001 and 2006, said the EC is a rubber-stamp of the NRM and should be replaced with an impartial team. Speaking at another rally at Ikoba trading centre, Besigye said ministers wanted the Government to buy them new vehicles worth sh200m each.

Ethics and integrity minister Dr. James Nsaba Buturo blamed the continued theft of public funds on the lack of patriotism and fear by the public to report corrupt officials. ""Corruption is a major threat to our way of life and the corrupt don't realise that they are sowing seeds of self-destruction,"" Buturo said. He noted that the welfare of Ugandans would be better if the corrupt were not draining public funds. ""Lack of patriotism is why the stealing is rampant because people don't love their country and don't care about others,"" Buturo said. ""Poverty would not be as big and as intense if the rampant stealing of public funds was not going on,"" he observed. The minister made the remarks while addressing the media about preparations for the 24th NRA/NRM day anniversary due on January 26. The festivities, to be held under the theme, ""24 years of NRM governance; so much done so much to do"" , will be held at Maluku district grounds in Mbale district. On January 26, 1986, the then National Resistance Army (NRA) guerrillas took power, after five years of a protracted war in the Luweero triangle, which installed the NRM government. The NRA's ascendance to power ended years of dictatorship and anarchy. Buturo listed the NRM gains in the last two decades as the creation of a strong economy, boosting security, rapid expansion of social services, protection of Uganda's sovereignty, establishment of a responsible and responsive army, constitutionalism and the rule of law, affirmative action and improved communication. ""We have made progress, but my God, one big challenge is we need to protect achievements,"" he cautioned. As the country embarks on campaigns ahead of the general elections slated for February 2011, Buturo warned politicians from both the opposition and the Government to desist from ""bad politics"". He said the responsibility of holding free and fair elections lies with both the Government and the opposition. ""It would be wrong to oppose everything that the Government does because you are in the opposition. You lie and work with enemies of the country... that's the bad politics I am talking about,"" the minister said. He called on the public to avoid confrontation with the Police. ""It never happens anywhere that a civilian slaps a policeman. It happens in primitive society and the media gives it coverage. There you are, that's our standard,"" Buturo said."995,New Vision (Kampala),1/20/2010,District Leaders Deny Corruption Allegations,,UGANDA (96%),,,Newspaper,Joshua Kato,ENGLISH,900  words,,10-Feb-10,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (90%)",CORRUPTION (91%); WAGES & SALARIES (89%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (89%); SCHOOL DISTRICTS (78%); BRIBERY (77%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (76%); INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRUCTION (76%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (76%); WHISTLEBLOWERS (72%); BUDGETS (68%); TEACHER COMPENSATION (65%) Uganda; Crime and Corruption,"FOR the umpteenth time, the Inspector General of Government (IGG)'s report revealed that the Local Government (made up of districts) is the most corrupt institution in Uganda, with Kampala district taking the lead. According to the report, corruption in the District Service Commissions (DSCs) is so high that jobs are bought and District Contractors Committees (DCCs) must be bribed for contracts to do work for the district. According to the IGG report, 20% of all complaints received were against district administration. In terms of complaints, Kampala topped with 149 complaints, Masaka had 40 complaints, Kabarole had 32. According the IGG Rapheal Baku, the conclusion that districts are the most corrupt institutions was reached because they had the highest number of complaints. Baku said complaints came from district leaders themselves and other whistle blowers. The districts receive funds from the central government every year. In the last two financial years, they received a total of sh2.5 trillion. In addition, they have internally generated revenue. However, the report says most of this money is not accounted for. This money is spent on education, health care, roads and water. ""They talk about giving us money in trillions, but they do not say that over 90% of that money pays workers' salaries,"" says the Masaka district LC5 chairman, Vincent Ssempijja. For most districts, education constitutes over 60% of the entire district budget. Nearly all the money pays teachers' salaries rather than adding quantity or infrastructure to the schools. On the other hand, however, the district leaders think the so-called corruption is largely over exaggerated. ""Yes there is some corruption, but it is not as much as the report portrays it,"" they argue. Local leaders add that the easiest way to determine corruption is to identify shoddy work. For example, somebody may see a classroom constructed by a district and claim it is shoddy because it is not as good as the one constructed by the central government. ""But this person may not know that in costing the classroom construction, districts must pay about sh33m for two classrooms, while the central government pays sh75m for the same two classes. ""There is definately a difference,"" says Asuman Kyafu, the LC5 chairman, Iganga. With roads, Kyafu says, while districts are supposed to pay not more than sh10m to 15m per kilometre of road, the central government pays sh25m for the same distance. At the end of the day, the roads the central government works on are better than the roads the district works on. To a villager, the fact that the district road is not as good as a central government road means that the district 'ate' some of the money. For instance, Masaka was given over sh400m to work on roads. The work mainly involves grading and applying a layer of murram on the road. The district has over 2,000km of roads that need repair. Since the cost of working on these is about sh10m and 15m, the sh400m budgeted for roads can only work on less than 300km. ""When somebody says we had sh400m for roads without telling the people that we needed over sh2b to do a good job, then they are telling half the story,"" Ssempijja says. We asked some district leaders for their views on the allegations of corruption. While many leaders may not like being mentioned among those who are corrupt, I do not see a problem. Our mandate is to fight corruption in our districts and other institutions. I often ask people to report cases of corruption that they suspect so that they can be investigated and dealt with. We are definitely not the most corrupt institution. I want to make it clear that all the money that is sent to the local governments is conditioned or attached to a certain exercise. There may be some corruption in procurement, but that cannot qualify districts as the most corrupt institutions. It is okay to fight corruption and we concur with the IGG on that. However, the IGG should be more vigilant on the ground in the districts than entirely relying on whistle blowers, because they do not get all the details. The IGG's report is positive criticism for local governments to be vigilant in issues of accountability. However, as members of ULGA, we still question the IGG on issues of objectivity. Specific information concerning corruption should be given. Reporting cases is one thing and proving them is another. We encourage the IGG to partner with us in fighting corruption by sensitising people about being accountable. We are all committed to fighting corruption. People must be given the right information about budgeting and accountability. Some cases might be based on hearsay, which is why when the said corrupt personnel are taken to court, very few of the cases succeed. I do not agree with the findings. Many other institutions are more corrupt. How can you say that because an institution had the highest number of complaints, then it has to be the most corrupt? Kampala receives more coverage and hence more complaints.That does not make them more corrupt. We concur with the findings of the IGG report. However, there are several factors that must be proved. The IGG did not take the trouble to explain why some districts like Masaka had 40 complaints while others like Budaka had no complaint at all. Masaka was covered more by the media and other sources, which does not mean that there was no case of corruption in Budaka."996,New Vision (Kampala),1/18/2010,Fight Corruption in the Land Registry [opinion],,UGANDA (91%),,,Newspaper,Eseza Byakika,ENGLISH,558  words,,10-Feb-10,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (53%)",CORRUPTION (91%); DEEDS & RECORDINGS (90%); REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (89%); AGREEMENTS (74%); INVESTIGATIONS (70%) Uganda; Land Issues; Crime and Corruption,"The President, in his New Year message, stated that 2010 is a year of zero-tolerance to corruption. The land registration department should be priority. The corruption in the Land Registry is a tragedy to our country! My father passed away in 1997 and left us properties which he acquired way back in 1969. However, last year, I discovered that one Winfred Najjuko had obtained a certificate of title to our land located on Block 14, Plot 401, at Kibuga in Najjanankumbi. I quickly approached the Land Registry and found that a special instrument of transfer had been issued to Najjuko. There was also a sale agreement purportedly signed by my late father in 2008. Imagine the dead signing! I was told to produce the original title, according to my claim, which I did. To my dismay, one of the commissioners responded to me in a letter, saying she noted that a special certificate of title had been issued for the above land under instrument KLA 381352 of July 10, 2008. Subsequently, a transfer was effected to Najjuuko under instrument KLA23938 of 28/07/2009. Unfortunately, she indicated that she had failed to trace the said instruments from the register and, therefore, in the circumstances, she could not authenticate my claim of the transfer and the title being fraudulent. She advised me to pursue other means, to lay my claim. In a system where individuals are supposed to be held accountable for their actions and performance, how could the commissioner fail to ask the responsible officers to trace the instruments of transfer? This calls for serious disciplinary action and immediate investigations. A transfer done in July 2008 and getting lost in November 2009 would raise lots of questions, but this seemed normal business to the commissioner. Later, the commissioner wrote a letter to Najjuko requesting her to avail the special certificate of title and a copy of the transfer upon which she was registered as the proprietor. Fellow Ugandans, are we safe with the custodian of our precious assets like certificates of title of land? Many helpless people have fallen victim to this mismanagement in the land registration department and have lost their properties. Are we allowing this dirt to continue? Isn't the above case among the many that have proved beyond reasonable doubt that the employees in that department are not performing their duties and should face disciplinary action or be dismissed? Why is it difficult to discipline these employees in the land registration department? What is keeping them there with all the stories about them? The lasting solution to this department is a total overhaul of the employees and systems. We have professionals in this country capable of designing unique systems that can capture certificates of titles and eliminate possibilities of fraud or mismanagement. We also have professional managers who can improve the conduct of the employees in that department. If the President was serious about eliminating corruption in this country, he should start with the Land Registry. I am willing to provide free professional assistance. Land is a valuable asset worldwide. It should be managed in a more transparent, fair and accountable manner by the people in the responsible offices. Only that can make Uganda a better country.

Members of the National Assembly will during a plenary sitting of the ongoing November 2011 ordinary session, examine and adopt the bill to authorise the President of the Republic to ratify the African Union Convention on preventing and combating corruption. The Vice Prime Minister, Minister of Justice and Keeper of the Seals, Amadou Ali defended the bill in the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly, Saturday, November 12. The convention adopted in Maputo, Mozambique on July 11, 2003, entered into force on August 5, 2005. Government in the explanatory statement of the bill specifies that it seeks to promote and strengthen the development of mechanisms required to combat corruption and related offences in the public and private sectors; facilitate cooperation among State parties to ensure the effectiveness of measures and actions against corruption; and finally to establish the necessary conditions to foster transparency and accountability in the management of public affairs. Sectors covered by the convention, are acts of corruption among persons, influence peddling, illicit enrichment, diversion of property by public officials, money laundering and illegal receipt of property. The convention that is comprised of 28 articles, ""highlights the requirement for public officials to declare their assets, as well as the need to restrict immunities granted to public officials, the need to give the media access to information and the protection of informants and witnesses in cases of corruption and related offences,"" government explains. Article 6 of the convention makes provisions for the confiscation and seizure of proceeds and instrumentalities of corruption"". It further specifies that State parties undertake to adopt all necessary legislative measures to reinforce control measures and strengthen national anti-corruption agencies and accountability systems. The bill on the convention is timely as the Head of State, Paul Biya during his ruling Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM) in September 2011 in Yaounde, campaign messages and inaugural speech at the National Assembly after taking the oath of office on November 3, 2011, expressed government's resolve to eradicate the corruption scourge. The African Union convention to a large extent reflects Cameroon's laws and regulations, particularly Article 6 of the Constitution, the law relating to the funding of political parties and the decree to establish the National Anti-corruption Commission (NACC)."999,Cameroon Tribune (Yaoundí©),11/11/2010,Fight Against Corruption - Britain Pledges More Support,,CAMEROON (94%); UNITED KINGDOM (94%); EUROPE (92%); AFRICA (92%); ASIA (79%),,,Newspaper,Victorine Biy,ENGLISH,304  words,,12-Nov-10,,CORRUPTION (92%); EMERGING MARKETS (90%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (90%); INTERGOVERNMENTAL TALKS (78%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (73%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (72%) Cameroon; Crime and Corruption; Europe and Africa; Governance,"The British High Commissioner to Cameroon, Bharat Joshi revealed this yesterday after meeting with the Minister Delegate at the Presidency in Charge of Supreme State Audit.

In line with what the country has been doing for the past years, Joshi Bharat in an audience with the Minister Delegate at the Presidency in Charge of State Audit, said the need to help Cameroon improve its financial management procedures in tackling corruption is primordial. He said the aim is not only to strengthen the crusade against corruption in the country, but to ensure that tax payers' money is judiciously put to use. This, he added, is geared at moving the economy and country forward. The High Commissioner noted with satisfaction efforts being made by government to put a halt to the canker worm that is holding back economic growth. He said the syndrome is not only common to Cameroon, but to the whole continent. He was however hopeful that efforts in reducing, and why not eradicate, the ill remain on track. ""Where corruption is being tackled, there is fast economic growth and Africa in 30 years will outstrip Europe and Asia, the most vibrant economic powers on the planet,"" he underlined.

The headquarters of the transparency International-Cameroon in Yaounde was the venue of the official launching of the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) 2010. The event saw the participation of members of the diplomatic corps, journalists as well as guests. The 2010 CPI measures the degree to which public sector corruption is perceived to exist in 178 countries around the world. The 2010 CPI shows that nearly three quarters of the 178 countries in the index score below five on a scale from 0 (perceived to be highly corrupt) to 10 (perceived to have low levels of corruption), indicating a serious corruption problem. The 2010 results are drawn from 13 surveys and assessments published between January 2009 and September 2010. In the CPI, Denmark, New Zealand and Singapore tie for the first place with scores of 9.3. Unstable governments often with a legacy of conflict continue to dominate the bottom rungs of the CPI. Afghanistan and Myanmar share the second to the last place with a score of 1.4 with Somalia coming in last with a score of 1.1. Botswana, the first sub-Saharan African country comes at the 33rd position with a score of 5.8, followed by the Mauritius Islands at the 39th position with a score of 5.4 and Cape Verde at the 45th position with a score of 5.1. The rest of the 30 African countries considered in this ranking are below average. Cameroon and Cote d'Ivoire share the last position with a score of 2.2. The 2010 CPI covers two countries fewer than last year's edition. The slight change resulted from individual sources adjusting the range of countries they asses. This adjustment in coverage made it possible to include Kosovo for the first time but led to the exclusion of St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Suriname for which only two sources of information where available this year. Where source surveys for individual countries remain the same, and where there is corroboration by more than half of those sources real changes in perceptions can be ascertained. Using this criteria it is possible to establish an improvement in scores from 2009 to 2010 for Bhutan, Chile, Ecuador, FYR Macedonia, Gambia, Haiti, Jamaica, Kuwait and Qatar. Similarly, a decline in scores from 2009 to 2010 can be identified for the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Madagascar, Niger and the United States."1001,Cameroon Tribune (Yaoundí©),10/21/2010,Anti-corruption Fight - National Strategy Goes Operational in 2011,,CAMEROON (94%); CENTRAL AFRICA (79%); AFRICA (79%),,,Newspaper,Emmanuel Kendemeh,ENGLISH,491  words,,21-Oct-10,"YAOUNDE, CAMEROON (94%)",CORRUPTION (93%); BUDGETS (89%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (78%); TREASURY DEPARTMENTS (77%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (77%); EMERGING MARKETS (73%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (73%); TAXES & TAXATION (73%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (72%); PRIME MINISTERS (72%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (71%); BUSINESS CLIMATE & CONDITIONS (68%) Cameroon; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"Cameroon's maiden National Strategy for the Fight Against Corruption was validated in Yaounde on Thursday October 21.

He also announced the imminent creation of a rapid intervention anti-corruption unit that will be expected to appear promptly on the scene of complaint to act. During his presentation, he explained that since June 16, 2010, NACC has been working with its technical partner, Change Habits Oppose Corruption, CHOC, to set up the national strategy to fight corruption that will establish a clear and common vision as well as harmony in the fight against corruption. ""The methodology chosen by NACC required the organisation of sector-by-sector workshops and meetings to strengthen the pillars of integrity as an approach for the formulation of the national strategy for the fight against corruption in Cameroon,"" said the Vice-President of NACC. He revealed that 10 sectors of activity and six pillars of integrity were chosen as priority based on some work that had been done by NACC in the past and the perception of corruption by experts. Laying emphasis on a participative sector-by-sector programming of its activities, workshops had been organised in 2009 with the transport, education, media and the business sectors. He further explained that since June 16, 2010, NACC and the CHOC project have organised workshops in five sectors: health, forest and environment; public investment budget and public contracts; education as well as public finances. Four more workshops will be organised to target sectors like transports, decentralisation, the business climate as well as mining and extractive industries. As for the strengthening of pillars of integrity, workshops were recently organised for the civil society and the media. Four more workshops will also be organised to target the following sectors: the legislative system; the judiciary system and institutions fighting corruption; technical and financial partners and lastly the executive system. In all, 16 more workshops will be organised before September 4, 2010 so that the final document could be ready before September 24, 2010. He justified the sector-by-sector workshops approach on the need to know the manifestations of corruption in the different sectors of national life so as to ensure a more efficient fight. The conclusions of the workshop will be transmitted to the concerned ministries for appropriation, modification or eventual enrichment so as to produce a sector-by-sector strategy that will be realistic not bureaucratic. The Vice President of NACC also expressed joy that the population were mobilised wherever NACC passed and the participants in the different workshops showed satisfaction and felt proud that they too were associated. NACC officials also used yesterday's press briefing to present some of NACC's achievements in the areas of investigation, prevention and cooperation.

The government of Cameroon plans to undertake a reformed, broad based and multi-sector anti-corruption drive that revolves on denunciation of all aspects of corruption, information and education. The National Anti-corruption Commission (NACC) that gathers reports from all bodies in the country involved in fighting against the corruption scourge has already launched a vast programme that targets 10 sectors that deal with education, communication and transport. The Vice Chairperson of NACC, Dieudonní© Massi Gams in a press conference in Yaounde on June 16 disclosed that investigations were going on in several ministries whose results will be exploited in the broad-based anti-corruption strategy. The Prime Minister, Head of Government, Philemon Yang, hours before the NACC press conference chaired the third Steering Committee meeting of Change Habits, Oppose Corruption (CHOC) Project during which its Coordinator presented the project on the reconfiguration of the ministerial anti-corruption units. CHOC Project brings together members of government, heads of diplomatic missions, representatives of the World Bank, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), National Governance Programme, private sector and civil society representatives. Ministries constitute the hub of corruption in the country. It was for this reason that the government set up ministerial anti-corruption units to tackle the canker warm in all sectors. The ministerial anti-corruption units function under the coordination of the ministers who authorise investigation teams to go to the field and the results of their investigation are forwarded to him. The chairperson of the Anti-corruption Unit in the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Decentralisation (MINATD), Aboubakari Oumarou, Technical Adviser in the ministry said in a chat with Cameroon Tribune that the unit is composed of nine members. Five of the members including the chairperson are senior officials of the ministry who range from technical advisers to directors and inspectors. Four other members are selected from the civil society. As to how the anti-corruption unit functions, Mr Aboubakari said they meet on a quarterly basis. He disclosed that when users of services, partners, administration and the general public report alleged cases of corruption, the unit members inform the minister. The minister after examining the allegations may authorise the unit members to carry out field investigations. The findings of the investigation team are forwarded to the minister for proper action and another report sent to the National Anti-corruption Commission. The chairman of the Anti-corruption Unit in MINATD, said they have investigated alleged cases of fraud in many parts of the country, especially in councils. The desired impact in most of the cases, he said, is achieved considering that their actions are dissuasive. As with all ministerial anti-corruption units, Aboubakari Oumarou, said their role is limited to investigating cases of alleged corruption, report to the minister who takes the final decision. The members, he added, cannot take any repressive action. The anti-corruption machine is usually slow, the units toothless bold dogs, the work of the unit hardly perceptible to the general public. Corruption is still deep rooted in most ministries and public institutions despite the existence of anti-corruption units therein. This necessitates urgent reforms of the ministerial anti-corruption units as the harmonised national plan of action piloted by NACC starts off."1007,Cameroon Tribune (Yaoundí©),4/12/2010,Corruption Virus,,CAMEROON (94%),,,Newspaper,Eldickson Agbortogo,ENGLISH,179  words,,12-Apr-10,,CORRUPTION (91%); BRIBERY (78%); CHILDREN (75%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (75%); PRIMARY SCHOOLS (75%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (75%) Cameroon; Crime and Corruption,"It is no more a secret that the fight against corruption is on.

A may be the recent FENASSCO B games can serve as an example. This is because it is unbelievable that in a local competition like the primary school games corruption should be at the forefront. Those actively involved in the mal-practice are not the innocent pupils, but the teachers who accompany the children to the games. At the eve of the event, they start by fabricating fake school licences for non pupils of the school. During the games, they do all to make sure their teams emerge victorious. Any obstacle, they go bribing match officials or members of the homologation committee. At the end, medals are awarded to unmerited pupils and no new talent discovered. ..The million dollar question in every lips is If they can carry out these type of practices in public events what of marks during exams?...

The conference room of the Yaounde Hilton hotel was the venue of the formal launching of the book titled ""Board Member's Corporate Government Handbook: Corporations and enterprises of the Public and Quasi-public sector of Cameroon"" by Professor Cosmas Cheka. In the ""handbook"" the author targets board members and managers of state corporations, advisers and collaborators with the identification and selection of those who are appointed by the authority to sit on the boards of State corporations, municipal councillors of the 374 local councils and of Cameroon's future regional councillors, the Cameroonian tax payer who is indeed the owner of all Cameroon's State corporations and librarians, students and the general public interested in questions of good governance and accountability. The ""handbook"" is written with a number of objectives such as to provide members of a framework of shared values and principles of good corporate governance that could enhance the checking of corporate misconduct for better performance, revive consumer and investor confidence in State corporations, contribute in enhancing the quality of oversight exercised by boards of State enterprises in the complex 21st century corporate world and present a guide to advisers charged with the selection of those who sit on the boards of State corporations. The handbook has five chapters. Chapter one circumscribes the importance and principles on which corporate governance is founded. In chapter two the powers of the Board are outlined and explained in relation to recent jurisprudence. Chapter three deals with rights and obligations, cornerstone of the integrity of the Board as well as of the rule of law. Chapter four outlines aspects of the rules governing the relationship between the board and the executive of State corporations. The last chapter is entirely dedicated to activities touching on the control of management and of the general life of the corporation by the board. Issues treated in this chapter concern essential tips for preparation and participation in board meetings and how to interpret a balance sheet. Earlier, the Minister Delegate in charge of Supreme State Control Seigfried Etame Massoma called on board members of State Corporations to make good use of the ""handbook"". The Board member's Corporate Handbook has 143 pages. It is written in French and English. The book is sold in all the book stands in town and it costs FCFA 6,000."1009,Cameroon Tribune (Yaoundí©),2/19/2010,APF Proposes Preventive Action Against Corruption,,CAMEROON (94%),,,Newspaper,Emmanuel Kendemeh,ENGLISH,418  words,,19-Feb-10,"YAOUNDE, CAMEROON (79%)",CORRUPTION (94%); EMBEZZLEMENT (92%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); LARCENY & THEFT (90%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (90%); TALKS & MEETINGS (89%); POLITICAL PARTIES (89%); POLITICS (89%); POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS (84%); ELECTIONS (78%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (78%); HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS (73%); INTERVIEWS (72%); GUILTY PLEAS (72%); AMNESTY (71%); CREDIT CARDS (70%); JAIL SENTENCING (67%); SENTENCING (67%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (50%) Cameroon; Crime and Corruption,"The Alliance of Progressive Forces (APF) wants the Head of State to bring to book all corrupt officials. One of Cameroon's opposition parties, the Alliance of Progressive Forces (APF), has called on President Paul Biya to spare no corrupt managers and embezzlers of public funds in the ongoing anti-corruption crusade and to above all recover all the stolen funds and property. The National President of the APF, Barrister Bernard Muna during the party's second National Council meeting in Yaounde recently proposed that government should settle public bills using treasury pay vouchers and transactions abroad be made using electronic credit cards as a way of curbing corruption. ""The involvement of ministers in the payment of bills with liquid money is archaic"", Barrister Bernard Muna said. ""The most important thing will be to negotiate for the repatriation of the stolen money stocked abroad"", Mr Muna stated, wondering whether it would not be possible to envisage a total cancellation or reduction of prison sentences of the embezzlers of public funds who have pleaded guilty, accepted to pay back the money and publicly asked for forgiveness. The APF leader proposed a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a forum within which the amnesty on repented embezzlers and corrupt officials could be negotiated and safe guards put forbidding them from all positions of responsibility. The Head of State, Bernard Muna said could also put in place a legal and diplomatic mechanism with the mission to negotiate with State and foreign banks where the country's stolen wealth is stocked for it to be repatriated and invested in a special programme for the fight against poverty. Barrister Bernard Muna in an interview said Cameroon needed patriotic and honest leaders who are full of integrity for the country's prosperity. He reiterated his party's commitment to the unity of Cameroon but said the unity is threatened by the uneven distribution of the country's wealth throughout the 10 Regions. Supporters of the Alliance of Progressive Forces used the second National Council meeting to evaluate the party's activities and adopt the road map for the year just starting. Barrister Bernard Muna said APF was created on March 25, 2007 when five political parties merged and stated that it was now made up of seven political parties. The urgent mission of the APF, he disclosed, was to rally more political parties to choose a credible and acceptable candidate to oust President Biya in the 2011 presidential election."1010,Cameroon Tribune (Yaoundí©),2/3/2010,Communication Minister Mobilises Against Corruption,,CAMEROON (95%),,,Newspaper,Emmanuel Kendemeh,ENGLISH,799  words,,10-Feb-10,"YAOUNDE, CAMEROON (92%)",CORRUPTION (97%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (90%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (90%); EMBEZZLEMENT (89%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (89%); CRIMINAL LAW (85%); TREASURY DEPARTMENTS (73%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (73%); LAWYERS (69%); POLICE FORCES (63%); PRESS CONFERENCES (57%) Cameroon; Crime and Corruption,"Issa Tchiroma Bakary says the fight against corruption is permanent. Cameroon's Minister of Communication, Issa Tchiroma Bakary has said the ongoing fight against corruption will continue till the country is purged of corruption and public wealth protected for the general interest. Issa Tchiroma in a press conference in Yaounde yesterday, February 02 explained what the executive and judiciary arms of government were doing to fight against corruption. Operation Sparrow Hawk selective In answering the question on whether the current arrest and trail of corruption suspects known as ""Operation Sparrow Hawk"" was not selective, the Communication Minister said the fight against corruption was permanent and that no corrupt manager of public funds could escape the dragnet of the anti-corruption drive. Mr Tchiroma said President Paul Biya who is accountable to the Cameroonian people started the fight against corruption as far back as 1982 when he acceded to the Supreme magistracy. He noticed the deviant behaviour of some managers and came out with ""Rigour and Moralisation"" as a guide. Government, the minister said, knows where it is going with regard to the fight against corruption and the Head of State has the timing for every file at the level of the executive. Nobody can force the Head of State against his timing and once the executive arm of government finishes its own part in the anti-corruption fight, the judiciary which is independent takes over. Humiliation of suspects The Minister of Communication also answered another question that stated that the way Operation Sparrow Hawk is carried out leaves many people to believe that the suspect is already condemned. He said justice is the same for all and there is the presumption of innocence. Police officials sent to arrest people for interrogation are not instructed to humiliate them as the dignity of the suspects should be protected. Mr Tchiroma also said nobody is brought before the law courts without his or her lawyer. The protection of the citizens, the Communication boss stated, is the responsibility of the Head of State, adding that as far the anti-corruption fight was concerned nobody could dictate to either the executive or judiciary arms of government what to do and the time because there is separation of powers. Paying back the embezzled funds Issa Tchiroma was also questioned on the preference of many Cameroonians that embezzled funds be paid back instead of imprisoning the corruption officials. He said Cameroon's Penal Code allows for negotiations between the suspected embezzler and the judiciary for the money to be paid back into the State treasury, further stating that the suspects have lawyers who master the Penal Code. The minister disclosed that as at now, nobody has openly declared the readiness to negotiate. The property of some corruption officials was confiscated by the courts. In this connection, Mr Tchiroma said the property was just a tip of the iceberg of the public wealth embezzled and said government was diligently investigating where the stolen wealth was stocked. The process, he said, was delicate but government will spare no effort in going right to the end. Law on declaration of assets The Head of State, the communication minister said, was gradually applying Article 66 of the Constitution which provides for a certain category of State officials to declare their assets and property when entering and leaving office. Journalists said the inexistence of a text of application to the law was encouraging corruption. According to Issa Tchiroma, the law was not imposed on the Head of State, stating that he is applying the law through anti-corruption institutions such as units in ministries, Supreme State Audit Office, National Anti-corruption Commission, National Programme on Governance and other independent institutions. The institutions check the ostentatious living conditions of some managers of State funds. The minister concluded that Article 66 of the Constitution is producing the desired results. Anti-corruption to eliminate political rivals The Minister of Communication singling out the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM), President Biya's party and commented on statements that the Head of State was using the anti-corruption fight to eliminate his rivals within the party in the next presidential election. Issa Tchiroma said the CPDM constitution provides that the party's candidate in a presidential election is its national chairman. Since the party has only one chairman, the arrest, trial and jailing of corrupt officials, some of whom happen to be CPDM militants, cannot be considered as a means by the Head of State to eliminate his rivals. He said honest militants could still gather money not from public funds to contest for elections."1011,The Monitor (Kampala),12/31/2011,Minister Hits Out At Govt On Corruption,,UGANDA (94%),,,Newspaper,Moses Walubiri,ENGLISH,274 words,,3-Jan-12,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (92%)",IMMIGRATION (94%); ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); IDENTITY SECURITY (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (78%); PASSPORTS & VISAS (77%); NATIONAL IDENTITY CARDS (77%); CITIZENSHIP (72%); TERRITORIAL & NATIONAL BORDERS (71%) Uganda; Corruption; Governance,"A minister has decried ""theft and profligacy in government"" which are constraining a number of initiatives, including stopping illegal immigrations into the country. The State minister for Planning, also Buyanja County MP, Mr Matia Kasaija, was responding to queries about the operationalisation of dual citizenship by the Ugandans in Diaspora in Kampala yesterday. Mr Kasaija said theft from public coffers besides porous borders was responsible for the increasing cases of illegal immigrants. ""If we did something about the theft and wastage of resources in government, we would be able to channel the much-needed resources into ventures that can transform this country,"" he said. The minister cast doubts over the effectiveness of the national identity cards project in weeding out illegal immigrants due to graft. ""Even IDs won't be able to solve this problem because leaders at local councils routinely recommend aliens for our passports for a pittance. To solve this problem requires collaboration of all stakeholders."" In October, the minister of Internal Affairs, Mr Hilary Onek, said government was committed to ridding the country of illegal immigrants in a period of six months. Mr Onek said unlike other countries, foreigners had come to deem Uganda as a country of ""free entry and exit"" due to the laxity of its immigration policy. He said unplanned for people were hamstringing government plans by putting pressure on the country's limited resources. The Internal Affairs minister also hoped that the problem would be solved by the issuance of computerised identity cards which would come in handy in keeping proper data of bonafide Ugandans."1012,The Monitor (Kampala),12/29/2011,Prayers Over Corruption Sound Rather Hollow [column],,UGANDA (94%); UNITED STATES (79%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%),,,Newspaper,Karoli Ssemogerere,ENGLISH,846 words,,29-Dec-11,,CORRUPTION (92%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY (88%); RELIGION (85%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); TAXES & TAXATION (78%); OFFSHORE OIL & GAS EXPLORATION & EXTRACTION (77%); OIL & GAS INCENTIVES (76%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (75%); DISMISSALS (75%); INDICTMENTS (74%); EVIDENCE (74%); AGENCY ADJUDICATION (73%); OIL EXPLORATION (71%); OIL & GAS EXPLORATION (71%); ACQUITTAL (67%); POLICE FORCES (63%); CATHOLICS & CATHOLICISM (62%) Uganda; Corruption,"Many breadwinners will earn some much-needed pause in their spending strings after the year's most expensive holiday. Some deadbeats like government failed to make payroll despite Public Service Minister Henry Muganwa Kajura's reassurances to Parliament. In 2011, for a few moments it seemed the waters of the Red Sea would part with a significant body blow against corruption and graft in government. This was not to be. The year of the oil debate which, for once, startled the executive ended inconclusively. It is unlikely that the MPs will ever get the ""actual"" cooperation they need from sovereign governments to substantiate the allegations they made on the floor of the House. In fact, it may end in a scenario where they are reprimanded for publishing false and misleading information. The fight against corruption also left Uganda's important development partners tarnished. The United States and the United Kingdom refused to come to Parliament's rescue to aid in ""oil-gate"". An interesting legal fight has been going on between administrative tribunals and courts in Uganda and those overseas. Parliament has at least succeeded in halting-- for now-- the ""farm-down"" transaction allowing Tullow Oil to sell part of its oil exploration block holding(s) to the Chinese and Total on the basis of an expired license. Across town in Kololo; the anti-Corruption Court became a location for photo-ops. The much hyped trials of former Vice President Gilbert Bukenya and Motorcare ended with dismissals on the basis of insufficient evidence to sustain the charges requiring the Vice President to go on his defence. 48 pages of taxpayer-published indictments went to the bin after government officials exonerated the former Vice President and Motorcare from any wrongdoing in the case. Catholics, and other Christians alike, must have wondered whether the Crucifix has become the new symbol of those accused of graft. Margaret Bukenya's joy at her husband's acquittal was marked with prayers to the heavens. There are many questions that intelligentsia who run this country have failed to answer. Why so much poverty and need in an atmosphere of abundance. Why do motorists; and road users have to subsidise wages to a bloated police force on their roads and public places acting like a sort of tax and expect the country to be secure? Why do we spend so much time praying over corruption as a cancer that is threatening the fabric of society when the same people leading these prayers are consorting with thieves? Sometimes, Uganda's so called economic miracle is inflated beyond its size like a trial balloon. More than half of Uganda's administrative sub-divisions-- the sub-counties-- are more than 25-30km from a functioning hospital. Similar numbers are removed from a Class C road linking inter-district headquarters. In fact, while Kampala continues to labour under choking population growth, many parts of the upcountry are dying a slow death from a dearth of services. Centres of progress like schools, churches and trading centres in many parts of the country remain in a state of stunted growth. So does the absence of meaningful employment opportunities outside Kampala and a spattering of smaller urban centres along Uganda's major transport arteries. The government's priorities today seem to be somewhere between maintaining a large political class: the fastest and surest way to riches and moderating independent drivers of economic growth in the country. How else could an interest rate regime attempting to collect 35-40 per cent interest rate from small businesses that employ the majority of Ugandans on existing loan facilities be described in any other way other than economic sabotage? Larger economies led by the United States have been in a swift and steady path of economic decline triggered by a lending apocalypses also known as sub-prime lending: How else would smart people at the IMF allow Uganda, in necessary belt tightening, to use the most destructive tools- interest rate manipulation and defaulting on its domestic obligations to fight inflation without attacking the core political problem of expansive government and wasteful government expenditure. In 2011; we, of course, saw the worst of this trifecta- the senior IMF representative traveling to Kyankwanzi, a moribund educational institution that is a key tool used to maintain government's political patronage. We saw crocodile tears and protestations of innocence tagged to a transaction where the taxpayer lost millions of dollars. We saw a disenchanted Judge- Paul Mugamba Akiiki, bellow out a hoarse note; ""Cry the Beloved Country"" after seeing the IGG literally fold his tail in a dangerous game of political survival. Of course the winners were over at the Central Bank- the check of 1.7 trillion to buy fighter jets of questionable relevance cleared; so did Basajja's 100th check on the basis of comfort letters written by the Governor. Don't ask why public service pay, healthcare and education suffered!

According to well documented World Bank statistics, Uganda loses an estimated Shs500 billion per year to corruption. And yet yearly, Ugandans continue to die because of the effects of corruption - in the form of poor service delivery. In May, the media reported that Middy Acen and Eunice Acola had died in Lira Regional Referral Hospital due to a severe blood crisis that had hit the medical facility. In August, Sylvia Nalubowa died in Mityana Hospital from complications of an obstructed labour as the hospital lacked a doctor to carry out a caesarean operation that could have saved her life. Another mother, Jennifer Anguko, also died in Arua Regional Referral Hospital in December 2010 due to a uterus rupture following 15 hours of obstructed labour. There were deaths of more mothers like Cecilia Namboozo who could not be attended to at Mbale Referral Hospital because she could not afford about Shs300,000- more than her monthly teachers' salary. While the NRM government has demonstrated its intention to fight corruption, through its rich anti corruption legal framework, the issue of political will remains a matter of serious concern. The government deserves credit for such laws as the Anti Corruption Act, 2009, the Public Finance and Accountability Act, 2003, the Budget Act, 2002, the Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Act, 2003, The Access to Information Act, 2005, The Whistleblowers Act, 2010 and the Penal Code Act Cap 120. In addition, the government has also established institutions such as the Inspectorate of Government, the Anti Corruption Court, and the Ministry of Ethics and Integrity to lead the graft fight. However, the same government has remained dead silent as its top lieutenants continue to dominate the list of officials suspected of involvement in huge corruption scandals. In addition, key government institutions and agencies have perennially topped the list of the most corrupt institutions, including the Police, Judiciary and district local governments. Uganda is also a signatory to the UN Convention against corruption and ratified the AU Anti- Corruption Convention but ironically is one of the top corrupt countries. As Parliament Speaker Rebecca Kadaga recently said, corruption has reached a crisis level. A recent Transparency International Index on corruption ranked Uganda among the most corrupt nations in the world - and second worst in East Africa! Government efforts towards elimination of corruption must include a policy to improve salaries of government workers. The Police and teaching remain the least paid professions. Is it therefore a surprise that such institutions like the Police perennially top the list of the most corrupt agencies? The government faces an uphill task defending its leadership failures as it superintended over one of the most corrupt countries in the world.

Since the advent of the NRM, the government, ably and transparently led by President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni has publicly campaigned against the scourge of HIV/Aids. For decades the impact and results of the government's commitment and determination have resulted in excellent dividends for everyone to see and admire. The Uganda's stand and fight against this terrible disease has been acknowledged worldwide. As a result of our excellent record on HIV/Aids, money from the Global Fund was generously donated to Uganda to help our government and people continue fighting against this incurable disease and others. Alas, those who kindly extended the hand of assistance from the Global Fund did not know at the time that government cadres and others were also suffering from another terrible disease called corruption. A lot of money donated to fight HIV/Aids and malaria disappeared into private pockets or unauthorised projects. Under NRM, the Ten Points Programme of recovery, principled, transparent and people's government, the Movement leadership, revealed good and popular policies to be embraced by the whole population in the quest for good governance. At the time, even the most severe critics of the NRM were quite impressed by its ambitious and achievable programme of national recovery, development and good governance. The projected goals of governance were; broadbased administration, transparency, and elimination of corruption, abuse of office and the principle of individual merit as a basis for election or appointment to public office. As if by design and deliberate acts, these ideals and objectives were ignored, then opposed by the NRM itself and ultimately declared to be the enemies of its leadership and supporters. The principle of broadbasedness gave way to fanatical support even if it was devoid of merit. Former allies of the ruling oligarchy who had genuine political and developmental differences were branded the enemies of the ruling party and the wretched of the earth. In order to continue in power and office perpetually, NRM leaders embraced capitalism in preference to socialism that they had passionately advocated for before. Patriotic intellectuals and peasants who reminded the NRM party of its previous stand and promises they came to power with and now deliberately ignoring or violating, were condemned as traitors and renegades. Corruption which in Uganda sustains politicians in positions of power became the acceptable norm. We do not know of any country, let alone one claiming to be fighting against corruption where a president reveals that a citizen forged documents to swindle the country and the forgers remain at large, with the police, the IGG and the DPP staring in space and doing nothing to protect the name and reputation of the President. Few citizens or few countries hear officials accusing a leader of being the ringleader of dishonest deals and the leader vehemently denies participation in the crime but officials insist it was the President who committed those offences and no one lifts a finger in the defence of the President except a columnist in a newspaper. The same officials do not offer their resignation and the police and other investigating agencies remain conspicuously silent. What reputation or honour of that leader can remain untainted for the population to admire? Has anyone heard of a political system where government sets up commissions and internal probes to investigate wrong-doing and when crimes and other offences are publicly discovered and reported with names of wrong-doers revealed and it is recommended that the culprits be indicted, investigated, must be prosecuted and punished, then everything is turned upside down so that the commissioners and investigators are placed in the dock or they constitute part of the Cabinet agenda for discussion and possible punishment. Have you ever heard of a Cabinet minister who is closely associated with suspects of crime, who orders the return of property to suspects knowing that the subject matter of her fancy is not only the subject of a court trial but the same minister had been implicated in shoddy deals involving the same property? Do our leaders no longer respect the law or know what is sub-judice, or the Leadership Code or ethics at all? You may wish to read the findings and recommendations of the commission of inquiry into Tourism. How can an official commit offences in an institution he or she heads and when a legally constituted body finds that certain government employees who were previously accused of wrong-doing were actually innocent and the accusers are the ones who have cases to answer but a minister refuses to reinstate the innocent and protects the guilty. Ultimately, citizens know that unless something is done, the system of governance which permits all the above contradictions to operate side by side will ultimately be condemned and doomed. If you doubt this prophesy, take a sampling of all the present system's cadres, both low and high, they will tell you that they are equally not happy with what is going on to-day. Should you have eavesdroppers in Cabinet and other Government fora and listen to their views in the hearing of the party leaders and their support machine, you will certainly doubt your sanity or theirs. Some African leaders declared themselves Presidents for life, others decided to squander national wealth or compromise national interests in all efforts to cling to power or to accumulate personal wealth beyond the dreams of fellow compatriots and often at the expense of the latter.

Mr Nyakaana was replaced by Ms Florence Kadoma Kanyunyuzi, the Bukuuku Sub-county woman councillor. Mr Nyakaana could not be contacted as all his known phones could not go through and he has not attended two council meetings.

(Matthew 1.21) The name 'Jesus' literally means ""The Lord saves."" The world into which Jesus was born was not a good place. His Jewish people did not have their own country; they were living under an oppressive, colonial government. Their Roman overlords were corrupt, harsh, and recruited other Jews to extort money from them through outrageously high taxes. Zaccheus was one of those Jewish tax collectors the Romans recruited. He stole a lot of money from his people in order to make himself rich at their expense. There was a lot of idolatry in the occupying government and among the colonialists. They burned incense to the Roman King, and even sacrificed children to other gods. There was also a lot of immorality in the world into which Jesus was born. There was financial corruption. People engaged in sexual immorality and did many sinful things to satisfy their sexual appetites. They had many sexual relations and then had abortions to kill the children conceived by those unions. There was also homosexual practice, and widows and orphans were abandoned and left to fend for themselves. The world into which Jesus was born was not a nice place. And, yet, it sounds a lot like our Uganda of today - except that we have our own independence and freedom. We no longer have colonial overlords. Instead, our corruption means one Ugandan is stealing from another Ugandan. We are doing these things to ourselves. The Uganda of today faces many of the same challenges as the world into which Jesus was born: Corruption has reached epic proportions; There has been a resurgence of idolatry, witchcraft, and human sacrifice; Sexual immorality is killing our people; Greed and selfishness are rampant and leave many people, especially widows and orphans, in helpless states. And, yet, at this time of the year, we celebrate and remember the birth of a unique baby - one called Jesus because ""he will save people from their sins."" As we come to the close of 2011 and prepare to enter 2012, there is still hope for our Uganda because Jesus' name still means ""he will save people from their sins."" There is still hope for our families and our country...because Jesus is still the Saviour of the world. Our government is very important to the proper order and functioning of our country, but the government is not the Saviour. Only Jesus is the Saviour, because his name still means ""he will save people from their sins."" The best our government can do - the IGG, the Anti-Corruption Court, laws passed by Parliament and enforced by our police and other agencies - is to give us moral and civil speed governors, external rules that are followed by us only because the police force or parliamentary investigative committees have been expanded to put fear into our hearts and ensure our compliance and proper behavior. But, God said through the Prophet Jeremiah in the Old Testament, ""The time is coming when I will make a new covenant...It will not be like the covenant I made with their forefathers....This is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel...I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts."" In other words, my fellow Ugandans, we must acknowledge that the problem beneath our rampant corruption, witchcraft, child sacrifice, domestic violence, and immorality is the problem of a sinful human heart. Only Jesus, whose laws of love are written on our hearts because he lives in our hearts, can solve this problem Only acknowledging our human problem of a corrupt heart will lead us to the ultimate and true solution to our problems - Jesus - because his name still means ""he will save people from their sins."" So, this Christmas season I want to thank our government for doing the hard work of rooting out corruption through the means available to them. Please, continue to shine light in all the corners of darkness, not just the high profile ones. And, please, follow through on all cases. But, we must never think this is the only hope available to us. There is always hope because Jesus was born and his name still means ""he will save people from their sins."" So, this Christmas, I want to encourage all of us to dedicate or rededicate our lives to Jesus. In the challenges of our Uganda today, which are no worse than the challenges of the world into which Jesus was born, Jesus is our only hope...because his name still means ""he will save people from their sins."" I send warm Christmas greetings to President Yoweri Museveni, Maama Janet and their entire family and all our government leaders. I also send sincere greetings, along with prayers for a blessed Christmas for the Kabaka and Nabagereka of Buganda, and for our Roman Catholic, Orthodox and Pentecostal brethren, and all those who have looked in hope for the coming of the One who will save people from their sins, Jesus the Christ.

Ghost soldiers, stolen GAVI funds, the scramble to ""eat"" during Chogm, alleged bribes in oil contracts, theft in the national ID project, someone carrying away masts at the state broadcaster UBC and flogging its land, the list is endless. When the 38-year-old rule of KANU in Kenya ended in defeat in the December 2002 elections, and people surveyed just how much corruption had taken place over the years, one observer declared: ""Kenya must be truly rich, for it to be so 'eaten', yet it still standing"". The same might be said of Uganda. Less endowed country, would have bled to death from the corruption of the last 20 years. Everything that King Midas of Greek mythology touched turned to gold. Nearly everything that the Kampala government touches these days turns to rot. Still, what is happening offers us valuable insights into how power functions in Africa. The corruption we are witnessing today must be seen as the price/cost of regime that has stayed in power for nearly 30 years. The thousands of Ugandans who own cars will understand this well. You might be in love with your old car, just as some Ugandans probably still support the near-30-year-old Museveni government. But it breaks down all the time, its consumption is horrible, and it spends more time in the garage than on the road. In the end, it is always cheaper to get rid of it and buy a new one. In the years that the NRM has been in power, the average long-term car owner has had five cars to achieve efficiencies. But they have had one government and president. The maintenance cost of the regime is therefore higher. The problem is not the simply the NRM, because a power can renew itself. Rather that the NRM has offered the country just one leader. So what exactly makes this leadership expensive? Again, let us give an example. Mobile phone companies like Airtel, MTN, Warid more than any industry, are always giving you deals for cheaper calls. This is no accident. The sharp end of the telecom market is the young people. Huge discounts today pay off in the long term, because if you get a young person of 20 to sign up for your service, you have a chance of keeping him or her for the next 30 years. Likewise, if you take a mortgage at age 25, the cost (or at least burden of payment) is lower than when you do it when you are 60 and have few years to pay it. Thus 20 years ago, when some could still reasonably argue that the Museveni government was the future, its cost to the public in terms of corruption was quite low. The thing is that the Museveni government is no longer the future. The penalty the voters pay for keeping it in power is much higher. You know a government will unload a heavy burden on you when it can only run on its past record. How it brought security. How it rescued the economy. How it introduced UPE. How it rehabilitated roads (then they went to waste), and so on. Of course, some old things are very valuable. A vintage wine grows more precious with age. So do Rembrandt and Picasso paintings. You buy a Picasso for Shs250m today; you will sell it for Shs750m in two years. If you invest Shs250m in the Museveni government today, you will have to write off in two years. Where you make a profit of Shs500m on a Picasso painting, you lose Shs500m on the government. New leaders and their governments are cheaper because, like Museveni in 1986, money spent on them is seen as an investment in the future. Thus, in 1996, for example, the Museveni campaign did not really have to pay for votes. Instead, it was drowning in voluntary contributions by a grateful public. Compare that to the situation in February. The cost of getting votes had shot up so astronomically, that the country was virtually bankrupted to ensure victory. In this, situation accountability mechanisms and checks on corruption simply collapse. For all the noise, resignations and stepping-asides, arrests, and half-hearted trials, nothing will change, because corruption is now a political problem intricately linked to the fact that the same bunch of fellows has held power for nearly 30 years. The NRM can solve this problem, through reinventing itself and offering a new leadership. Or the people of Uganda can by throwing the whole NRM lot out of power. The Ugandan corruption monster has grown so huge and menacing, it cannot be got rid of by just pinching its skin as we are doing. cobbo@ke.nationmedia.com & twitter@cobbo3"1019,The Monitor (Kampala),12/11/2011,The Changing Faces of Corruption,,UGANDA (96%),,,Newspaper,Timothy Kalyegira,ENGLISH,982 words,,12-Dec-11,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (73%)",CORRUPTION (91%); COUPS (91%); EMBEZZLEMENT (90%); ARMIES (90%); BRIBERY (89%); ARMED FORCES (89%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (79%); SCANDALS (79%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (78%); MILITARY RULE (77%); REBELLIONS & INSURGENCIES (77%); CIVIL SERVICES (76%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (74%); INTELLIGENCE SERVICES (73%); ILLEGAL WEAPONS (71%); ARRESTS (71%); SMUGGLING (64%); RELIGION (50%) Uganda; Corruption,"Corruption, when it goes from small figures and occasional breaches of the law to becoming runaway and pervasive all over the country is proof that President Museveni is not as in control of events in Uganda as has always been widely believed. The reason it is believed there has not been a military coup in Uganda for more than 26 years is because Museveni was thought to be in total control of the army, police and intelligence services. No mutineer or coup plotter in any square kilometer of Ugandan territory or even abroad could sit down and plan a coup without it somehow leaking to intelligence or being crushed by the army. No politician could stand up to Museveni for the same reason, it was assumed. This image of a president who knows where every soldier from every unit is every morning in radio calls with his headquarters and field commanders became a deterrent against a coup. For this same reason, corruption as a national way of life was not much heard of before 1990. Civil servants and government ministers, fearing this recently victorious guerrilla leader would arrest them if they dared embezzle public funds, if they were corrupt did so as discreetly as possible. Today, corruption has become ""Proudly Ugandan"", proudly and defiantly unashamed of what it is. Ministers accused of embezzling Global Fund money, ministers named in oil bribery scandals, publicly assert their innocence, insist they will not step down; they appear at church services and fundraisings, and social gatherings. The corrupt now enjoy high job security and confidence that by and large they will get away with their deeds. This leads us to the next question: If the head of state is not in firm control and every Ugandan, it now seems can be bribed or can steal, how secure in power is the NRM government? If bribery and large-scale corruption are now a national way of life, who is to say where this will stop? If Presidential Guard Brigade soldiers are reported several times in the media to have made off with substantial sums of money and somehow life goes on, what will happen the day a foreign government hostile to Museveni decides to place soldiers of the PGB on a secret payroll? Can Museveni's guards be bribed to turn their guns on him? Can arms be secretly smuggled onto his helicopter or jet to be used on him? Even if there are a few among Museveni's innermost circles who are still loyal to him, what guarantee is there that they can resist the bribes and mass theft that the President's own Cabinet ministers casually engage in? For Museveni to remain safe, he must now have a select group of people, both civilian and military, who are loyal to the end if need be. But those same loyalists also must be above moral reproach. They must be the type to whom $700,000 is offered but they politely turn it down. Then, on top of these rare traits, they must be trained and precise in their knowledge and skills, in electronics, bomb disposal, crowd control and other security basics. How many Ugandans are there left who can be totally loyal to Museveni, who also are not corrupt and who have the necessary technical skills to thwart any danger? When we see this rampant corruption, we cannot rule out that the sums of money are more than an individual needs, even for luxurious living. Under the guise of grabbing whatever can be grabbed, might some of this money be going to prepare for a war or some kind of insurrection? Two weeks ago, a former UNLA soldier told me the full story of the July 1985 military coup that ousted President Milton Obote. The political climate was strikingly like what we see in Uganda today, except for the corruption. There was intrigue in the army and within the ruling UPC party; intrigue between the Langi and Acholi in the UNLA army; intrigue between the Catholic Acholi and the Protestant Acholi in the army. The centre just fell to pieces. Right now, the younger NRM MPs have taken on such a vigorous public crusade against corruption that they have ended up doing even better than the opposition DP and FDC MPs in this regard. Attempts and threats at the Kyankwanzi Leadership Institute by the President to force these ""rebel"" NRM MPs back into the party line have failed and they are now back to a new front, this time against the Minister of the Presidency, Kabakumba Masiko. Kabakumba's almost amusing tale of having taken equipment intended for UBC radio and used it for her Kings FM radio station in Masindi is a curious one. She insists she will not resign and told Parliament that she is willing to cooperate fully in any investigation it might wish to carry out, anything to ""get to the bottom of this."" The story was given much prominence by the state-owned media and the police was seen to uncharacteristically move swiftly against a Cabinet minister. In this climate one wonders: did Kabakumba really steal that UBC equipment or might it have been a set up, part of the intrigue within the NRM, one faction seeking to discredit another? Was she getting close to the President in such a way that powerful forces within the NRM decided to bring her down? Watching all this, most business people have concluded that they simply don't stand a chance of making a fair profit in this trading environment by following procedure and the law, and have therefore decided that they too will bend the law. They arrange to make illegal power connections, evade taxes, inflate invoices, and this is now down to every level of society. Last week, the US ambassador to Uganda, Jerry Lainer, warned that Uganda had better be prepared for major belt-tightening because the current economic crisis in western nations demands that foreign aid be cut back and this money diverted to the millions of domestically unemployed. With corruption this rampant and donor money soon to dry up, the amount of money in circulation will increase pressure and resentment in Ugandan society."1020,The Monitor (Kampala),12/9/2011,Activists Attack Government Over 'Soft' Handling of Corruption Cases,,UGANDA (96%),,,Newspaper,John Njoroge,ENGLISH,344 words,,9-Dec-11,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (91%)",CORRUPTION (96%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (91%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (90%); EXECUTIVES (77%); SUPREME COURTS (75%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (69%); JUDGES (69%); AIDS & HIV (53%) Uganda; Corruption,"Anti-corruption activists have expressed disappointment over what they described as government's lack of good will and commitment to fight the vice. Speaking during the first Annual National Anti-Corruption Convention yesterday in Kampala, the activists criticised President Museveni for ""his soft approach towards corrupt government officials"". In a keynote address prepared by ACODE Executive Director Godber Tumushabe and read by NGO Forum's Arthur Larok, the activists advised Ugandans to look elsewhere for solutions against corruption other than from government. ""The Constitution should be reclaimed. The President has an opportunity to make announcements to unlock opportunities to fight corrupt,"" Mr Tumushabe's presentation read in part. Retired Supreme Court Judge George Kanyeihamba said corruption has created unrest in the minds of many Ugandans, saying a government of corrupt officials will not be in power for very long. ""Ugandans must have courage to speak up,"" Justice Kanyeihamba said. He also appealed for ""a list of shame"" to be adopted by the media to publish the names of public officials involved in corruption. Army MP Gen. Elly Tumwiine, also present at the meet, encouraged Ugandans to ""ignore fear, intimidation"" and ""defend Uganda against corruption."" He caused laughter when he noted that just like HIV/Aids, many a times, corruption is conceived in secret. Meanwhile, Western Youth MP Gerald Karuhanga, describing the state of corruption in government in a poem recital, said: ""The behavior of our leaders in ungodly"". An academic, Prof. Mwambutsya Ndebesa, called for a shift in methodology of fighting corruption to performance-based accountability imposed on leaders. He called on Ugandans to perform their roles as citizens and not as subjects of a system. Female Youth MP Monica Amoding laid blame on the last two generation of mothers who, she said, failed to instill virtues of honesty in the current crop of leaders. She said the biggest challenge lawmakers face is demand for money from their electorate. jnjoroge@ug.nationmedia.com"1021,The Monitor (Kampala),12/2/2011,Country Falls Further Down Corruption Ladder,,UGANDA (94%); AFRICA (92%); RWANDA (79%); BURUNDI (79%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%),,,Newspaper,Emmanuel Gyezaho,ENGLISH,313 words,,2-Dec-11,,POLITICAL CORRUPTION (92%); CORRUPTION (92%); RANKINGS (90%); BRIBERY (89%); EMBEZZLEMENT (78%); SCANDALS (78%); POLLS & SURVEYS (77%); NATIONAL IDENTITY CARDS (50%) Uganda; Corruption,"For the fifth straight year, Uganda has continued to score badly on corruption, according to the latest world ranking on perception of graft levels in countries around the globe. Ranked among the most corrupt nations, Uganda is at position 143 of 183 surveyed countries in the 2011 corruption perception index released yesterday by global graft watchdog, Transparency International (TI). The index, an aggregate indicator measuring perceived levels of public sector corruption, is drawn on assessments and opinion surveys with questions related to bribery of public officials, kickbacks in public procurement, embezzlement of public funds, and the effectiveness of public sector anti-corruption efforts. Countries are scored on a scale of 0(highly corrupt), to 10 (very clean). Uganda scored 2.4, down from 2010's 2.5. But government dismissed the ranking, saying it is devoid of ""scientific substance"" to offer accurate measure of corruption levels in the country. Only Burundi posted a worse ranking than Uganda in the East African region, at position 172, while Rwanda, one of only two African countries in the top 50 of ""very clean"" countries, topped the region. Mr Raphael Baku, the acting IGG, said he had ""a problem"" with the index because perception can often be deceptive. ""They (reports) may give the impression that corruption has increased in the country just because of what is happening at the time of the surveys."" But Prof. Edward Kakonge, the chairman of the Uganda Debt Network, said: ""This ranking has been kind to Uganda. We are actually worse off.""

The revelations, thanks to committed Members of Parliament, are shocking and have taken the country by surprise. This in a country that has impassable roads, inadequate medicines in hospitals, poorly paid teachers, rising prices of consumer goods, etc. One would have expected the President to put his weight behind investigations to get to the root of these allegations. But to everyone's surprise, the President turned judge and pronounced his ministers innocent. This and many other corruption allegation scandals have been swept under the carpet. The President has persistently declared some of his ministers innocent and hinting that they are being witch-hunted. As for former Vice President Gilbert Bukenya abuse of office allegation case, the President said he (Prof. Bukenya) was innocent. The President might be right in all these cases. However, would it be better for him to allow due process take its course? And assuming the corruption allegations were true, is the President aware of the trickle-down effects of the money that are allegedly lost or misused by the accused ministers were the funds to be properly used to fund infrastructure development, education and pay teachers a decent salary, etc? Unfortunately, most sectors in this country are mismanaged. For example, the IGG's office has variously been accused of being used by the government to fight political wars. The health, education, and agriculture sectors are in a sorry state. Economically speaking, the prices of all commodities have skyrocketed. Yet the President has been quoted as saying the rise in prices is good for the economy. With static salaries or dwindling earnings, how will Ugandans get the extra money to accommodate the rising prices? The actual beneficiary of the rising price is certainly not Ugandans. Oil is a national resource that should benefit all Ugandans. For now, it is apparent that the ruling NRM government is not ready to deliver prosperity for all. From the look of things, we are likely to see more corruption, impunity, and rising prices of commodity and food prices.

This point-blank shot at corruption needs to be reinforced by all crusaders of anti-corruption -especially public servants. Anti-corruption speeches need to be streamlined without contradictory utterances from stakeholders. Unfortunate utterances by public servants, including by President Museveni that questioning sources of ill-gotten wealth of Ugandan oligarchs is bound to cripple his government is wrong. Equally injurious is the assertion by northern Uganda rehabilitation minister Rebecca Otengo that corruption is here to stay and there is no way the government, NGOs, and the public could stamp out the vice from Uganda. The two statements are ill-conceived and tantamount to abetting corruption in Uganda. They run contrary to Government efforts to stamp out corruption. No wonder, the array of machinery at Government's disposal to fight corruption remain dormant. Uganda's high maternal and infant deaths, impassable roads, poorly-stocked hospitals and more deaths from Aids, malaria and TB and other failed public service delivery are all tied to corruption, which eats up Shs500 billion yearly according the World Bank. We have failed to impose stern deterrent penalties to violators of the Anti-Corruption Act. Government has failed to act rigorously to implement the Whistleblower Protection Act to follow up leads and apprehend thieving public servants and recover stolen public funds and utilities. Even the arm of the Auditor General, which has been strengthened by the National Audit Act 2008, remains feeble as several high profile government officials implicated in misuses of the multi-billion 2007 Chogm funds have walked off scot free! But we commend minister Otengo's proposed comprehensive approach to tackling the root causes of corruption, including scrutinising some questionable donor practices.

She added that the 9th Parliament will not tolerate any corruption tendecies in government. Her comments were contained in a message read out on her behalf by Ndorwa West MP David Bahati on Tuesday at the end of the annual general meeting of the 5th East African Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities held in Entebbe. To back her claim, the Speaker said research had shown that up to 20 per cent of the budgets for the East African member states end up in the pockets of the corrupt while millions continue to wallow in poverty. She said the region is at a crossroads as corruption robs hardworking citizens of the opportunity to live better lives. ""It is because of corruption that Africa continues to grapple with challenges of inadequate infrastructure, poverty, war, disease, famine, high maternal and infant mortality rates,"" said the Kamuli Woman MP. Discussions at the two-day conference focused on the strategies of promoting zero tolerance to corruption in East Africa. Several delegates from Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan attended the conference. Despite a wide array of machinery at the government's disposal to fight graft, the vice continues to blight development in the country, delegates heard. That reality has left some like Judge John Bosco Katutsi, the former head of the Anti-Corruption Court, concluding that graft can only be solved if the culprits are hanged like it's done in China. The World Bank, a few years ago, said at least Shs500 billion is lost due to graft in Uganda annually. Ms Kadaga said Parliament had instituted measures to fight graft like the enactment of the Anti-Corruption Act, which strengthened the penalties for corruption offences. She also cited the enactment of the Whistleblowers Protection Act 2010 that provides for protection and reward of individuals who report corruption cases that result in recovery of public funds as well as the National Audit Act 2008, which empowers the Auditor General to scrutinise books of accounts of the entire organisation where government has interest.

""They accessed the money by virtue of their offices, causing financial loss contrary to Section 20 of the Anti-Corruption Act 2009,"" the charges read. Witnesses testifying against the accused, including 15 teachers in whose names the money had been drawn, denied receiving the payment. The fate of the three officers will be decided at the next hearing in Kampala Anti-Corruption Court on November 29. editorial@ug.nationmedia.com"1026,The Monitor (Kampala),11/16/2011,Donors Slash Government Aid Over Corruption,,NETHERLANDS (94%); UGANDA (94%); EUROPE (92%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (92%); IRELAND (79%); AFRICA (78%),,,Newspaper,Patience Ahimbisibwe,ENGLISH,590 words,,17-Nov-11,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (90%)",POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); EUROPEAN UNION (90%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (90%); LITERACY & ILLITERACY (89%); CORRUPTION (89%); BUDGETS (89%); EURO (89%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (78%); PUBLIC FINANCE (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION (78%); SCHOOL DROP OUTS (78%); SCHOOL BUDGETS (78%); EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (76%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (74%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (73%); SECONDARY SCHOOLS (50%) Uganda; Corruption; Europe and Africa; Education,"The Uganda government was last evening left searching for alternative sources of funding following the withdrawal of support to the education sector by one of its key donors. The Dutch government announced it was withdrawing funding to a tune of nearly Shs50b (14 million Euro), citing concerns over persistent corruption, poor public financial management and poor standards. Dutch Ambassador to Uganda Jeroen Verheul said it was ""time to ask ourselves some uncomfortable questions,"" on the issue of what quality learners were getting adding that the ""seriousness of this problem cannot be overstated."" He was speaking on behalf of other development partners at the start of the annual Education Sector review in Kampala yesterday. He described the quality of basic education (literacy and numeracy skills), the major concerns under UPE as ""disappointing."" The Dutch withdrawal follows that of the Irish government which earlier withdrew from budget support to concentrate on project support. The reaction of other donors in the European Union was not immediately clear but Communications Officer at the EU delegation in Kampala Simon Kasyate said the individual member countries were taking action on their own. ""This marks the exit of Netherlands as a supporter of basic education. The results we have been achieving since the introduction of UPE have been disappointing and we decided to shift our focus to productive areas like agriculture,"" Ambassador Verheul said. According to Amb.Verheul, they have been spending 14 million Euros (about Shs49 billion) annually since the start of UPE in 1997 to support basic education. ""About a year and a half ago, we warned that there were issues with regard to public financial management, corruption, fiscal policy in terms of the choices that we make and we warned that that might have an impact on us being able to provide budget support. So this is not a surprise for the authority,"" he explained. Education Minister Jessica Alupo admitted that government had been alerted to the impending aid cuts and had increased the Education sector budget to Shs1.3trillion in response. Speaking in some of the most candid language a diplomat has used on the thorny issues of corruption and poor standards, Ambassador Verheul said, ""literacy is the basis for the acquisition of all but the basic life skills. Right now more than 40 per cent of the ever growing number at P3 level is illiterate. They--and their fellows who dropped out of school--stand very little chance of ever making it to any form of secondary education."" He said targets set between them as donors and government had not been met. Ambassador Verheul was equally livid about the lip service fight against corruption announcing a major drawback of his government's supports to Justice Law and Order Sector from the current annual Euro18m to only Euro 6million. ""There have been issues in regard to procurement of text books where there are allegations of corruption,"" he said. He added that they will continue to support a number of project activities in primary education with an estimated 3 to 4 million euros this year. She admitted that there have been instances of ""shoddy work in schools, suppliers of instructional materials not following procurement procedures, loss of funds and students losing on training because of our mistakes as technical people in the ministry."" But she hoped with the launch of the ministry's client charter, it will empower the public to demand what is not being implemented in future. pahimbisibwe@ug.nationmedia.com"1027,The Monitor (Kampala),10/30/2011,Museveni Can Still Fight Corruption [editorial],,UGANDA (93%),,,Newspaper,,ENGLISH,358 words,,31-Oct-11,,CORRUPTION (92%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); BRIBERY (90%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (78%); PRIME MINISTERS (73%); OIL & GAS INDUSTRY (72%) Uganda; Corruption,"The political and therefore the public mood in the country has been consumed by the debates in Parliament over revelations that some Cabinet ministers were bribed by oil firm Tullow, in the process of getting its business end tied down with the government of Uganda. Two of the ministers linked to the scandal have since stepped aside from their offices to allow investigations to start. Prime Minister, Amama Mbabazi, also named in the scandal has resisted such calls. President Museveni has defended his ministers and is resisting any attempt to sack his close allies instead treating the claims of bribery as hearsay propagated by witch-hunters. Both sides of the divide in the House seem to be separated by the lack of honesty and willingness to listen but mostly accepting responsibility even though temporarily to allow investigations to take place. Moral responsibility would dictate that any public official not encumbered by self-interest and serving the nation for its own good would step aside from the public office they occupy and return once they are proven innocent. Unfortunately, President Museveni himself, a public official, seems to operate in self-interest when it comes to dealing decisively with corruption. He has in the past admonished corruption where it does not seem to suit him and yet playing defender of people on whom mill stones of corruption hung by their necks where upon such people are close allies to him. Over time however, public opinion is turning against the President's stance on how to deal with corruption in his government. Despite claims of witch-hunt, the public is keen to see those claiming to be innocent proven so through some form of statutory investigation process. Any attempt to hinder that would seem to cement the belief - true or false - that President Museveni is himself obstructing further revelations of the evil in government. But we believe the President still has the will to get rid of corruption by borrowing a leaf from other countries - they are several examples - where the President has sought to disassociate himself from his inner circle members whenever they are named in corruption."1028,The Monitor (Kampala),10/28/2011,We Need to Know; Is Govt Oiling Development or Corruption?

We have been made to believe that Uganda's modest oil resources, once exploited, will greatly benefit our economy, development and people. Lots of money was spent training human resources in preparation for a whirlwind exploitation of oil, which was believed, especially by our President, would go a long way in contributing to the resolution of our chronic fuel crisis. We are talking about some 4,000 barrels of oil per day. The ten million dollar question is, will oil really oil our economy, development and people out of poverty? Well, oil did so in Norway, but here more than 2.9 million barrels are produced per day with a great proportion consumed locally and a lot more exported to lucrative markets in Europe and the USA. With proper institutionalisation, including policies and laws that empower communities rather than dispossess them corruption, corporate greed and political gerrymandering, have been put in check. Not so in Nigeria, where it is difficult to break the symbiotic relationship between the politico-military establishment and the oil companies, especially Shell BP. Here, people die daily in oil related violence in their attempt to show their indignation that although 2.5 million barrels of oil are mined daily, poverty among the poor has been on the rise almost proportionate to governmental and individual corruption of the rulers and corporate. In Uganda, we have a formidable politico-military establishment that seems to be frantically working, not so much to make our people sovereign over their land and natural resources such as oil, as to grab whatever they can lay their hands on. They have put in place constitutional and legal instruments to disempower They have established a new ownership society of the rich and powerful that will not allow civility to reign vis-avis natural resources. We now see the Executive using every means to protect the corrupt officials accused of having taken bribes in the oil industry. We have heard once again that some MPs have been paid Shs5 million each to ensure that the oil decisions of Parliament pinning some ministers alleged to have accepted bribes from oil firms to step aside as investigations of corruption are carried out by Parliament are being rethought? The Executive, therefore, poses the greatest threat to democracy and justice in the industry, and also to the autonomy of Parliament. There are many little firms that have been created to do one thing or another in the oil industry. We do not know who the real owners of the little firms are. It is likely that they belong to some of our most powerful in the land. It is also likely the most powerful individuals have acquired large shares in those companies. Therefore, if oil in Uganda ever gets exploited the real beneficiaries will be the rulers, their spouses, family members and those who have been sucked into the long, winding patronage chain. Unless there is change of behaviour in the oil industry, like in Nigeria, it will be grief, not prosperity, for our struggling, increasingly impoverished poor, and spiraling corruption of the politico-military and corporate. Well, what else should we expect in a country that became the first truly international Bantustan at the beginning of the end of the late 1990s, and seems to be far from dropping the label for another country to take over? For now it is the President to watch. Meanwhile don't say ""Oiling development""; say ""Oiling corruption,"" with the full participation of corporate.

This fight is complicated and is comparable to the global fight against international drug and human traffickers. Quite a complex feat interlaced, driven and sustained by high level political corruption within the party because the NRM party has become synonymous with and a prime agent of corruption. Underneath the lucrative global trafficking are networks of cartels and warloads; a network of pimps, johns and numerous trans-border traffickers, mafias, gangsters, politicians and conglomerates that operate through porous borders and corrupt migration policy enforcement to ship out and trade in humans, drugs and weapons. We can agree that most successful underground organisations involved in these illicit trades, have god-fathers. The god-father is the superimposing character - well protected and a nexus upon which the conditions and environment of their businesses are mediated. The godfathers are usually obsolete figures that are at an arm's length away from the scenes of transactions. They pull cords to control political power through bribery, coercion and indulge in procurement of allegiance from contending politicians and business people. The trading families who control large markets and many trafficking routes become the most powerful, fierce and equally respected. The family business becomes the costa nostra ""our thing"" and cousins marry fellow cousins to keep the wealth and power within the house. The La Costa Nostra attitude that was prevalent among the Italian mafias and others in Latin America is what now subsumes the NRM regime. The structure that the President has built in 25 years is strong but is not any different from those operated by rogue elements in illicit trades. There is no need to explicate this situation any further, but Museveni has consolidated his stronghold on the means of coercion. His rule is branded by militarised police brutality. His suspected associates relatives have consolidated their positions and privileges at the helm of the regime structure and have control of vast amount of land and other economic advantages, including ownership of lands that have minerals, fresh waters and oil reserves. In the words of Kevin Bales, the renowned anti-human trafficking author and researcher, Ugandans who are not obedient to the networks of the political family, are ""disposable people"". This is what became very apparent of former VP Gilbert Bukenya. Prof. Bukenya's recent time in jail over his alleged part in the Chogm scandal spoke volumes to those who have the ears to listen and the eyes, not yet bloated by the proceeds of corruption, to see. Prof. Bukenya is a typical example of an uncritical NRM outsider and a conduit. Despite his illustrious administrative competence, he was reduced to a disposable entity. The moment Prof. Bukenya tried to form political shape, he was quickly disposed of and presented as the prime agent of corruption. In reality, Prof. Bukenya is only an (in)subordinate agent. And let's put aside the two-faces that we carry. I truly felt for Prof. Bukenya as he froze in the coolers. I could not fathom the man in Prof. Bukenya so determined to remain in the kitchen sink - humiliated and humiliated again. I thought Prof. Bukenya would have listened to the messages of the mafia when his son perished in a car accident under mysterious circumstances that is only comparable to that of former Speaker Francis Ayume. Prof. Bukenya should have known that he is treading a rough path. But let's contend that the real problem of corruption in Uganda is neatly weaved and inextricable with the circumstances of President Museveni's continued tenure of office that has been translated as ""our power"" by the people close to him. Let's be realistic and honest to ourselves before we claim patriotism here. We are chasing our shadows in pretext of tackling corruption. The organism called NRM has mutated to have many corrupt heads. We must identify all the heads and tentacles for it to get capitulated. I believe that a genuine process of removing corruption from Uganda can only start with change. As long as Museveni is still president of Uganda, corruption will move with him for, corruption is the NRM itself!

In any election, the issues are many - difficult to distil and some tend to be local. For example, the issue of oil and Bunyoro's lousy bargain is a big issue in one part of the country while the end of the Northern War is a big issue in another part of the country. Corruption seems to be a recurrent issue understood in fairly universal terms across the country. Each year comes with a new dimension. The historical areas of interest remain the same: Offences of procurement dating from the days of the Central Tender Board. In the military during times of war, procurement turned soldiers into owners of business conglomerates. Every so often, reminders of this era come back to the public eye. General Saleh's daughter recently lost petty cash worth Shs500m to a housemaid. In the public sector, offences of procurement are then padded with illicit acquisition of wealth, unjust enrichment, and plain theft. Procurement can be very creative like the smart idea one day that saw the Police transition from a couple of worn uniforms: duty and dress to 16 uniforms in one swoop. Many public sector executives routinely do business with the entities they run or regulate. Perhaps the only executive who has not received a business model to execute this is Allen Kagina, the chief executive of the Uganda Revenue Authority. Outgoing Kampala Mayor Nasser Sebaggala took this further after helping KCC get rid of most of its ""excess inventory"" by asking to take home into retirement his physical office to mark the end of the era of the executive mayor. In the political environment, the politics of giving and sharing is a bi-partisan sport. MPs currently facing re-election are strained by all sorts of financial pressures that an impoverished electorate imposes upon them. An elected official whether from the ruling party or the opposition is an important asset in the political system. He or she distributes the crumbs from the table. While public land was being parcelled out in the last decade, cronies affiliated to the ruling party always sought political cover by sharing with their opponents from the opposition. It is instructive that the worst offenders in the local governments come from both the ruling party and the opposition. During his campaigns upcountry Kizza Besigye has ""failed"" to address voters on several radio stations all owned by MPs. It appears to be that one of the qualifications of becoming an MP is owning a radio station starting with the Vice President Gilbert Bukenya going all the way down to junior backbenchers. Any discussion of corruption that excludes donors is a joke. The donor community serves as an important interface between the metropolitan economy represented by the first world and the third world where opportunities and markets are still being nurtured. The mechanisms for measuring leakages initiated by donor projects are not well developed. Norbert Mao has used a rudimentary mechanism to count all the foreign aid Uganda has received since 1986 with Uganda's GDP. This method may ruthlessly combine successful donor initiatives like President Bush's PEPFAR, which actually treat patients, with ponzi schemes like the Luweero Marshall Fund that never materialised in the 1980s, PAPSCA, Entandikwa, Bonna Baggagawale and the likes. In fact to add salt to the wound, the World Bank recently announced a new round of grants and development support that include a $30m cassava research programme. Teso, Uganda's former cassava granary would be happy to work on more pressing priorities which in turn would boost farmer productivity and income without spending $30m studying the problem. For President Museveni, the discussion of corruption solves two strategic problems. First, it is the only avenue he can use to universally tame his allies in NRM and the opposition. No major political figure in office can survive a major anti-corruption probe - not the likes of chicken eats an egg- Cheeye kind of trials. This litmus test applies to all sorts of individuals and potential trouble-makers from Vice President Bukenya to Trade Minister Kahinda Otafiire, former Health Minister Jim Muhwezi and now new arrival in the Movement Nasser Sebaggala. In fact, the dog and pony show in Parliament probing misuse of public funds always conducted with dramatisations for the media has created very wealthy and powerful people in Parliament; who find evidence of malfeasance, collect from the victim(s) before exonerating them. By lamenting about corruption, President Museveni gives himself political cover to pick a sacrificial lamb once in a while to keep the trains moving on time. For his opponents, they sound naí¿ve by wasting time prescribing pain killers for an increasingly deadly cancer measured now in terms of lives lost due to a crumbling healthcare system. With all the media focused on the living arrangements and lifestyles of the opposition leaders, one only sees heirs to the system rather than angels vested with supernatural powers to destroy, kill and rebuild.

Speaking at a Democracy and Good Governance conference in Bujumbura, Burundi, Ms Beatrice Kiraso, the deputy secretary general in charge of Political Federation said the vice has undermined development and the provision of social services, which subsequently has increased the cost of doing business. She said: ""Corruption is an evil that undermines development and provision of social services."" The conference hosted by the East African Law Society during its Annual General Meeting brought together about 400 researchers from the East African region. Ms Kiraso briefed the meeting about EAC efforts towards ensuring democracy and good governance. The draft EAC Protocol on Good Governance covers four broad distinct pillars which are in effect inter-related. They include democracy and democratisation processes, human rights and equal opportunities, anti-corruption, ethics and integrity and rule of law and access to justice. She said a draft protocol on preventing and combating corruption has been developed covering asset recovery, forfeiture, transfer of criminals and criminal proceedings, among the key provisions. The drafted protocol provides for extradition, judicial cooperation and mutual legal assistance and establishes a financial intelligence unit within the region. Ms Kiraso said the recent increase in corruption cases in the region is not a result of lack of legal instruments but a result of reluctance in implementation and enforcement. She said lack of political will to fight corruption is one of the main challenges facing the region in eliminating the vice. The Deputy Secretary General also emphasized the role of the sector on Rule of Law and Access to Justice in the region, stating that their major focus is to promote enactment of just laws to facilitate effective administration of justice ""in a manner that guarantees social justice, prevention of conflicts, peace and political stability."""1032,The Monitor (Kampala),11/19/2010,Districts Come Top in New Corruption List of Shame,,UGANDA (96%),,,Newspaper,Yasiin Mugerwa,ENGLISH,542  words,,19-Nov-10,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (90%)",CORRUPTION (93%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (89%); SCHOOL DISTRICTS (89%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (89%); ANNUAL REPORTS (78%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (78%); EMBEZZLEMENT (77%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (77%); BUDGETS (74%); ARRESTS (72%); STATISTICS (70%); CITY GOVERNMENT (64%); MISAPPROPRIATION (60%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (50%) Uganda; Crime and Corruption,"A new report by the Inspectorate of Government has ranked districts among the top public institutions most frequently complained about by Ugandans due to perceptions that they are perennially corrupt. On a day the IGG, Mr Raphael Baku, released the report to the public, writers accused the ombudsman of incompetence and voiced concerns that he is shunning the corrupt ""big fish"" in government- entrenching corruption in the system. But Mr Baku said yesterday: ""We have more people who appear to be small fish because we received more complaints from the local governments. It's not that we fear big people. As a matter of fact, we have established a directorate of operations to look for the corrupt in the central government."" ""We haven't been able to initiate our own investigations into some of the corruption cases in the central government because we lack adequate and professional staff to find what you call the ""big fish."" Most complaints received by the IGG were against district administrators which were 207 of the total complaints received. ""We are already overwhelmed by the complaints we received from the public. This is an indication that people are getting involved in the fight against corruption,"" Mr Baku said. The districts have for the third financial year running topped the list of the most complained about institutions representing 19.9 per cent. Some 1,040 complaints were received and only 629 were investigated to conclusion in the year under review. About 109 complaints were processed and later referred to other institutions. In the previous year, the IGG received 2,933 complaints of which 288 were investigated and concluded and about 230 cases referred to other institutions for further scrutiny. Available figures from the World Bank show that Uganda loses more than Shs500 billion to corruption annually. This is more than 10 per cent of the total national budget. During the year under review, 40 public officers mainly from the local governments were arrested for various corruption offences while 66 cases are still on-going in courts of law, 11 concluded and 15 cases were appealed. The IGG blamed the failure to prosecute the corrupt on the sluggishness of the judiciary. The annual report to Parliament for the year ending June 2010 puts government officials, who according to the IGG, ""have individually continued to use their office for private gain"" in the second position. The common nature of complaints against district administrators includes mismanagement and misappropriation of public funds, abuse of office, embezzlement and mishandling of tenders. Also in the report, Municipal Councils/Town Councils are in third spot followed by school authorities, the Police and the Local Councils respectively. Kampala for the third time remains in the first position among the top districts suspected to be corrupt with 484 complaints followed by Masaka with 76, Jinja 68, Soroti 58, Moyo 49, Fort Portal 46, Mbale 43 and Gulu 42. Moroto remains the least corrupt district followed by Lira, Mbarara, Hoima, Kabale and Tororo. The IGG has also invited the public to take incriminating evidence against the ministers and other government officials accused of pocketing more than Shs500 billions meant for Chogm meeting."1033,The Monitor (Kampala),11/15/2010,Our Change Politics Will Stamp Out Corruption,,UGANDA (93%),,,Newspaper,Kizza Besigye,ENGLISH,628  words,,15-Nov-10,,CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (90%); POLITICS (90%); CORRUPTION (89%); TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE (78%); PRIVATIZATION (78%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (78%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (78%); REBELLIONS & INSURGENCIES (78%); HEALTH CARE (75%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (73%); PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS (73%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (69%); NURSES & NURSING (67%); DEATHS & DEATH RATES (66%); DRUG SHORTAGES (52%); AGRICULTURAL PRICES (50%) Uganda; Governance,"Inter-Party Cooperation flag bearer, Dr Kizza Besigye has been on the campaign trail hammering away at National Resistance Movement's record in government under President Museveni. He has told campaign rallies across south western Buganda where he began his campaign that the country finds itself in dire straits because of, among other things, the paucity of accountable leadership. Dr Besigye, who is running against President Museveni in a third straight contes,t holds the firm belief that one of the failures of this administration is the deliberate or otherwise inability of the regime's leadership to punish those either suspected of, or found guilty of, dabbling in corruption. He identifies one of the reasons behind this failure as being the closeness of some of the culprits to the ruling party's core - and in some instances their direct personal relationship with the President. Over the years, he continues to tell voters, delivery of proper health services has deteriorated because corruption has been allowed to eat away at the infrastructure that should ideally be in place to fight disease. The shortage of essential drugs and health manpower which, he believes is directly responsible for high maternal and child mortality, for example. There is also the point that health centres are ill-equipped to handle even the most basic of health care needs. This is compounded by the fact that even the few doctors and nurses who remain in public health service today are very poorly paid. The candidate further blames the poor transport infrastructure in an economy that has been hobbled by what he says are recklessly implemented policies like privatisation of strategic parastatals on graft. The country's poor roads have repeatedly been a subject of Dr Besigye's speeches. He has observed in far flung places like Mityana that farmers are left at the mercy of unscrupulous middlemen who refer to the poor feeder roads when setting very low farm gate prices for produce. It is this politics of corruption that has been allowed to ferment across the body-politic of the country which the IPC leader seeks to replace if elected. He makes the following proposals in his campaign manifesto: ""We will fight corruption at all levels. We will have zero tolerance for corruption and all those found guilty of this offence will face severe punishment including refund. We will ensure that al organs to fight corruption are active and well facilitated. We will strengthen the civil societies and work with them in the fight against corruption. ""For 25 years money has been stolen by leaders of NRM. The government has nurtured corruption as a way of life in Uganda. It's in the public sector, it has now reached alarming levels and yet those who steal public funds are promoted. This has frustrated the efforts and aspiration of many Ugandans. It has reduced the chances of delivering the public goods such as education, health and infrastructure, thus hindering progress. The IPC government will do the following to end corruption: Implement a policy of zero tolerance to corruption through making corrupt practice a high risk venture Continue to ensure that the Public Accounts Committee [of Parliament] is headed by the opposition as a check on government. Ensure that corrupt officials are dealt with promptly and firmly according to the law without fear or favour hence recover what they have stolen. Educate and empower citizens, civil society organisations, and the media on their role in fighting corruption Make the offices of Attorney General, Inspector General of government, and Director of Public Prosecution more competent, independent and better facilitated.

Mr Museveni's decision to keep the officials in Cabinet, including protecting some of them from possible prosecution, has turned corruption into one of the main campaign issues, with the President's opponents accusing him of lacking the political will to fight graft. The UK government recently announced it was cutting Shs27 billion in promised aid over what it said was less-than-satisfactory progress on investigating senior ministers accused of corrupt practice and influence-peddling over the 2007 Chogm Summit in which billions were lost in dubious deals. Government officials say the UK decision did not take into consideration the on-going parliamentary inquiry into the matter as evidence of political will to address the problem. President Museveni and the ruling NRM have, in their re-election manifesto, pledged to continue fighting corruption. Mr Museveni says the NRM is committed to a policy of ""zero-tolerance to corruption"" and will, if re-elected, strengthen the investigative and prosecution capacity of anti-corruption agencies to be able to handle the new and more sophisticated cases of corruption, including cyber crime. Critics, both in the opposition and civil society, however, say President Museveni has failed to act on his promises. While many of the Cabinet ministers who have been accused have not been proven guilty, the failure to investigate the allegations against them has denied some of them an opportunity to clear their names, leaving a cloud of suspicion over many Cabinet ministers. A Daily Monitor investigation also reveals that some ministers who have been found guilty of improper conduct have been reappointed to Cabinet, often on promotion. Here are the men and women who serve with the President but who have been denied the chance to clear their names in court. The Public Accounts Committee accuses Prof. Bukenya of interfering with the procurement process during Chogm, contrary to the law, leading to a Shs5.6 billion loss. Prof. Bukenya denies the allegations. He told Parliament last week that the decisions were taken collectively by Cabinet with President Museveni's knowledge. Accused of diverting 2,000 litres of fuel from Uganda Railways Corporation in 1999 to help a political ally, Mr Kivejinja resigned just as MPs prepared to censure him as Transport minister. He returned to Cabinet in 2003 and was later promoted to his current portfolio. He was also found guilty of electoral malpractices during a bitter race against Abdu Katuntu for the Bugweri parliamentary seat in 2006. The PAC report accuses Prof Makubuya of signing off advances to private hoteliers ahead of Chogm without repayment guarantees. About Shs8 billion in taxpayers' money was lost in the process but Prof Makubuya denies any wrongdoing. The PAC report accuses Mr Mbabazi, who is also the NRM Secretary General, of interference and conflict of interest in the procurement of a communication system for the security agencies through the ICT ministry. MPs have also questions why the contract came in at about Shs4.1 billion higher but Mr Mbabazi denies any wrongdoing. A parliamentary inquiry in 2008 found Mr Mbabazi guilty of influence-peddling in a transaction in which he and a business associate, Mr Amos Nzeyi, sold land to the National Social Security Fund. Mr Mbabazi was later cleared by Parliament under controversial circumstances. The top two NSSF officials were fired and former MD David Jamwa is currently awaiting trial at the Anti-Corruption Court over related matters. PAC has recommended that minister Mwesigye and other government officials should be held liable for a loss of Shs280m to government arising from a Shs7 billion contract to clean up the city ahead of Chogm. Ms Mwesigye oversaw the process in her previous capacity as State Minister for Local Government and is accused of authorising payments to contractors against the advice of ministry technocrats, and of failing to declare monies paid by exhibitors. She denies all the allegations. The 6th Parliament in 1999 censured Mr Kutesa, then state minister for planning, for conflict of interest and abuse of office after he pushed for his company, Entebbe Handling Services, to take over the lucrative ground-handling at Entebbe Airport. This denied the already struggling Uganda Airlines much-needed revenue and contributed to the collapse of the national carrier.Mr Kutesa was reappointed to Cabinet shortly after and promoted. MPs investigating Chogm accuse him of conflict-of-interest for allegedly acting in concert with VP Bukenya to ensure that a company in which the minister, until 2005, owned a majority stake, supplied cars for the summit delegates. He denies all allegations. Gen. Otafiire resigned his ministerial position in the mid-90s after he drew a pistol on Jennifer, the late wife to Foreign Affairs Minister Sam Kutesa. In the incident over a drink at Fairway Hotel, Maj. Gen. Otafiire accused late Jennifer of having ""sucked"" the country to its ""bone marrow"". A 2002 UN Panel of Experts report accused Gen. Otafiire, alongside other senior army officers, of various transgressions in the Democratic Republic of Congo (where he'd been deployed after leaving Cabinet), including working with brutal allied local militias to ""plunder and pillage"" DR Congo resources. Gen. Otafiire in self-defence said there was nothing worth picking from DRC, and a government created Justice Potter Commission later exonerated all Ugandan officials implicated in the UN report. He was later reappointed to Cabinet but his stints in the Lands, Local Government and Trade and Tourism ministries have been marred by controversy over the management of public assets and resources. One of the longest-serving cabinet ministers (and the longest serving in the same ministry), Eng. Nasasira is named in the Chogm report together with VP Bukenya for interfering with procurement of the Chogm cars, contrary to the law. Mr Nasasira is also accused of neglect of duty and of bending procurement procedures to favour one of the bidders. The State Minister for Regional Cooperation was embroiled in a scandal over the procurement of a National Identity Card project when a personal cheque he presented of Shs28 million to facilitate an 11-member team to visit pre-qualified companies bounced. The minister's personal involvement in the matter contravened the Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Authority regulations but he was never held accountable. The project, which was halted following complaints from one of the bidders, is yet to get off the ground. Mr Musumba is still in Cabinet. As State Minister for Tourism Serapio Rukundo solicited for $3m (sh6b) from the finance ministry to help the proprietor of J&M Airport Hotel complete it ahead of the 2007 Commonwealth summit. According to the Auditor General's report, J&M was not on the list of approved Chogm venues and no activity was supposed to have been hosted there. The government gave the hotel $1.3m (about sh2.7b) to complete 200 rooms two days before the summit.He denies any wrongdoing. Ethics minister Dr Nsaba Buturo, who has chided top bureaucrats for involving in graft came under the microscope for irregularly picking Shs20 million from Mega FM in Gulu to facilitate the making of a government documentary. He later had the money reimbursed following public outcry."1035,The Monitor (Kampala),11/15/2010,Democratic Party Will Stop Corruption by Example,,UGANDA (95%),,,Newspaper,Emmanuel Mwaka Lutukumoi,ENGLISH,723  words,,15-Nov-10,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (79%)",POLITICAL CORRUPTION (91%); POLITICAL PARTIES (91%); CORRUPTION (90%); LARCENY & THEFT (86%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (78%); MARKETING & ADVERTISING EXPENDITURE (61%); MALARIA (60%); AIDS & HIV (50%) Uganda; Governance; Crime and Corruption,"The Democratic Party will ensure a transparent, accountable and corruption free government cardinal in its manifesto. We believe the political economy of Uganda, the socio-economic, socio -cultural development in this country will be achieved only with an exemplary leadership, which leadership is lacking in Uganda with the current leadership in government being suspects [of corruption]. To get the right answer, Uganda needs the right formula of tackling corruption first with stringent laws that will ensure accountability at all levels. DP will have zero tolerance for corruption and specifically; the Mao-DP administration will redistribute Executive power since we believe that the current ills in government such as corruption and non-accountability arise from the concentration of the power and authority of the state in the Presidency and the emasculation of the capability of other public institution that are intended to ensure the due checks and balances in the transaction of public affairs. Our administration will enforce autonomy of public institutions through independent vetting by commissions and Parliament. DP will institute a serious legal reform to ensure that any public official accused of corruption is immediately relieved of his responsibilities and suspended till the case is fully determined. We have witnessed government officials impeached for corruption but still enjoying the liberty of holding important offices. Democratic Party will not only make zero tolerance a swan song but rather the epitome of its first leadership credentials. The fish rots from the head; it's the head and top leadership that must stand to be counted. The idea of arresting small fish like Teddy Cheeye while dining and basking in peace with big thieves will not be tolerated. Corruption has been institutionalised in Uganda and DP will undo this. It has been breeding under weak public sector management and administration. Whereas poverty is chocking most ordinary Ugandans, a few people are basking in the national wealth. On transparency International rankings, Uganda moved from 126 to 130 out of 180 countries in their indices of 2008/2009. Corruption has flourished in the procurement and administration of public expenditure. IGG reports indicated that local governments are the most corrupt sector of government and because they are closer to the people, corruption impacts directly to the ordinary people. Thefts have always been reported but the criminals have been forgiven, even by the President. That makes him a suspect! We have witnessed corruption cases in the Purchase of junk choppers; the NSSF/ Temangalo saga, The Global Fund where victims of HIV/Aids and Malaria were deprived of their lives through theft of money meant for their treatment. The recently concluded Chogm in Kampala that saw billions stolen by government ministers. These big suspects still hold onto their offices. We won't tolerate this. There are myriads of corruption examples. In northern Uganda, the war ate billions. In 2003 alone over $1.3 billion was spent on the war under classified expenditure. The Northern Uganda Reconstruction Programmes 1 & 2 and the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund have been another den of corruption. Ugandans saw Gulu District chairman, who is DP Party President expose corruption in the Prime Minister's office when he literally broke one of the plastic pangas procured to help resettle people of northern Uganda. The perpetrators are still ministers in these offices. It is estimated that Uganda loses Shs500 billion annually to corruption according to the 2007 African Peer Review Mechanism report. DP President General, also known as Chairman Mao, was voted number two among the least corrupt Ugandans by the Anti-Corruption Coalition Uganda 2009/10. This is a precedent that Uganda needs an exemplary leader. The first victim of the demise of culture and traditions in Uganda after colonialism is the moral sense of shame! Leaders luck morals and they dress to go to office to steal but not to work. DP will heal Uganda from all forms of corruption ranging from actual theft of public funds, to nepotism in public services such as the army. This is our promise to Uganda. The medicine is Mao Mr Emmanuel Mwaka Lutukumoi, the DP National Publicity Secretary, wrote this article on behalf his party leader."1036,The Monitor (Kampala),11/15/2010,This Country Badly Needs a Commission On Corruption [opinion],,UGANDA (79%); NIGERIA (79%),,,Newspaper,Adrian Sibo,ENGLISH,732  words,,15-Nov-10,,EMBEZZLEMENT (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (90%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (79%); BRIBERY (78%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (78%); STARVATION (76%); WAGES & SALARIES (75%); LAWYERS (73%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (73%); POLICE MISCONDUCT (73%); CIVIL SERVICES (72%); LEGISLATION (71%); APPOINTMENTS (68%); CRIMINAL LAW (68%); COST OF LIVING (65%) Uganda; Crime and Corruption,"Prof. Apollo Nsibambi defines corruption in the Ufahamu journal as accepting money or money worth to exercise a legitimate discretion in doing or failing to do one's duty. However, he would appear to make an exception in the case of Namunswa alya ku nswa ze. This is in reference to the king who eats on his kingdom. The national wealth is his property. However, a modern king in a democracy occupies a desired or wanted cultural position and he is appropriately paid for it. But these are kings or emperors who allocate themselves absolute powers over the national wealth which they also extend to their relatives. Mobutu of Congo and Abacha of Nigeria are examples of such dictators who drained their countries' wealth into foreign banks. Areas of corruption are many; they include: bribes, procurement of tenders, false accounting, embezzlement, diversion of public resources, influence peddling abuse of office, nepotism, false claims, creation of ghost employees, etc. The ""watch dogs"" over these areas are; the Solicitor General, Auditor General, Inspector General of Government, Public Procurement and Disposal of Assets and the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament. Accountable officials are the Permanent Secretaries and heads of different parastatal bodies. These officers are charged with full responsibility to account for every penny allocated to their sectors. Ministers have no responsibility whatsoever for any expenditure incurred in their ministries, unless they have specifically ordered for such expenditure in writing. Permanent Secretaries must be able to identify and follow any possible action or practice and ensure appropriate punishment for any discovered offence. There is a statutory provision for such horrid practice in the Constitution and in the Penal Code. There is even a new law which was enacted in 2009 to strengthen the power to control public property. Nevertheless, there are other necessary conditions for integrity in the performance of public affairs. A visionary leader is necessary, but he must also be supported by other necessary institutions and instruments. We have enumerated some above. The visionary leader with a set of programmes to perform will confirm those ""policies, laws and programmes to facilitate administration in place."" However, there are two areas that need examination and realisation. Whoever is entrusted with food should not be starving; the temptation to help oneself would be too strong and even understood! I strongly feel a salary review commission is long overdue. The last such a commission existed in 1989, 21 years ago! Since then, a lot of water has passed under the bridge. Cost of living has doubled several times. Some of those who needed such a review such as Members of Parliament have successfully manoeuvred themselves out of the order for whom such a review would be appointed. Similarly, the Judiciary believed they did not have to wait for a decision of the Executive. The civil servants like doctors and teachers are the ones suffering. The amount of money one Member of Parliament earns, can pay four Permanent Secretaries. The whole government should have one common salary structure. The supervision of the utilisation of public property is so important and extensive that it needs more than the current machinery of the Auditor General, PPDA and PAC. I therefore strongly recommend the creation of a corruption commission into active service. The commission's function would be to follow up the expenditure of every cent as allocated by Parliament or as granted by the Constitution. No more and no less. The commission would ensure that only those for whom the expenditure was intended or the service was provided for is the only beneficiary. How they would ensure that this is the only target will be for the commission to decide. There are surely several ways of doing it. It would depend on each expenditure. We are losing too much in contracts and receiving too little and too poor service. The Auditor General comes in after the mice have escaped. The Minister of Public Service or the Minster of Integrity may wish to go to Cabinet and seek approval to establish the proposed corruption commission and appoint the salary review commission without further delay. These are proposals which the public requests the Minister to accept.

""I have taken your mitigation of non-custodial sentence but as judiciary we should be paragon of justice. I sentence you to one year in prison,"" ruled Justice Mugamba. Kaye, clad in a white shirt and a black suit, was found guilty of receiving a bribe of Shs100,000 from Ms Angella Uwayezu as an inducement to release on bail her three nephews who were facing charges of malicious damage to a property.

""You cannot be the chief suspect in corruption and expect to get rid of the problem,"" Mr Mao said in Budaka where, although he did not provide evidence directly implicating the President in corruption, he still rejected President Museveni's renewed campaign promise to fight corruption. ""The most corrupt top government officials are being shielded from being prosecuted by the President of this country while the poor continue to suffer paying exorbitant taxes which time to time are swindled,"" Mr Mao said. Addressing several rallies in Budaka District, Mr Mao said the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) is not a party but a platform for thieves who are against change knowing that once there is change, they can expect to face the law and also pay back what they have stolen from the government coffers. ""The President's allies are openly swindling government funds under his watch. It's very difficult to fight corruption when he (Museveni) himself is not clean at all,"" Mr Mao said attracting thunderous applause. The DP leader cast himself as a candidate unblemished by accusations of corruption pointing at his leadership as Gulu District chairman which he said is free of graft. This is unlike the central government that is today struggling under the weight of the reported uncontrolled swindling of public resources. ""Leaders,"" Mr Mao said, ""must have the moral authority to discipline corrupt officials. Merely saying we shall deal with them and nothing happens is a 'mafia' style of confusing the entire electorate to think tough measures are [coming] when it is a hoax."" Mr Mao cited the Shs11 billion Temangalo land scandal in which Security Minister Amama Mbabazi was named, Global fund heist in which three ministers were implicated and procurement of junk military choppers as examples of cases of corruption which costs Uganda hundreds of billions of shillings annually. ""These people are walking free and continue using government facilities. As a leader, he (Museveni) would have fired these ministers instead of rotating them within his administration,"" said Mr Mao, adding: ""All these will have to face the law once Mao is entrusted with power come 2011 election."" He also spoke about his plans to shake up the country's economy from the devastation of this administration's privatisation policy that witnessed the divestiture of key state parastatals like the Uganda Commercial Bank, Uganda Railways and other valuable national assets. Taking a swipe at the opposition Forum for Democratic Change whose membership is to a considerable extent drawn from former NRM enthusiasts, Mr Mao said it would be a great mistake to vote for it since there is no difference between them. ""All must be thrown out. Vote DP which is pro-people with integrity,"" he said. ""This generation both have origins in the Luweero Triangle. They all claim that they fought to liberate this country instead they are counter-accusing each other of massive corruption and acquiring wealth in dubious deals.

He said the ruling party is better off writing a manifesto with only one sentence reading: We Shall End Corruption. The listener's understated cynicism carried meaning at a couple of levels. First, the manifesto is bulky, running into hundreds of pages. It is much longer than the 2006 one, possibly because the NRM feels compelled to make a more detailed case why it should be returned to office. Second, that the manifesto can contain endless promises but not much will come of it unless that thing called corruption is checked, possibly not ended as such. As expected, the manifesto says the NRM stands for zero tolerance of corruption. Yeah, it is not like the party would say that it stands for tolerance of corruption. In any case, the manifesto contains a strange proposal that the NRM seeks to implement in the next five years if re-elected. It says ""the President will constitute a committee that investigates political leaders and senior public officers once they have been mentioned in corruption-related scandals and report back to the President within a specific time frame. If in the committee's opinion there is need for further investigation by other institutions like the IGG, then the President shall refer the matter for further investigations and ask the person(s) under investigation to step aside during the time they are being investigated"". Why the presidential committee? With a fairly competent auditor general, an assertive Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament, an inspectorate of government (IGG), an anti-corruption court backed up by a strong anti-corruption law, CID, directorate of public prosecutions, why such a committee? Why? I know the answer. I know. This is a committee to protect high-profile thieves of public money. Today the IGG investigates ""political leaders and senior public officers"" once he receives a sensible enough complaint from whatever source. The IGG is presently prosecuting ""political leaders and senior public officers"" in court. The PAC discusses reports emanating from the auditor general and makes recommendations, which recommendations are almost never acted upon by the executive. Other than PAC, various committees of Parliament have tackled straight-up corruption cases but the executive, which is now so hell-bent against corruption, has done nothing about the reports. It has instead protected the sullied political leaders. It happened in the NSSF-Temangalo land transaction case. It is happening now with Chogm. We must remember that it is President Museveni who asked the auditor general to do a value-for-money audit into Chogm before the matter went to PAC. It is the same President presiding at meetings of Cabinet and the NRM caucus that are suspiciously plotting to kill the Chogm recommendations. It follows that the presidential committee will actively kill any corruption complaints against the high and mighty of the NRM, apart from usurping the powers of the various anti-corruption agencies. If not, the complaints will die in State House/Office of the President. This new committee is superfluous. It is meant to abet corruption, not fight it. It is scandalous to even suggest its creation. Better to spend the money that should have gone to this committee on funding the existing corruption-fighting bodies. And let the current system work as is. There is nothing wrong with it. What is wrong is ignoring the resultant recommendations, especially from PAC. What is wrong is President Museveni's refusal to take political responsibility and ask his ministers, named repeatedly in corruption scandals, to step aside while investigations continue. He has not done it thus far. The new committee will not make him do it. The manifesto is titled ""Prosperity for All: Better Service Delivery and Job Creation."" Corruption will not deliver prosperity for all any time soon. There is more to quarrel with in the NRM manifesto and we shall do so in the coming weeks and months, but there is a lot to like as well. The NRM plans to fully finance the national budget in the next five years. Now, I think I am a patriot of sorts. So I liked the sound of that goal. I just want to know whether there are any new sources of revenue. The promise to ""reduce the procedures required to start and operate business and also amalgamate the 30 commercial laws into 10 so as to improve on Uganda's competitiveness as an investment destination"" also makes sense. I live and work in Kampala. So when I read that ""the central government will take over roads in Kampala and reconstruct all the tarmac roads that are in a sorry state and construct new ones and maintain them"", I jumped. But then I remembered that I have heard that sweet lullaby before. Given that no condition is permanent, I must keep hoping.

This was after Mr Gasasira's file was referred to the Constitutional Court for interpretation of some issues cited by his lawyer Geoffrey Kandebee. Trial magistrate Emmanuel Baguma, said: ""The defence lawyer has raised matters that need to be interpreted by the Constitutional Court and prosecution is in agreement, the proceedings are stayed and the accused is discharged."" Mr Gasasira, 56, who was arrested on Friday by the Inspectorate of Government officials at the Kampala High Court premises, was on Monday produced before the Anti-Corruption Court for plea taking. Mr Gasasira is alleged to be in control and possession of eight apartments situated on block 220 plots 1334, 1337 and 1338 in Banda worth Shs548,205,844. The property are said to be disproportionate to his past and current known sources of income and or assets. The state also alleges that Mr Gasasira is in control and possession of residential houses situated at plot 37, Lake Drive Luzira, worth Shs330,262,946. Some of the issues raised by Mr Gasasira's lawyer that need constitutional interpretation is whether the trial court has jurisdiction to entertain a charge which arises from the investigation proceedings and report of the Inspector General of Government that had been quashed and set aside by the High Court, which proceedings are subjected to the Court of Appeal. Mr Kandebee submitted that the IGG's report findings against Mr Gasasira had been quashed in May by then High Court Judge Yorokamu Bamwine. He also said the charge sheet did not disclose the dates when his client allegedly committed the crime. However, the magistrate dismissed this defence argument. The friction between Mr Gasasira and the Inspectorate of Government began last year after he was interdicted on the orders of the then IGG, Justice Faith Mwondha, on grounds that he had violated the Leadership Code Act by not declaring his wealth. The IGG in her recommendations, wanted Mr Gasasira to be dismissed from public service for reportedly failing to explain the source of his wealth and making a false declaration related to his wealth. His property was to be confiscated by the government or he pays Shs1 billion to the government. He was also to be barred from holding public office for the next five years."1041,The Monitor (Kampala),10/17/2010,Government Auditors On Spot Over Massive Corruption,,UGANDA (92%),,,Newspaper,Chris Obore,ENGLISH,767  words,,19-Oct-10,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (79%)",INTERNAL AUDITS (94%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (92%); INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); ACCOUNTING (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); PUBLIC FINANCE (90%); CONSPIRACY (90%); AUDITS (90%); BANKING & FINANCE (89%); BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (89%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); TREASURY DEPARTMENTS (78%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (50%) Uganda; Crime and Corruption,"Conspiracy by internal auditors and accountants in the government departments breeds the growing theft of public resources, according to information obtained by Sunday Monitor. Investigation carried out by this newspaper shows that audit officials are cutting deals with accounting officials instead of checking the robbery of public funds. The public Finance Act 2003 mandates internal auditors to ensure among others that before any government spending is done, all systems are followed and accountability made. But in almost every report of the Auditor General, there are always findings about public funds being spent without accountability and outside set guidelines. This has raised the question as to whether the internal auditors actually do their job. According to some of the government auditors whom Sunday Monitor spoke to, instead of exposing accounting officers who steal from the public coffers, the internal auditors have reportedly turned into 'internal consultants' who help government accountants to steal public funds. This reportedly explains the difference in findings between reports of the auditor general and internal audit with the latter usually silent on cases where huge funds were spent without accountability. In fact, sources say that most government departments don't even know the fleet of cars they own because the auditors no longer take inventory as they are preoccupied with helping the accounting officials to explain away the theft of monies. The Ministry of Finance especially the accounting officer who controls internal auditors is blamed for the laxity in supervision. A report by the African Peer Review Mechanism National Commission recently revealed that corruption and ineffective public institutions were undermining good governance in the country. And the World Bank in a 2005 report estimated that Uganda loses about $300m (sh510b) per year through corruption and procurement malpractices. Following the increased pilfering of public funds and the outcry from donors, the Finance ministry has now mooted reforms aimed at tightening the noose on internal auditors. Sunday Monitor understands that top bureaucrats in Finance were proposing changes to the Finance Act so that Parliament amends it. Some of the amendments proposed include the change of reporting lines for internal auditors from the Accountant General's Office to the Commissioner Internal audit and inspectorate. ""We are aware that internal audit has not been functioning well that is why we are reforming,"" said Mr Keith Muhakanizi, the deputy secretary to the Treasury. Asked why the Finance ministry was only waking up too late to shake the alleged thieves after they had accumulated enough, Mr Muhakanizi said: ""We are very sorry but we are going to take action."" Although he declined to discuss other proposals in the reforms, sources told Sunday Monitor that the top bureaucrats now want to ensure that instead of transferring the internal auditors after at least every three years, the law should allow for less time so as not allow them ""hold territories for long."" Sunday Monitor also understands that they want internal auditors even after they have been transferred from a department, to explain why things went wrong if the Auditor General discovers anomalies. ""We want the law to demand that the internal auditors' show evidence that they had raised those issues to the accountants if they are later discovered by the Auditor General. We want to compare the reports of the auditor general and internal audit to see who is doing a good job,"" a source said. However, Sunday Monitor also understands that some dedicated internal auditors were not getting support from accounting officers in some ministries, who reportedly do not appreciate their work. Instead of appreciating what the auditors say, the accounting officers reportedly blackmail them and accuse them of witch-hunt. Because of this unhealthy relationship, sources say most internal auditors have adopted the old adage: 'If you can't fight them then join them'. This has resulted into the audit department to be described as ""dead"". According to the Accountant General, Mr Gustavio Bwoch, the proposed amendment to the Finance Act was ""to bring in more controls"" because the one of 2003 appears ineffective. He said there was need to put new things in the law to ensure that auditors do risk management and internal control. Sources said the ministries which usually receive big budgets and donor funds like Water, ICT, Lands, Agriculture, Public Service and Health were mainly blacklisted for their poor use of public funds."1042,The Monitor (Kampala),10/17/2010,'There is No Excuse for Corruption' - Former UK Development Official [interview],,UNITED KINGDOM (95%); AFRICA (93%); RWANDA (92%); UGANDA (92%); EUROPE (79%),,,Newspaper,Stephen Wandera,ENGLISH,808  words,,19-Oct-10,"KAMPALA, UGANDA (92%)",WAR & CONFLICT (90%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (90%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (90%); CORRUPTION (89%); INTERVIEWS (89%); BRITISH PRIME MINISTERS (79%); ELECTIONS (78%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (78%); PRIME MINISTERS (78%); RESIGNATIONS (78%); EMERGING MARKETS (77%); ARMED FORCES (77%); CIVIL SERVICES (75%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (73%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (73%); WEALTHY PEOPLE (72%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (71%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (70%); HUNGER IN SOCIETY (70%); TAXES & TAXATION (64%); ELECTION AUTHORITIES (60%) Uganda; Crime and Corruption,"UK's former Secretary of State for International Development, Ms Clare Short, who resigned after opposing former Prime Minister Tony Blair's decision to send troops to invade recently week attended the first UN Global Forum on Local Governments focusing on the Millennium Development Goals in Kampala.

No government is perfect everywhere in the world. In Uganda or any other African country, not everything has been done right like reducing poverty and hunger against all MDG goals. Some of them have made progress others have been disappointing but overall there has been some progress.

In the last 10 years across Africa there has been economic growth of about 6 per cent. But the question is that how has the money been used? The progress is not as big as you would like but when there is progress it is good. So I feel optimistic about Africa, more people are getting educated and that is good for governments. There is no excuse for corruption and it is the same story in Europe. It is not only an African disease. It has different causes for example if civil servants and the police are paid less than enough to keep the family they are going to make little charges. Now that is strictly corruption but in human terms it is undependable if you are going to work and you cannot look after your family, you have to do something. And on the other hand there are some rich greedy bloody people who take even more and more. This is not understandable and forgivable. In general to stop corruption is through moral lectures. We should all attend to our moral standards; have strong transparent systems of management, accountability and procurement that everyone can scrutinize. No contract should be given out without being published publicly. Have accountability to local people so that they can scrutinize whether they are getting services or someone is milking the system. The other thing is to make the tax system fair and transparent and not letting some people not pay tax. In some countries, the rich tend to grab more and the public has to gang up and demand for service and the media has a big role to play. I have not heard of that argument previously but all over the world the whole point of electoral commission is to be independent of the governing party. And indeed not to lean towards the opposition, it should stand up and do a good job to make sure the election is fair. I cannot comment in detail because I have no knowledge about this. I have not been following closely what happens in Uganda ever since I was out of the International Development. I believe in transparency and people in different countries in Africa say we have been given a blessing of these rich resources like mineral, oil and should not be a curse. Uganda has seen it from other countries of bad examples and should be getting it right. Transparency is the key to making sure that money is well spent. There is a global movement of all oil and mineral companies to be public on the payments they make to governments. This enables civil society to scrutinize and is a very good system to ensure that the people benefit from the natural wealth. I hope that Uganda would be transparent for the good of its people. I saw in the media that Uganda President had said Uganda would send up to 20,000 troops and of course Uganda is angry after the bomb blast in Kampala. My argument is that the western policy towards Somalia has been mistaken and Somalis have suffered and scattered all over the world. United States under George Bush administration and Ethiopia went in Somalia before and failed. The trouble still goes on in Somalia. They have to make a bigger effort from bottom-top approach so that the people themselves can make peace and the international community comes in with logistical support of food and water. If I was Uganda, I would be cautious about sending more troops because other countries have gone in and pulled out. There is a lot of killing. It is not my duty to tell Uganda what to do but I would say be careful Uganda others have been stung. I did stand down in May this year and I am here in Uganda with the African Humanitarian Action as a trustee looking at cities alliance. People are moving away from rural areas to urban centers and we are trying to make sure they have decent housing jobs and other basic necessities. This would promote more production and markets. African Humanitarian Action is based in Addis Ababa and we also look at Africa providing relief to Africans first instead of relief coming from outside."1043,The Monitor (Kampala),10/8/2010,Are Citizens Losing the Fight Against Corruption?

So there cannot be any excuse for corruption by feigning ignorance of it. Corruption in Uganda has reached unacceptable levels. In a civilised nation, one would expect that law enforcement agencies would be the first resort in the fight against corruption. We now know that the police force is one of the most corrupt institutions in Uganda. We also know that there are more ghosts in the army than in the city cemetery. One would also ordinarily turn to the judicial system. Yet, the judiciary is only in competition with the police in perpetration of corruption. Some magistrates have been known to take bribes to muzzle cases and deliver favourable judgements. Others have been accused of forging court proceedings (for trials that never took place) leading to conviction of innocent persons at the behest of influential, well-greased ""clients"" . Who, then, will fight corruption? Parliament as an institution lost its respect when a large number of MPs in the seventh Parliament accepted a Shs5 million bribe to push through the obnoxious amendment that lifted presidential term limits. The population has lost confidence in law enforcement agencies. This could explain why incidences of mob action are frequent. While I would not engage in an act of mob action, I am not sure I can walk into a police station to register a complaint, for I just don't imagine I can get the help I would need. Nor can I file a case in any Ugandan court with the hope of obtaining justice. I don't think I am alone. In the good old days of the now banned Ekimeeza (field radio talk show), a participant suggested that the only way forward in the fight against corruption would be to arrest the corrupt, try them quickly, confiscate their property if found guilty, and kill them by firing squad. From the audience came a voice ""like Ghana's Rawlings did"", before another one said Amin yeyali abasobola (it is Amin who could manage them - the corrupt). When an adult Ugandan whose political instincts are developed enough to participate in a political radio show prays for another Amin, you know that the people are getting desperate. And here lies the risk to Uganda's democratic experiment. Not perfect by any measure, Uganda's experience with democracy was beginning to hold. Now we run the risk of a drastic undemocratic action by a possibly opportunistic group who would promise to rid the nation of corrupt people. They would then execute a few corrupt people by firing squad, and confiscate their property amidst cheers from a hitherto frustrated population. This euphoria would then last a few months, before the ""saviours"" degenerate into another corrupt dictatorship. A few months ago, I spoke to a group of university students. As usual, the subject of nepotism, a form of corruption, came up. They had earlier lamented that government jobs and lucrative scholarships were accessible to youths from a certain ethnic group. I encouraged them to forget about looking for jobs in government and try entrepreneurship . One female student angrily accused me of accepting the ""status quo"". I tried to explain to her that it was possible to wrestle government control from the corrupt rulers through democracy, by voting them out in the next elections. I thought I had succeeded. Then she shouted: ""Elections? Which elections? Can there be a real election in Uganda?"" she continued: ""To hell with elections and your democracy. What we need is change. Not democracy"". This is the extent of the cross-cutting frustration that has afflicted not only rural folk, but also urbanites and educated young people. What I know, though, is that the fight against corruption begins with you. No one else can do it for you.

He said many practicing advocates are currently being investigated by the Uganda Law Council over illegal misconduct. ""This matter of ethics and integrity in the legal profession is very serious and we are fighting tooth and nail to ensure that our profession doesn't become a laughing stock,"" Dr Makubuya said. The attorney General, who also doubles as Minister for Justice and Constitutional Affairs, said last month alone , the Uganda Law Council received 47 complaints against advocates. ""All these cases are before the council's disciplinary committee and those found guilty will be punished accordingly because they have failed to adhere to the strict code of conduct laid down in the Advocates Act,"" he said. In the last couple of months, the media has been awash with stories of advocates being reported to the Uganda Law Council for illegal conduct. And some of the offences committed are quite mind-boggling. The minister issued the warning yesterday during the 37th graduation ceremony of the Law Development Centre. 698 students were awarded diplomas and certificates. They were part of those who passed their exams in the last academic year (2008/09) and others who re-sat various papers in previous years. Some of the notable personalities who graduated include former minister Gen. Moses Ali, former ISO boss Brig. Henry Tumukunde, Democratic Party Legal Advisor Fred Mbidde and MPs Michael Mabikke (Makindye West), Susan Nakawuki (Busiro East) and Samuel Odonga Otto (Aruu County). Dr Makubuya challenged the fresh law graduates to exhibit and uphold high professional ethics and avoid temptations to amass quick wealth through cheating clients. ""The challenge you face as fresh graduates is to salvage the legal profession from corruption. Those moving to private practice should avoid acting without instruction. Keep the position of trust and never connive to cheat clients,"" he cautioned, adding, ""You have been taught civil law here and I don't expect you to apply jungle law like some unscrupulous advocates in town."" The Deputy Chief Justice Laetitia Mukasa Kikonyogo, who presided as chief guest commended the Centre for accelerating high academic and professional standards. She urged government to increase its funding to the institution to enable it facilitate its academics and developmental programmmes. LDC Director, Elijah Wante also asked government to regulate the operations of court bailiffs and auctioneers if they are to effectively contribute in the administration of justice in the country. Mr Wante said some court bailiffs were acting unprofessionally thus tainting the image of the legal profession. Court bailiffs and clerks are only trained at LDC under the Centre's short law courses. He said courses for court bailiffs, auctioneers and clerks have low intake because there are no regulations compelling persons carrying out those jobs to acquire basic training in laws and procedures relating to their work."1045,The Monitor (Kampala),9/4/2010,Voters Must Reject Politicians Implicated in Corruption [opinion],,UGANDA (96%),,,Newspaper,Margaret Wokuri,ENGLISH,600  words,,6-Sep-10,,POLITICAL CORRUPTION (90%); TAXES & TAXATION (90%); POLITICS (90%); ELECTIONS (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); CORRUPTION (86%); TERM LIMITS (76%); HOUSEHOLD NUMBERS (74%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (72%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (69%); FARM LABOR (69%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (69%); ELECTION AUTHORITIES (68%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION (64%); SECONDARY SCHOOLS (52%); HOTELS & MOTELS (50%) Uganda; Governance; Crime and Corruption,"Three stories in the Saturday Vision of August 28, summarise the essence of this article. On the front page was a revelation of 187 billion lost in government companies; the second story said ""Kawolo Hospital a death Trap"" and the last and most absurd was ""War erupts over Museveni Cash"" carried in the 'Crazy Krazy World' pictures. In the pictorial, the President is pictured handing over the characteristic envelop to performers and thereafter, a war erupts over the said cash. One man is left in only underwear yet, even after losing both his clothes and dignity, this man according to the caption, did not get the money! At an average 18 per cent Vat, Ugandans pay an average of Shs450 in taxes on the basics like soap, sugar, and tooth paste. A person who uses at the lower end of 12 bars of soap in a year pays Shs5,400 in taxes and so is sugar. Meanwhile, peasants who use paraffin pay Shs250 in taxes per litre. A household that uses two litres per month therefore parts with Shs6,000 a year in taxes. If we multiplied Shs6,000 with the number of households that use paraffin in this country, it is a wholesome figure. It is not a surprise that today, the government boasts of seven or so trillion collections. However, when it comes to service delivery, the tax payer is offered 'Death Traps' for health facilities, poor education in universal primary and secondary education, mass unemployment and humiliating poverty resulting into able-bodied young men stripping each other over presidential envelops! A closer look at the loss of huge monies in government companies, poor state of health, poverty and government insistence on the current Electoral Commission reveals corruption as a linking thread. Last weekend, a group of civil society (NAFFE, NGO Forum, ACODE and PAC - Soroti), held another Citizen's Parliament in Soroti under the theme 'Tracking Corruption: one sure way to guarantee free and fair elections and accountable democratic governance in the country'. The Citizen's Parliament is a deliberate move to take the debate about public loot to the countryside because underneath Uganda's challenges is corruption with impunity. Making corruption a high political risk, these CSOs believe, may yield better results than merely begging politicians to fight the vice. In Soroti, after listening to the findings of the Chogm probe report, presented by Parliament's Public Accounts Committee chairman Hon. Nandala Mafabi, they (the people) adopted the resolutions passed by the Citizen's Parliament held a few weeks ago at Hotel Africana, they emphasised that the two - term presidential term limits be restored to avoid a situation where a regime can hold Ugandans hostage; they demanded the reconstitution of the Electoral Commission which they said was a prerequisite for free and fair elections. The current EC, they said, has been proven to be compromised. The people of Soroti also called upon political parties to front only candidates with a clear and proven track record; they said political parties should punish and recall any implicated persons from party leadership positions and that those parties that do not comply would be seen as condoning corruption. Emphasising this, they said, ""We shall reject any leaders who have been implicated in corruption scandals and also reject the political parties that front them."" Finally, they resolved that in picking their leaders, they would follow the Guide to Responsible Choice of Leaders that was launched by Bishop Zac Niringiye at the same function.

It is, however, not enough to stop at studies and reports. What is urgent is to repeal the Uneb Act 1983 so as to address the critical issues documented in the report. Among the 10 functions of Uneb as per the Act, Article 4 clause (i): ""Uneb shall make rules regulating the conduct of examinations and for all purposes incidental thereto."" However, I feel the rules therein have not addressed the prevailing examination malpractice conclusively. The rules ought to purge gaps existing in examination management ranging from setting, briefing, moderating, scouting, and monitoring, distributing, collecting, marking, releasing of results and awarding certificates. A new law should be put in place and existing ones strengthened to address flaws in examinations at all levels. This should take into account issues like the security of examination papers and supervision of exams, among others. The Act should be improved to clearly spell out the duration and tenure of officers for some key examination offices notably chief examiners, team leaders and checkers. Rotational methods and replacement of those whose terms have expired should be considered in the new law. Though there can be renewal of tenure of service, the new law should address the need to check on the unchangeable chiefs whose permanency in some positions is responsible for the various challenges and unethical conduct like favouritism extended to specific schools (both public and private). The need for regulation, redeployment and rotation of officers as a way of addressing these challenges, is urgent. Though the 1983 Uneb Act states that all proceedings of the board shall be strictly confidential, the new law should clarify what level of confidentiality to be considered as classified. Aware of the fact that Uneb continues to administer its oath of secrecy to all examiners, there is need to clarify what should be secret and what shouldn't, according to the law. This legal instrument will permanently check the abnormal and exorbitant examination fees that head teachers levy on many parents, guardians and students. The law should also take into account ways of holding accountable head teachers who collect, misuse or disappear with examination fees instead of remitting it to Uneb. Also, under the new law, officers who become members of Uneb committees must be of clean record and without private or personal businesses that can injure the integrity of the examination body. These measures, if implemented, will check corruption in the education sector.

This could be because ""anti-people"" sounds more forceful and hits directly at the body. The expression is simple and is readily understood by even those peasants who have next to no formal education. But it is also possible that NRM ideologues were genuinely trying to get to the heart of the matter; because, ultimately, what is the value of patriotism (the passionate love of one's country) if you feel nothing for the people, living organisms that think and suffer? Last Sunday, I imagined a set of shareholders and their family members who brought down their own retail trade business by stealing massively from it. I compared a set of rulers and powerful citizens who stole from their country to those shareholders. But the comparison of course is not entirely accurate. Our fictional Wochumi Supermarket would probably not survive regular thefts exceeding 10 per cent of its stock. But even with over 40 per cent reported to be the level of theft in Uganda government transactions, the country never quite shuts down. I suppose it has something to do with the movement of money, goods and services. When Wochumi is robbed, the goods and the money go elsewhere; Wochumi collapses. When the country's Treasury is directly or indirectly looted, some of the money may be siphoned to foreign destinations: banks, real estate, company shares, luxury goods stores and even gambling houses. But most of the dirty money is very likely spent or invested at home. The processes of converting it into tangible (even if redundant) wealth, of hiring labour and paying for services and utilities ensure that a lot of this money is recycled back into the national economy, with the tax-collector nibbling from it at every turn. It was probably because of this phenomenon that President Museveni once reportedly said (if I am not dreaming), that the country could develop with (or, maybe, in spite of) corruption. But either way, something very significant is happening. Instead of, say, a good 100km highway, we get a low quality 60km job. Some of the money has gone into several private mansions for the honchos who negotiated and gave out the contract. Apart from starving our infrastructure to the carcass we have, this transfer of resources from public works, health, security, education and agriculture to the private interests of the privileged translates into poverty for the masses, as they cannot access quality public services and seek costly solutions from the private sector. Many simply give up. Furthermore, the ease with which protected powerful thieves amass wealth distorts the very concept of work and reward, alienating and demoralizing the genuine worker, and accelerating the growth of the gap between rich and poor. It is a bomb that tomorrow's revolutionaries could choose to ignite. Under NRM rule, the characterisation of previous regimes as anti-people has been mainly on the basis of their violence, brutality and repression. Periodically, the present regime itself unleashes strong doses of that savagery. But as we have seen, the effects of massive corruption alone under the NRM are also blows struck against the people. From Germany to China and the defunct Soviet Union, not to mention Latin America and Africa's banana republics, every dictatorship has worked against the people in the name of patriotism. It is a camouflage that Uganda's current rulers have decided to brandish in the country's schoolrooms. But what value will the young read in the rhetoric of patriotism when the ruling class is so markedly anti-people?

At 19.4 percent of complaints recorded at the IGG, mismanagement and misappropriation of public resources is the most reported form of corruption. Ugandans also view and complain about non-payment of salaries at 18.7 per cent, followed by abuse of office at 17.8 per cent, delays in delivery of services, which often leads to solicitation and offering of bribes stands at 9.1 per cent. Property disputes, also viewed as a form of corruption stand at 7.3 per cent. The report released by IGG Raphael Baku also reveals forgery and uttering of false documents, embezzlement, tenders and contracts manipulation, bribery and extortion, victimization or oppression, conflict of interest, false claims and tax evasion among the issues that irk many Ugandans. The report details how worsening corruption is hamstringing delivery of government services to ordinary citizens and rendering key public institutions useless. The report released yesterday, covering the financial year ending December 2009, puts Kampala in the lead of most complained-about administrative units while district local governments top public institutions perceived to be corrupt. Kampala has the highest number of complaints at 418, followed by Fort Portal Municipality (56), Masaka (54), Arua (46) and Jinja (40), among others. The least complained about administrative areas are Mbale (13) and Moroto (16), implying outwardly that staff in these areas are less thieving. Mr Baku said: ""The complaints in the report are just a small fraction of the problems of corruption out there. Many people [suffer silently] and have not come out to report."" In the latest report, districts have for the third year running topped the list of the most complained-about institutions. This may be because ordinary citizens interface more with district, rather than central government, employees on daily basis and get first-hand brush with money-hungry bureaucrats. The IGG, for instance, reports that bidders often offer bribes to Chief Administrative Officers (CAOs) and other officials --- so in the end, service providers do substandard work which the bribe-takers ironically monitor! ""Individual public officials have continued to use their offices for private gain,"" reads the report. Despite the establishment of various institutions, among them the IGG, the Police Criminal Investigations Directorate and the Directorate of Public Prosecutions, to catch thieves in government, critics say less political will exists to follow through arrests, prosecutions and punishments of perpetrators. The World Bank estimated in 2005 that Uganda loses about $300 million (Shs600 billion) through corruption and procurement malpractices every year, much of this being money meant for providing clean water, quality education, good roads and medicines in public health facilities. President Museveni has vowed to abolish the vice but majority Ugandans interviewed in a survey joint commissioned by Daily Monitor and European Union's Deepening said soaring corruption is NRM's biggest failure. Yesterday, Mr Baku said fraudulent contract awards, shoddy works, fraudulent recruitment and unfair administrative decisions fuel corruption in the country. That trend, he said, would only change if citizens get motivated that corrupt official they report are tried and punished. Police prominently feature in the latest report, mainly on cases of bribe-taking, mismanagement, delayed service, victimisation/oppression, conflict of interest and misconduct. In the reporting period, the IGG received a total 827 corruption-related complaints, up from 739 complaints reported between January-July 2009."1049,The Monitor (Kampala),6/27/2010,Can God Help Uganda to Fight Corruption?

The same survey also found that more people here got involved in the practice of witchcraft than in many other countries. Nine out of 10 people for religion (Christianity or Islam) and two out of 10 for witchcraft. Those findings are completely consistent with my expectations, as several articles in this column prior to the survey have indicated. Indeed, the actual figures for both may be even closer. Why? Because a lot of people think it is disreputable or primitive to be involved with witchcraft and only visit their witchdoctor when nobody is looking. Some of these may not have owned up when providing the research data. We are in the realm of superstition. The mindset that conjures up images of angels, resurrected super mortals and watchful saints who died way back and takes them for real is exactly the same as that in which ancestors and evil spirits are believed to be active forces affecting people's lives. If they are active and have a closer relationship with the gods than living mortals, then the believer can appeal to them to intercede for him in his quest for the blessings of the divine. When they are thought to be angry or neglected, or when their help is required in the face of a special task, it sounds reasonable to offer gifts or sacrifices - sometimes even human sacrifices - to them. In this realm, almost anything can be believed, and nothing is subject to scientific proof. I don't know whether President Museveni believes in the world of gods and other supernatural beings, but he must have noted the statistics, and as a perpetually vote-hungry ruler, he would not hesitate to tap into this pool of believers. In as much as he preaches about the value of a scientific education and science-related skills, the President has decided that his latest action over the plague of corruption would be completely unscientific. He declared a day of prayers for the country's key institutions. If there is any evidence at all, it is that the more a country prays, the greater its harvest of corruption will be. Or, maybe, the more corrupt a country is, the greater its hypocrisy; hence more journeys to churches and mosques. However, as arranged, the bad, the ugly and the horrible all came together; the executive, the army, the police, the tax collectors and so on, and it seems Gen. Museveni was a kind of high priest at the gathering, doing his own bit of praying and preaching. From what we all know about human behaviour, the bubbles of laughter from the bellies of the participants must have been suffocating under the external solemnity of an otherwise comic exhibition. You can see the palms covering their faces in prayer. Some of their fingers are slightly spread open, and through the gaps they stare as gangster after gangster rises to make confessions on behalf of their institution and to register their contrition. The very cheeky are literally on the verge of bursting with laughter. Those who didn't know were happily informed a few years ago by the First Lady that President Museveni was sent to us by God. Much earlier, with a touch of humour, the President had famously said that he was next to God. In other words, so immense was his power. But if in this special position the President cannot independently deal with his corrupt officials; if in private he trembles at the thought of punishing them; if, indeed - God forbid - if only the little finger on his left hand was ever (even once) in cahoots with them, then God can only be taken seriously as the Chief of the Universe, and a chief capable of helping Uganda, if he assigned to the country another president.

""Not withstanding the stability we have enjoyed for the last 24 years, there are things that have gone against our expectation... Like embezzlement, illicit enrichment and misuse of public funds,"" the statement reads. ""We shall gather together for a special day of prayer and repentance so that we may thank God and seek his mercy and forgiveness for this great chosen nation."" He added: ""Ugandans who may not be able to come to Kololo may gather in convenient places within their locations for the same purpose on that day."" The national prayers are expected to attract all regardless of political or religious affiliation. Ms Wabudeya was accompanied by Ethics Minister James Nsaba Buturo. Human rights activists said although the country urgently needs the prayers, the government also has failed in some areas. Mr Livingstone Sewanyana, the executive director of the Foundation for Human Rights Initiative, said praying to God is one thing and doing what God expects of us is another. Mr Museveni cautioned that Uganda risks losing out on God's blessings for if disobedience prevails ""on the other hand, we stand to gain if, we obey God.""

""The supplier delivered the items but later connived with some of the beneficiaries and bought the supplies, which is contrary to the laws,"" Mr Ssekate explains. He adds that four people including the supplier and beneficiaries have been arrested and charged with misappropriation of Naads fund. However, Ssekate says that had it not been police intelligence led investigations, it would have been difficult to track the misappropriation since it was committed by the supplier and beneficiaries. According to the World Bank estimates, Uganda loses over Shs500billion every year to corruption. Therefore the president says that if police have information that some officials are stealing Naads money, they can arrest them to save such funds. General Kale Kayihura says that the area police will be given copies of the documents that state the amount of money or any kind of funding from Naads or Nusaf dispensed to the grassroots so as to monitor the implementation of the programmes. ""It is now the work of the police to investigate misuse of funds by government officials in the country. It is the work of the intelligence officers and Criminal Investigations Department to investigate and produce reports on corruption before any other person does so,"" he says. Naads has spent over Shs48billion on agriculture programmes in 929 rural sub counties and 137 urban councils within 80 districts in the country. But often local leaders collude with suppliers and beneficiaries to meet their own selfish needs. In Lyantonde District, police investigation allegedly found anomalies in the construction of Mukokoma Market, a valley dam at Kibeija village, sourcing and distribution of 42 Boer goats, and the tarmac of Lyantonde High Street. Detectives discovered that the contracted suppliers of 42 Boer goats only supplied four Boers while the rest were local goats contrary to the agreement but the district officials sanctioned the deal. The district officials allegedly certified that the goats supplied were of a good quality yet it wasn't the case. Such misuse of funds can't be detected in instances where there is a chain of collusion. But President Museveni says that the only way such thefts can be controlled is by getting a third party which is the police to monitor implementation of such programmes."1052,The Monitor (Kampala),5/24/2010,Government Has Exhibited the Will to Fight Corruption [opinion],,UGANDA (79%),,,Newspaper,Moses Byaruhanga,ENGLISH,642  words,,24-May-10,,LAWYERS (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (90%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (90%); DISMISSALS (77%); APPOINTMENTS (77%); BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (76%); CIVIL SERVICES (73%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (73%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (72%); APPROVALS (70%); TRIAL & PROCEDURE (68%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (68%) Uganda; Crime and Corruption; Legal and Judicial Affairs,"The NRM government has been accused of lack of a political will to fight corruption. First the criticism has been on lack of the use of institutions. It's the NRM government that created the institution of inspectorate of government. At first it had no powers to prosecute, dismiss people or take any corrective action against officers found wanting. The powers of the IGG have now been strengthened to enforce non-compliance with the Leadership Code. The office has also powers to prosecute its own cases. When NRM came to power, the Auditor General was an officer in the Ministry of Finance. The office didn't have the independence it desired to hold government officers accountable. It's the NRM that brought reforms in the institution of the Auditor General. As a result, the office is independent of the Ministry of Finance and it is self accounting like any other government department. The office holder is appointed by the President and approved by Parliament. In short, the Auditor General is an independent institution which can carry out its mandate without fear of victimisation. This also applies to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). In the past this office was under the Attorney General. In fact the DPP was a department under the Solicitor General as a civil servant who could be transferred by the Solicitor General to another department within the ministry. Such a person could not be independent to prosecute government officials senior to his rank like a permanent secretary or even a Solicitor General. It's the NRM government in the making of the 1995 Constitution that gave independence to the DPP and made the office holder serve on the same terms with a judge of the High Court. The DPP, the IGG and the Auditor General cannot be easily removed from office by anyone be it Parliament or the Executive. There are other institutions like PPDA which I think is doing a commendable job. In 2005 when the NRM-dominated Parliament was discussing the rules of procedure of a multiparty Parliament, it was agreed that the accountability committees like PAC and the one on local government should be chaired by opposition to give that independence to avoid a chairperson from the ruling party chairing a committee that questions his/her colleagues in government. That is why Nandala Mafabi, Reagan Okumu, Abdul Katuntu from FDC chair the accountability committees. If NRM didn't have the political will to fight corruption, it would never have allowed that. What they need is to be fair in their judgments. For instance in the much awaited Chogm report, I was amazed to read that ministers Isaac Musumba and Mwesigwa Rukutana had been condemned without a hearing. Recently, a company called Bolton bought space in the Daily Monitor clarifying on the communication equipment they supplied of which minister Amama Mbabazi is accused of having varied the price from $3.2m to $5m. They clarified that the price of $3.2m was given to police in 2004. That when contacted in 2006 with modifications to the specifications of 2004, their price was $4.8m which was negotiated downwards to $4.5m. Now what is Mbabazi's crime? The company also claims it was never given a hearing. Minister Sam Kutesa on the other hand is accused of having had shares in a company that supplied vehicles. He clarified that he had sold the said shares two years earlier. In my opinion, while we appreciate the work of PAC, their report should be sent to anti corruption institutions like DPP and IGG who have powers to prosecute any company or individual found wanting or in the case of IGG can recommend administrative action against any officer or recommend recovery of the money where necessary. Suppose now on the floor of Parliament the report is not adopted, what would be next?

But lately, the one question on my mind is, are things really as bad as they appear to be? Chogm is just one of many projects that implementers have used to enrich themselves at the expense of Ugandans. I get disturbed by the level of opulence in ministries and government agencies with so many projects that have delivered so little despite lots of funding. We would get so scandalised if we considered other forms of corruption other than acceptance of bribes, say nepotistic allocations or diversion of public resources for economic or political benefit. The general violation of formal rules of conduct that occurs between public officials is almost public policy. Little wonder, some people are putting their hope in having the donors do something in order for government to make good on its pledge to fight corruption. But does government need a form of carrot and stick to deal with corruption? Where is government commitment? Members of the ruling party often argue that there is zero tolerance to corruption demonstrated by the numerous policy, legal and institutional frameworks. The Global Integrity Report 2009 actually placed Uganda's legal framework to fight corruption at 99 per cent. So why does it seem like corruption is worsening? Weak implementation of existing frameworks or legality is simply not enough to tackle corruption. So what must be done? I believe to effectively tackle corruption, strengthening citizen participation will be a starting point. Secondly, developing mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation systems, if well implemented, will reduce opportunities for corruption. I might be reminded that government has set up these systems. The Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development established the Monitoring and Analysis Unit in 1999 and in 2002, a Poverty Monitoring and Evaluation Strategy completely integrated with the policy process. This was in 2005 subsumed into the National Integrated Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (NIMES), not forgetting the Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys. Yet, in spite of these developments, we are told that the Poverty Eradication Action Programme which led to these developments largely failed due to implementation hitches laced by corruption. This means the M&E systems were not effectively implemented. Partly, the problem is that much of the M&E we engage in is donor driven and for them. In effect, the whole process of M&E is plagued by corruption. Officials in government largely commission consultants either working for them, or who will not damage their image in the final report and also give kick backs. We must view combating corruption as primarily government responsibility and duty to citizens rather than to donors. We must also desist from reducing corruption only to a lens through which we view activities of the state. Unless we actively reject being part of corruption as citizens, we do not have any moral justification to demand that government fights corruption or expect it to succeed in its attempt to do so. Along side an excellent and independent monitoring and evaluation system, a sound management information system accessible by the public and adequately used by the media and civil society to demand accountability will reduce corruption. Citizens can also act by electing credible leaders whose integrity can not be questioned, are mindful of their role in championing economic development, and who will rise above petty party politics on issues that derail good governance like corruption.

However, the recent general election in the United Kingdom could teach the rest of us a thing or two. It is not so much all that stuff about a smooth handing over of power. But there is this thing about a ruler's mortal status. I am not referring to the inevitability of death; indeed, I wouldn't care if President Museveni decided to live for ever. It is the human scale I am looking at; the scale at which the outgoing premier (Gordon Brown) and the new leader (David Cameron) have been operating. During the campaigns, the barely audible use of the word ""bigoted"" (moreover not referring to any of the candidates) was enough to get Mr Brown into trouble, and an apology from the then Prime Minister did not make the universe collapse over his head. Britain has huge problems, at home and abroad, but at his defeat, Brown has expressed his faith that the relatively inexperienced Cameron is competent enough to serve. On his way out of Downing Street, Brown spoke of how his office had given him access to the best in human nature, but also to human frailties, including (he emphasised) his own. Frailties? The day President Museveni speaks of his frailties should be declared an annual public holiday! One need not be personal. President Museveni is only the head of the ruling pack. Can his NRM transcend the frailties of the individuals within it and give the nation a spell of ""strong, stable, good and decent government"", such as the new premier (Cameron) has promised his Tory-Lib Dem coalition will try to give Great Britain? The NRM could win or steal next year's general election. To my mind, the mother of NRM weaknesses is its contempt of Uganda's citizens. If you contemplate how shabbily our people are used, robbed, bribed, insulted, told lies, how they have their constitution used like a rag, or how the opposition is hounded and the NRM caucus and parliamentary majority abused, you realise that the ruling elite can only do this because its members thoroughly despise the citizens. And as we approach the 2011 general election, the signs are that instead of trying to cleanse and renew itself, the NRM is set to continue on the path of separating power from public morality. Several weeks down the road, the NRM delegate's conference will elect its new leadership. There has been in Uganda a serious joke about a ""queue"" of people waiting to replace President Museveni. That could be decades away, but the very idea of a queue reflects the contempt for the citizenry that I have referred to. It implies that the NRM has laid out a plan of inheritance, quite regardless of the dynamics of a democratic process. Hence, Dr Kiiza Besigye, who wanted to become President from the opposition, was said to have jumped the queue. But now a monkey called CHOGM and the impending elections have exposed the ideological and moral bankruptcy of the NRM. The party leaders and white collar gangsters of yesterday are the same rolling in the mud today, and they are the same lined up for the leading roles in the party tomorrow. Unfortunately, or by design, there is absolutely no hint that the party Chairman and President of the republic, or the NRM party disciplinary machinery, would want any of these leaders excluded on moral grounds. If Gen Museveni ""wins"" again, these men and women will probably still be up there in power, strengthening the bond between corruption and the NRM government. It should be interesting to watch the first encounter between the youngster, David Cameron (43), and a ""re-elected"" and power hardened veteran, Gen. Museveni.

The donors say they will not settle for anything less than strict enforcement of recommendations of anti-corruption bodies notably Parliament's Public Accounts Committee, the Inspector General of Government, the Auditor General and the Police Criminal Investigations Department among others. The extent of donor frustration is partly reflected in a Shs8.1 billion cut in budget support, but the European Union head of delegation, Ambassador Vincent De Visscher, said more drastic measures could be seen when they hold their conference in September. While speaking on Kfm's Hot Seat talk show in Kampala last week, Ambassador De Visscher said: ""We are glad the government has agreed to tackle corruption. The President has taken a zero stand on corruption but we want to see that followed by real action."" ""We are waiting for the results of the PAC report and we are hoping it will be debated and we will be watching for action to be taken."" He revealed that if the report is not followed by action, questions will be raised by development partners. Ambassador De Visscher said his concerns are shared by other development partners and not just the European Union. He dismissed claims that some accounting officers implicated by reports on corruption were following directives from their political supervisors, mainly ministers. The ambassador said permanent secretaries should demand that their superiors first sign for money before it is released. ""They should ask the minister to sign [for the money] or say they will resign other than do something wrong."" ""EU tax payers will not understand if money is misused and no action is taken. I have to show accountability for the taxpayers' money,"" he said. Ambassador De Visscher also disclosed that EU is not happy with the rampant corruption in procurement, saying it will cost the country Shs8.1 billion donation out of Shs81.7 billion in budget support. He, however, said Uganda has to compete for donor support with other countries because the terrain has changed following the effects of the global financial crisis. He disclosed that donor support will tremendously decrease as Uganda begins to reap from oil."
